"1","Kat Sullivan was on a plane to Orlando, Fla., in February when she watched ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚<U+0080>ù for the first time, a movie about a woman who puts pressure on the local police to find her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s killer by renting out a series of giant advertising signs.That, Ms. Sullivan thought, was a good idea.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m getting a goddamn billboard,‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That woman totally epitomizes the feeling of just having to do something.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said that she was sexually abused and then raped by a former teacher when she was a student at the Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., in the 1990s. A report commissioned by Emma Willard concluded that a teacher there named Scott Sargent had been fired for sexually abusing a student but was still given letters of recommendations to teach elsewhere; Ms. Sullivan was that student.Because the abuse took place 20 years ago, the statute of limitations has long since run out, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So, using money from a settlement she received from the school, she bought a month‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth of ad space on three digital billboards, each about 50 feet wide, to call attention to the case.One billboard is in Albany, not far from Emma Willard. Another is on I-95 in Fairfield, Conn., near a school where Mr. Sargent later taught. The third is alongside I-90 in Springfield, Mass., near the town where Mr. Sargent lives today.Three images will rotate through each billboard. One points people to Ms. Sullivan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, and says, across a picture of a man with a question mark over his chest, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the truth will be revealed.‚<U+0080>ù Another is a picture of Ms. Sullivan and says: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My rapist is protected by New York state law. I am not. Neither are you. Neither are your children.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said the original design included Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and face, but that the company that owns the billboards would not allow her to use them, for fear of getting sued. Two billboard companies said they would not work with her at all.The three billboards will be up for 28 days, Ms. Sullivan said, which will cost her $14,000. (She spent about another $2,000 on the website.) Once the billboards come down, Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and photograph will appear on her website.Mr. Sargent did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement, Emma Willard said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We commend and support the survivors of sexual abuse who are committed to affecting change on this important issue.‚<U+0080>ùThe third graphic that will rotate through the billboards says ‚<U+0080><U+009C>NY Pass The Child Victims Act,‚<U+0080>ù a piece of proposed legislation in Albany that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges and allow them to sue until age 50. It would also create a one-year ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lookback‚<U+0080>ù window, during which cases from any time could proceed in court. Today, the statutes of limitations in New York that govern the sexual abuse of children are among the most restrictive in the country. Most adult survivors had until they were 23 years old, at the latest, to bring a case.Activist groups have been pushing the Child Victims Act in Albany for more than 10 years, and have made an especially aggressive effort this year, targeting specific state senators. Ms. Sullivan moved to New York City last month from her home in Florida to help lobby for the measure.Supporters are trying to make the act part of the state budget, which is due April 1 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a tactic that would give Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who supports the bill, more leverage to negotiate with legislators. The Child Victims Act has support from the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, but there is resistance to it in the Republican-controlled State Senate, which has blocked the bill for years. John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader, did not respond to questions about the legislation.A central sticking point is the lookback window. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said on Tuesday that any legislation that included it should be rejected and called the window ‚<U+0080><U+009C>toxic‚<U+0080>ù for the Catholic Church. Representatives of the church have said it supports changing the statute of limitations, but fears a flurry of lawsuits and the financial hit a lookback window might deliver.But proponents of the legislation have said that hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t happened in states that have enacted similar legislation, and they call the window crucial. In addition to providing victims their day in court, they said the window serves a public-safety function by flushing out suspected abusers who are still in the community.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The lookback window will help identify abusers, many of whom still have contact with kids,‚<U+0080>ù said State Senator Brad Hoylman, Democrat of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill in the Senate. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>New York has among the worst laws in the country on child sexual abuse. We are an outlier, so this fix is a long time coming.‚<U+0080>ùThe billboards strategy was used by activists in London pushing for arrests in the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people last year, who last month deployed three roving billboards to ask why there had been no arrests in the tragedy.Ms. Sullivan said she was motivated by the frustration that Mr. Sargent has faced no major consequences.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is free to teach, free to coach, free to be elected onto boards,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are no blemishes on his record.‚<U+0080>ùEAST LANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The investigation began with the goal of uncovering how Michigan State University officials had failed to prevent Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar from assaulting hundreds of young women over decades. But the inquiry took a stunning turn on Tuesday when a university dean was accused not just of facilitating Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, but of committing sexual misconduct himself.Dr. William D. Strampel, who worked as Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss at the College of Osteopathic Medicine, was accused by investigators of grabbing the buttocks of two female medical students. He suggested that one young woman leave school and become a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>centerfold model,‚<U+0080>ù investigators said. And he stored nude ‚<U+0080><U+009C>selfies,‚<U+0080>ù apparently of Michigan State students, on his work computer, court documents say, along with a video of Dr. Nassar performing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treatment‚<U+0080>ù on a young patient.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As dean of the college, Strampel used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition and sexually assault female students,‚<U+0080>ù a detective from Michigan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statewide police agency wrote in an affidavit.The arrest of Dr. Strampel, who is 70 and was for 15 years the highest-ranking official at the osteopathic college, compounded the crisis facing Michigan State. It has seen its reputation devastated in recent months as scores of women recounted abuse by Dr. Nassar, a longtime university sports doctor. Women have described a corrupt culture at the university that diminished or ignored the complaints some of them made about Dr. Nassar as far back as the late 1990s. Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, Lou Anna K. Simon, left under pressure in January and trustees have faced calls to resign, even as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigation into the university was expected to continue and additional charges were possible.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another blow to the university,‚<U+0080>ù Tom Leonard, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, said of the charges against Dr. Strampel. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an absolute disgrace.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Strampel ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who stepped down in December from his job as dean, where he made more than $383,000 annually, according to MLive, a local news outlet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was charged with misconduct of a public official, a felony, and three misdemeanors, including fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of willful neglect of duty. Dr. Strampel was jailed on Monday, and appeared in court via video on Tuesday afternoon wearing a gray sweatshirt, his hands cuffed in front of him. A personal recognizance bond was set at $25,000, and Dr. Strampel was ordered not to contact current or former students, and not to leave the state.John Dakmak, a lawyer for Dr. Strampel, said his client planned to fight the charges and denied all of the counts against him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone, any student or otherwise,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Dakmak said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors in exchange for any type of standing within the university or the medical school.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges against Dr. Strampel come as prosecutors pursue a sprawling investigation of the university, which began after Dr. Nassar, a longtime physician for Michigan State and for U.S.A. Gymnastics, admitted sexually abusing young women and was sentenced to prison in hearings that drew international attention. Dozens of women, including Olympic gymnasts, described assaults committed under the guise of medical care. At least 265 people have said they were abused by Dr. Nassar.Prosecutors said Dr. Strampel failed to take steps to protect patients from Dr. Nassar when allegations of abuse emerged. He neglected, the prosecutors said, to follow a set of protocols that would, for instance, have required Dr. Nassar to conduct exams only with other staff members present. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Despite his representation of his (and the college‚<U+0080><U+0099>s) intended response to the allegations against Nassar, Strampel did not actually enforce or monitor these protocols, nor did he alert other employees in the Sports Medicine Clinic about the existence of the protocols,‚<U+0080>ù the charging documents said.The police detective‚<U+0080><U+0099>s affidavit outlining the charges also described a series of disturbing interactions between Dr. Strampel and four female medical students, none of whom were named publicly. In several of the cases, the women said they had gone to meet with Dr. Strampel to discuss their academic work but that he had turned the conversation to other topics.One woman who said she had been summoned to Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office after falling asleep in class said that he told her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>turn around in a circle twice so that he could observe her body,‚<U+0080>ù and that he said that she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.‚<U+0080>ù When she was later called to a dinner honoring scholarship recipients at a club on Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s golf course, she said Dr. Strampel reached around and gripped her buttock as they posed for photos, according to the affidavit.Another student who had failed a medical school test said she was required to meet with Dr. Strampel, who asked her what her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Plan B‚<U+0080>ù was since ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she could not cut it in medical school.‚<U+0080>ù The student said Dr. Strampel told her he would do her a favor by letting her take the exam again, but that she would then be required to do anything for him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given the context,‚<U+0080>ù the affidavit said, the woman ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understood that she was being asked to do anything he wanted sexually in exchange for the favor.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, Dr. Nicole Eastman, who graduated from the school in 2010 and who said that she was interviewed by investigators in the case, said that Dr. Strampel made inappropriate sexual remarks, beginning soon after she started school in 2006.At one point, he told her, laughing and boasting, that it was easy to get women drunk, she said. Another time, she said, he grabbed her buttock at a crowded event, in full view of his wife, who was standing nearby.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I just remember how humiliating it was,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People knew about his behavior, and even if they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t inappropriately touched by him, they knew. And now we know that his behavior enabled Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Eastman said she told a Michigan State employee while she was in school about Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. The employee looked resigned, Dr. Eastman recalled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Everybody knows about his behavior and nothing ever changes,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like a defeated kind of tone. When I think back to that, it was like she felt powerless.‚<U+0080>ùThe charging documents said Dr. Strampel also made graphic sexual comments, solicited nude photos from at least one student, and stored dozens of pornographic images and videos on a computer in his office, including many images that appeared to be of Michigan State students.Rachael Denhollander, who said Dr. Nassar abused her, said Tuesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges reflected a systemic failure at Michigan State.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is shocking but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not shocking,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone like Larry doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get away with becoming the worst sexual abuser in history in plain sight if he were not surrounded by people who had no problem with his conduct and did not think it was a big deal.‚<U+0080>ùMichigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interim president, John Engler, last month took steps to start the process of revoking Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tenure. University officials did not answer questions Tuesday about the status of the revocation, and did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Engler.For years, university officials largely dismissed reports that Dr. Nassar had assaulted women, even though some women said they had reported abuse years ago to coaches, trainers or counselors.On Tuesday, State Senator Margaret O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien, a Republican, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>this university needs to own up to what it did.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just go away,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should know that by now.‚<U+0080>ùOn the campus of Michigan State, students said they were unsettled by the arrest of Dr. Strampel, who came to the College of Osteopathic Medicine in the 1990s after a career that included stints in the surgeon general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and several hospitals.The college enrolls more than 1,200 students and graduates about 300 physicians each year. Graduates earn a D.O. degree instead of the more common M.D., but are full-fledged doctors able to prescribe medication, perform surgeries and choose any specialty. Students also study the osteopathic techniques of manipulating the spine, muscles and bones to diagnose and treat patients.Dr. Strampel, who could face up to nine years in prison if convicted of all charges, arrived at his home outside Lansing after his court appearance on Tuesday afternoon. A woman who came to the door declined to comment.Aly Raisman, an Olympic gymnast who said Dr. Nassar abused her, wrote on Instagram that the charges against Dr. Strampel were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another painful example‚<U+0080>ù of how so much had been mishandled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clear that failing to investigate and understand how this abuse could go on for so long is just asking history to repeat itself,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Raisman, who called for a broader investigation ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that looks into everything, not just Nassar.‚<U+0080>ùAn American swimmer who competed in the 2012 Olympics has accused her former coach of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.The swimmer, Ariana Kukors, 28, said in a statement on Wednesday that the coach, Sean Hutchison, began sexually abusing her when she was 16 and had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>grooming‚<U+0080>ù her for three years before that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kukors said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement emailed by his lawyer, Mr. Hutchison, 46, said Thursday that the accusations were not true. He said that the two had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>committed relationship‚<U+0080>ù that began after she was of age and that they had lived together for more than a year after the 2012 Olympic Games.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to ‚<U+0080><U+0098>groom‚<U+0080><U+0099> her.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her younger sister also lived with us for several months and her mother was a regular visitor to our home,‚<U+0080>ù the statement added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that she would make these wild allegations all these years later.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawyer, Brad Meryhew, said Mr. Hutchison would not comment further.In response to Mr. Hutchison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, B. Robert Allard, one of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers, said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana was groomed and manipulated as a minor by her trusted swim coach. He sexually assaulted her starting when she was 16. This abusive relationship continued until the age of 24. I would hardly characterize this a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>committed relationship‚<U+0080><U+0099> in the sense of two consenting adults who freely and willingly engage in healthy relations. There is nothing healthy about childhood sexual abuse.‚<U+0080>ùThe United States Homeland Security Department is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>still in the very preliminary stages‚<U+0080>ù of an investigation into this case, Lori Haley, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an email on Thursday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But our top priority in all cases involving alleged online child exploitation is identifying any possible minor victims.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Kukors once held the world record for the 200-meter individual medley and has won medals at several international competitions. She competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.Mr. Hutchison has worked with several Olympic swimmers, including the medalists Margaret Hoelzer, Caroline Burckle and Kara Lynn Joyce. He was an assistant coach for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s swimming team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.He met Ms. Kukors when he was a coach at King Aquatic Club in Seattle, according to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement.In a statement on Thursday, Michael Brooks, the head coach at the club, said that news of the allegations ‚<U+0080><U+009C>broke our collective hearts.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana Kukors is part of the King Aquatic family and we only want the best for her,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Brooks said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our staff is meeting to review this devastating news. Sean Hutchison has stepped down as an executive with King and has had no direct interaction with our swimmers for a very long time.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Allard said that U.S.A. Swimming had been given notice in 2010 about the inappropriate coach-athlete relationship but had done nothing.U.S.A. Swimming, the organization that governs the sport in the United States, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became aware of a rumored relationship between Hutchison and then 21-year-old Ariana via a third-party‚<U+0080>ù in 2010. (The organization said Mr. Hutchison does not work for the organization, but he once had a coach membership and remains a nonathlete member.)U.S.A. Swimming said that it conducted an investigation into the rumor in 2010, but that Ms. Kukors and Mr. Hutchison both ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unequivocally denied the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship,‚<U+0080>ù and the case was closed.In light of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, the organization expressed support for her and other victims ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in their quest to break their silence and confront their horrific experiences.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, she realized that she had been abused only ‚<U+0080><U+009C>through recent therapy and after years of suppressing memories of the pain and suffering,‚<U+0080>ù and that she was coming forward with her story on the recommendation of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates.Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement follows on the heels of a dramatic sentencing hearing for Lawrence G. Nassar, a medical professional who was convicted of sexually abusing the young gymnasts, including Olympians, who were his patients. At least 265 girls and women have accused him of abuse, including while an F.B.I. inquiry into the allegations was underway.Uproar over the slow response to the allegations led the board of directors of U.S.A. Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the United States, to resign.The sexual misconduct allegations against the former Fox News host Bill O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly and the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the confidential settlements arising from those accusations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have prompted a provision in the  final tax bill that aims to stem the use of nondisclosure agreements.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, proposed the amendment last month. It says any settlement, payout or lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse could not be deducted as a business expense if such payments were subject to a nondisclosure agreement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think most Americans would be outraged to know that they are subsidizing sexual predators in the tax code,‚<U+0080>ù he said in an emailed statement.But the proposed changes may not deter some companies and businesses from seeking confidentiality.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a nudge, not a hammer,‚<U+0080>ù Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an expert in tax policy, said in a phone interview on Saturday.Publicly known sexual harassment settlements involving Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who is said to have used nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have totaled about $45 million, including a $32 million payout that he paid personally.Mr. Weinstein, whose abuse of women was exposed by The New York Times in October, also has used confidentiality agreements. The Times reported that Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment.Under the tax bill spearheaded by Republicans, a hypothetical company that paid a $10 million sexual abuse settlement would not be able to take a deduction on that amount if the payout had a nondisclosure agreement attached to it.In the absence of a confidentiality agreement, however, the new corporate tax rate would allow the company to save $2.1 million in taxes, making its out-of-pocket cost $7.9 million.For a business that generates billions in revenue, like the parent company of Fox News, a nondisclosure agreement can have far more value than tax savings.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new rules are very well-intentioned, but the impact is likely to only be symbolic,‚<U+0080>ù Gordon Klein, a lawyer, certified public accountant and faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Anderson School of Management, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The reason for that is companies cherish nondisclosure agreements because they significantly help protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and protect them from follow-on lawsuits or additional lawsuits.‚<U+0080>ùThe nonspecific language of the amendment also complicated matters, Mr. Klein said.The bill refers to settlements or payments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>related‚<U+0080>ù to sexual harassment or sexual abuse, he said, but what if only one portion of the allegations is about sexual harassment? And does it matter if the sexual harassment was merely an allegation, or does there need to be evidence of sexual harassment? Are the lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees limited to the time spent drafting the settlement, or to all of the fees associated with the settlement?Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, proposed a similar amendment for the House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tax reform bill but it did not include a stipulation about confidentiality agreements.In the end, the language in the Senate bill offered by Mr. Menendez made the final cut when lawmakers blended the two bills together. Democrats have heavily criticized the proposed tax bill and complained they were shut out of the legislative process.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the reason, in all honestly, why there was no pushback was because it was a revenue generator,‚<U+0080>ù Tricia Enright, Mr. Menendez‚<U+0080><U+0099>s press secretary, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They determined that it would be seen on the plus-side of the ledger.‚<U+0080>ùWhile the new tax plan would allow businesses to write off legal fees related to sexual harassment payouts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> provided they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not tied to nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it is a different situation for employees who make claims of sexual abuse or harassment.In those cases, plaintiffs will no longer be able to write off their legal fees. A plaintiff could ordinarily claim such an expense as an itemized deduction, but the Republican plan has eliminated that option, Mr. Hemel said, adding that it creates ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a one-sidedness.‚<U+0080>ùROME ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After his spirited defense of a Chilean bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse prompted the greatest crisis of his pontificate, Pope Francis reactivated an abuse commission on Saturday that had lapsed into dormancy.It was the latest in a series of measures by the Vatican to counter criticism that fighting abuse was not a priority for Francis‚<U+0080><U+0099> papacy.Cardinal Sean O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley of Boston was reappointed as the leader of the group, called the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. A Vatican statement said the panel would include some victims of clerical sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm,‚<U+0080>ù Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley said in a statement.The Vatican statement said the abuse victims on the commission preferred to keep their histories private.The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December, and its lapsing coincided with growing criticism of the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to addressing sexual abuse in the church. The group plans to begin its work in April by hearing the testimony of abuse victims.The Vatican statement said the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s goal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and greatest challenge‚<U+0080>ù remained embedding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>abuse prevention and protection into the life and action of local churches.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement about the commission came on the same day that the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most experienced sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, was expected to take testimony in New York from Juan Carlos Cruz, who says that he was sexually abused when he was a teenager in Chile by a priest and that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had witnessed the abuse.While visiting Chile last month, the pope initially defended Bishop Barros as a victim of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>calumny,‚<U+0080>ù saying that the Vatican had received no concrete evidence against the bishop.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,‚<U+0080>ù Francis said at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander.‚<U+0080>ùThe comments caused outrage in Chile, and Francis, amid intense pressure, dispatched Archbishop Scicluna to investigate.On Thursday, the Civilt√† Cattolica, a Jesuit journal, published the private remarks the pope made during a visit to Peru last month, in which he disclosed that he regularly met with victims of sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father meets victims of sexual abuse, either individually or in groups, several times a month,‚<U+0080>ù Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman, confirmed in a statement. He added that the pope ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tries to help them heal the grave wounds caused by the abuses they suffered.‚<U+0080>ùMany advocates for abuse survivors accused the pope of opening up a wound by saying there was no evidence that Bishop Barros had covered up abuse. It then emerged that the pope had personally received an eight-page letter in 2015 containing testimony against the bishop, and that Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley had delivered it.Eight members of the commission were reappointed, and nine others are new to the panel. Its experts, which include lay academics and psychologists, priests and nuns, come from several countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Tonga. Ten are non-clerics and eight are women, including three nuns.Two abuse survivors previously left the commission in frustration. And the pope did not reappoint six lay members who advocates for the abused considered among the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most active leaders.CHARLOTTE, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Back in court Wednesday for his third and final sentencing hearing, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports clinic doctor, heard statements from more than 20 accusers, many of whom shared accounts of sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar at a local gymnastics club known for grooming stars.Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers include elite athletes, such as the Olympic medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas. But the speakers in court on Wednesday were not global superstars. They were mostly regular teenagers who told of being charmed by Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strange laugh‚<U+0080>ù and by the autographed posters of revered gymnasts on the walls of his office at the Michigan State sports clinic.Twistars Gymnastics Club, outside Lansing, Mich., was supposed to catapult young female athletes to a fruitful career, under the guidance of John Geddert, who owned the gym and coached there. Instead it became a site of anguish and devastation, according to the statements, some of which described long-lasting injuries, both mental and physical, inflicted by the doctor known as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>healer of gymnasts.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, more than 150 young women and teenagers finished publicly confronting Dr. Nassar during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. He has received sentences of 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography and of 40 to 175 years for the sexual abuse charges in Ingham County.Starting Wednesday, 65 women were scheduled to speak here in Eaton County Circuit Court this week. The judge, Janice K. Cunningham, said that the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265, some of whom chose to remain anonymous.Unlike the Ingham County judge, Rosemarie E. Aquilina, whose frequent commentary throughout the hearing there was met with a mix of praise and disapproval, Judge Cunningham kept her comments concise and subdued, primarily expressing appreciation for the victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> bravery.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is almost beyond comprehension to listen to young women in high school to stand at that podium and come forward with their story,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Dr. Nassar, wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, remained stoic with his head hanging low throughout the first day of the hearing, which included statements from 29 of the accusers, 22 of whom had not previously offered a statement in Ingham County.The first speaker, Jessica Thomashow, said she had been assaulted by Dr. Nassar as early as age 9, at Twistars.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The way it worked at Twistars was that, if you were injured, you were specifically instructed to see Larry Nassar, not your family doctor,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Thomashow said. She recalled being excited to see the famed Dr. Nassar for a rib injury.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into the back room and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when everything changed,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to the room Dr. Nassar used at Twistars.Another victim, Bailey Lorencen, whose statement was read for her, referred to Twistars‚<U+0080><U+0099> back room as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dungeon.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is clear that in an environment like Twistars, a monster like Nassar would thrive,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lorencen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said.Dr. Nassar pleaded guilty here in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13, according to a plea agreement.The agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011, some of it under the guise of medical treatment. A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars.Dr. Nassar will be sentenced after the victims speak. The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the counts.The case has reverberated in the sports world, and it led to the resignation of the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board of directors.At Michigan State, the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president, after the longtime president Lou Anna Simon resigned last week. But Mr. Engler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appointment has already been met with student protests, and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faculty senate is debating a vote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no confidence‚<U+0080>ù in the board. The vote could come as soon as next week.The stories told Wednesday by the young women and by athletes‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents, some of whom had been in the room while Dr. Nassar abused their daughters, painted an image of a dark side in gymnastics culture. Many of the victims said the pressure to rise in the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ranks had contributed to their decisions not to report the abuse sooner.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I kept thinking, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a doctor, stop overreacting,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Katherine Ebert said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t overreacting.‚<U+0080>ùMadison Bonofiglio, whose statement was read by Angela Povilaitis, the assistant attorney general, said she had dismissed her feelings while she was being abused for fear of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>upsetting‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are judged by your body, your looks, your cuteness factor, and then your skill,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.The young women said that they were told they had no choice but to see Dr. Nassar and that he had lulled them into trusting him. He lit the fireplace to keep athletes warm when ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treating‚<U+0080>ù them in his basement, where the abuse often occurred, they said. Dr. Nassar often gave gifts, such as souvenir pins, necklaces and treats, according to some of the statements.Amy Preston, the mother of a 19-year-old who was abused by Dr. Nassar as a child, said he had brought the girl waffles with fresh berries and whipped cream. He often consoled gymnasts when Mr. Geddert screamed at them, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>John, you tried to teach our girls to be quiet and obey,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Preston said in court, apparently referring to Mr. Geddert. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We now stand before them and say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Speak.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A. sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University, formally opening an investigation into how the university handled the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, the doctor who sexually assaulted scores of female athletes.Dr. Nassar spent decades on the faculty at the university and treated its athletes, as well as members of the United States national gymnastics team.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has requested information from Michigan State about any potential rules violations,‚<U+0080>ù Donald M. Remy, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief legal officer, said in a phone interview Tuesday evening.N.C.A.A. bylaws require colleges to protect the health, safety and well-being of athletes. Among those who have said Dr. Nassar abused them are members of the Michigan State cross country and softball teams. Kathie Klages, the former gymnastics coach who retired last year, has been accused of seeking to cover up allegations against Dr. Nassar, who served as team physician for the university gymnastics and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crew programs.In a statement late Tuesday, the association said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential N.C.A.A. rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State. We will have no further comment at this time.‚<U+0080>ùA Michigan State spokesman said Tuesday night that the university was reviewing the letter before issuing a response.On Wednesday, Michigan State released the N.C.A.A‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter, which was addressed to Athletic Director Mark Hollis and copied to President Lou Anna Simon. Referring to Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>heinous and appalling assaults,‚<U+0080>ù it cited the principle of athlete wellbeing and a by-law that it said pertained to that principle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s heinous crimes of record against more than 150 victims raise serious concerns about institutional practices, student-athlete safety and the institution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions to protect individuals from his behavior.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement Wednesday, Hollis pledged a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>comprehensive response‚<U+0080>ù to the letter and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation. Of college athletes, he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety.‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A., the governing body of intercollegiate athletics, was widely criticized several years ago for its handling of a case involving Penn State University in which Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant football coach, sexually abused young boys. (Sandusky is serving a decades-long prison term.)Less than a year after the Penn State scandal became public in the fall of 2011, an independent investigation commissioned by Penn State, and led by Louis J. Freeh, helped lead to N.C.A.A. sanctions, including a $60 million fine and the vacating of more than 100 wins from the lifetime record of the former head coach Joe Paterno, who died earlier that year. Several of the penalties were later rescinded, and the wins restored.Critics contended that the N.C.A.A. had overstepped its bounds with those penalties. Emails made public because of a lawsuit two years later appeared to show N.C.A.A. officials questioning whether their institution had the authority to issue such penalties on a university, even one where several high-ranking officials later received jail time for their roles in covering up Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse.In one email, an N.C.A.A. official referred to the consent decree between the association and Penn State as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bluff‚<U+0080>ù and urged a settlement because the N.C.A.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chances of proving a violation of its bylaws before a Committee on Infractions might prove difficult.Last year, an N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions demonstrated just how narrow those bylaws can be when it declined to penalize the University of North Carolina over a scandal in which scores of dubious classes were taken disproportionally by football and men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basketball players. Through gritted teeth, the committee said it could not find an N.C.A.A. violation because the classes had been available to all students.The Nassar case has drawn comparisons to the Sandusky case, raising questions about how university officials responded to warning signs about federal crimes being committed on their campus and about whether they tried to protect someone who was considered valuable to the athletics program. The Michigan State University police received a report about Dr. Nassar as early as May 2014, and on Tuesday a former rower at Michigan State said she had received no response to two separate reports of abuse by Nassar.Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon, a former chair of what is now known as the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors, has faced calls for resignation, though the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s board has largely supported her.The Nassar case has been pushed further into the national spotlight over the past week as Judge Rosemarie Aquilina has allowed more than 140 women, and others connected to the case, to speak at a sentencing hearing for Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to multiple sex crimes and has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. On Monday, three leading members of the board of U.S.A. Gymnastics, which also employed Dr. Nassar for years, resigned amid increasing criticism of how they responded to reports of his abuse.Several voices ordinarily critical of the N.C.A.A. have urged the organization to stay away from the allegations against Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are always mindful of the voices around college athletics,‚<U+0080>ù Remy said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and we strive to do the right thing.‚<U+0080>ùAt the N.C.A.A. Convention last week in Indianapolis, Mark Emmert, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, conspicuously did not mention Michigan State in his annual address, even as he alluded to the U.N.C. scandal and the under-the-table payments in men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s college basketball that federal officials revealed last fall. Emmert told members of the news media at the convention that he did not have enough information on what happened at Michigan State to comment on it in-depth.However, in his address Emmert rebutted the notion that the N.C.A.A. should steer clear of controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dance around those things,‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to various scandals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t make excuses for it. We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say our process is slow.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do we respond? I think, first of all, by not retreating from it, not getting under our desks not hiding from it.‚<U+0080>ùLANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Armed with pieces of paper etched with their memories of sexual abuse, they stepped forward, one by one ‚<U+0080><U+0094> nearly 100 of them, with more to come.For four full days this week, in a fluorescent-lighted courtroom here, women and girls ‚<U+0080><U+0094> some of them the best gymnasts in the country, others with dreams prematurely crushed, they said, by a man who now sat in handcuffs 10 feet away ‚<U+0080><U+0094> leaned into a microphone to address him, sometimes through sobs, sometimes with screams, but always with determination.Aly Raisman, 23, who won gold medals at the past two Summer Olympics, told of late-night knocks on her hotel door while she was competing overseas, as the man, Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, then the team doctor, arrived to abuse her.A teammate at the 2012 London Games, Jordyn Wieber, who until Friday had not identified herself as a victim of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, recalled the torment of the Games, where she was a part of the American team that won a gold medal but, she said, had to submit to his care under the auspices of the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s governing body, U.S.A. Gymnastics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our bodies were all hanging by a thread in London,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Who was the doctor that U.S.A.G. sent? The doctor who was our abuser.‚<U+0080>ùFor other young athletes just striking out, there seemed little they could do but give in, buckling under the pressure of knowing so many stars had seemingly benefited from him. And so a young gymnast named Chelsea Zerfas, now 15, spoke of anguished probing, under the guise of treatment, face down on an exam room table when she was 13, feeling helpless to challenge a doctor at that age.The occasion of the hearing, to help a judge decide Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prospective sentence on state charges of nearly a dozen sexual assaults, appeared almost beside the point. He had been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on a child pornography conviction, and the judge in this state court hearing has said that Dr. Nassar, 54, who has pleaded guilty to several sexual-assault charges, can expect to spend the rest of his life in prison.But before then, she allowed so-called victim impact statements from the 140 girls and women whom prosecutors accuse Dr. Nassar of abusing, leading to days of wrenching testimony here that has evolved into not only a nationally televised reckoning of his crimes but an indictment of a sport that his victims say did little to protect them.At the same time, the hearing has dovetailed with the continued expansion of the #MeToo movement that seeks to hold predatory men to account ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in this case, in excruciating detail.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Come hell or high water, we will find a way to take every last one of you down that could have stopped this monster,‚<U+0080>ù said Amy Labadie, a former gymnast who testified Friday morning. She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to see into the future and not think this will affect me forever.‚<U+0080>ùSome of the victims described how the team doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions spawned suicidal thoughts and ruptured their families, how they hoped he would rot in prison, and how they desperately wanted the blame and repercussions to extend far beyond him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to the people and the organizations that turned a blind eye.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Imagine feeling like you have no power and no voice,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman said Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, you know what, Larry? I have both power and voice, and I am only just beginning to use them. All these brave women have power, and we will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: a life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault, and his sentencing hearing, which began Tuesday, is now expected to continue next week, as the number of women who have wanted to speak in court has grown, from 88 to 105 to 120, at last count ‚<U+0080><U+0094> emboldened by what has happened here this week. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she had cleared her docket.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are all superheroes,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said Friday morning after one of the victims, choking back tears, read her statement.Dr. Nassar entered the courtroom at 9:04 a.m. He wore a dark blue prison uniform. After he reached the witness box, where he has sat with a hangdog expression since the hearing began, he appeared to recognize that Ms. Raisman and Ms. Wieber were seated together in the front row. Dr. Nassar looked down and slowly shook his head.Ms. Wieber, 22, was the first person to testify on Friday ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but the 69th to have her statement heard since the proceedings began. Ms. Wieber said Dr. Nassar began treating her when she was 8. Like many of those who came before her, Ms. Wieber said that Dr. Nassar had manipulated her by bringing her food and coffee at pressure-cooker training camps where such luxuries were prohibited.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody was protecting us from being taken advantage of,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Wieber said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody was ever concerned whether or not we were being sexually abused.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman took clear aim at both U.S.A. Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee when she appeared in court on Friday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Neither U.S.A. Gymnastics nor the U.S.O.C. have reached out to express sympathy or even offer support,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not even to ask: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>How did this happen? What do you think we can do to help?‚<U+0080><U+0099> Why have I and others here, probably, not heard anything from the leadership at the U.S.O.C.? Why has the United States Olympic Committee been silent? Why isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the U.S.O.C. here right now?‚<U+0080>ùMark Jones, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said in a statement that it first became aware of the possibility that a physician with the gymnastics federation had been abusing athletes in 2015.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At that time, U.S.A. Gymnastics indicated that they were in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement agencies,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are heartbroken that this abuse occurred, proud of the brave victims that have come forward and grateful that our criminal justice system has ensured that Nassar will never be able to harm another young woman.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Mr. Jones said, the Olympic committee will continue to press for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>meaningful change‚<U+0080>ù in the gymnastics federation.The federation announced on Thursday that it would cut ties with Karolyi Ranch, a renowned training facility that was one of the places where Dr. Nassar molested the gymnasts.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The development camp taking place through Sunday is the last U.S.A. Gymnastics activity at the Ranch,‚<U+0080>ù the federation said in a statement on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Next week‚<U+0080><U+0099>s training camp for the U.S. women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team is canceled and the Acro World Team Trials scheduled for the first week in February has been relocated.‚<U+0080>ùKara Johnson, now a high school student, spoke about how she was taken to Dr. Nassar for back and hip treatment when she was a 13-year-old runner. Dr. Nassar, she said, placed her on a table on her stomach and then molested her. She described how he left the room, returned with a lubricant and repeated the abuse. He then smacked her on her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bare butt,‚<U+0080>ù called her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sweetie‚<U+0080>ù and told her that if she ever had her period when she came to see him, to be sure to let him know, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>How was I supposed to know at the age of 13 what was medically acceptable and what the boundaries were?‚<U+0080>ù she said.Her sister Madeline was also abused. Now 15, she told the court that as a 12-year-old gymnast, she was sent to Dr. Nassar for back treatment and underwent the same abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At only 12 years old, I had no idea that it was inappropriate, illegal and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she said.On Thursday, McKayla Maroney, 22, another Olympic gymnast, said she had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>scars‚<U+0080>ù that might never heal after being abused by Dr. Nassar, starting when she was 13 or 14.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dr. Nassar was not a doctor,‚<U+0080>ù she said in a statement read for her by a prosecutor. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. End of story.‚<U+0080>ùThe impact of the trial, and Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history of assault, is spreading well beyond the courtroom. Michigan State University, which employed Dr. Nassar, was also facing increasing pressure after revelations that 14 people, including the president, Lou Anna K. Simon, had been warned about his conduct.Ms. Raisman added that she had not been planning to speak in court ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was scared and nervous,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but decided to add her name to the list once she began listening to the impact statements that were delivered earlier this week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My dream,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is that one day everyone will know what the words ‚<U+0080><U+0098>me, too‚<U+0080><U+0099> signify, but they will be educated and able to protect themselves from predators like Larry so that they will never, ever, ever have to say the words, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>me, too.‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ùThe room filled with applause as Ms. Raisman thanked the judge and backed away from the microphone. More women were waiting their turn.Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s third-highest-ranking official, arrived at a Melbourne court on Monday for the start of several weeks of hearings to determine whether he will face trial on charges of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ùPolice officers lined the sidewalk, as a large contingent of the local and international journalists and members of the public watched the cardinal enter the Melbourne Magistrates‚<U+0080><U+0099> Court.The slow-moving case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> charges were filed in June ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will be a test of both Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s justice system and the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to hold clerics accountable after decades of abuse scandals. Witness testimony began on Monday and is expected to continue for two weeks, during which time the court will be closed to the news media and the public.Here is a guide to what we know, what we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and how the case will be shaped by Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s court system.The son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Melbourne Response,‚<U+0080>ù a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell appeared in court on Monday wearing a black suit and clerical collar and did not speak during the initial session.Read:  How Cardinal Pell Rose to Power, Trailed by a Cloud of ScandalRead:  George Pell, Aide to Pope, Is Put on Defensive in Abuse InquiryCardinal Pell has been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ù No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and ‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses. However, nothing has been made public about the details ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not the number of accusers, not the time frame of the accusations, nor the severity of the acts at the center of the case.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said at a news conference in Rome last June.During Monday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hearing, the prosecution requested amendments to certain charges and requested that emotional support dogs be available to witnesses who testified via video link.Read: Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual AssaultRead: Vatican Sex Abuse Scandal Reveals Blind Spot for Francis Expected to run for four weeks, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committal hearing will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to trial.All relevant evidence will be presented to the magistrate by the prosecution, including witness testimony.Local news outlets have reported that up to 50 witnesses could be called during the hearing process. The court heard last year that some of the witnesses were choir boys at the time of the alleged incidents.All witnesses can be subject to cross-examination by the defense ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a noteworthy detail because Robert Richter, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, has a reputation for a withering and aggressive approach.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to demonstrate that what was alleged was impossible,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Richter told the court last October.Even if the magistrate decides that there is not sufficient evidence to proceed, Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.The hearing‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proceedings are largely conducted outside of public view. Reporters are being granted access for the first day of the hearing but will not be allowed to return to cover actual testimony.Read:  Cardinal George Pell Returns to Australia, Charged With Sexual OffensesAustralian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.The country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s contempt standards prohibit reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after charges have been filed and before a verdict has been reached ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that might be seen as prejudicial against or for a defendant.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information on a wide range of topics including: specific accusations against an individual, prior convictions and affiliations with convicted criminals, and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case.All news media organizations in Australia are subject to this restriction, which has the potential to create vast differences in articles about the case published from inside or outside Australia.Suppression orders are also used in many cases to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even the existence of a suppression order can be banned from publication, meaning that journalists cannot report precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage. These are sometimes referred to as superinjunctions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quite often, orders will be made to protect the fairness of the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial,‚<U+0080>ù said Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, whose research has focused on court proceedings. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the main purpose of an order.‚<U+0080>ùBut, he added, such orders are often approved without rigorous scrutiny about whether they are in fact necessary.In a report published before Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case began, Mr. Bosland wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Open justice is increasingly being undermined in Victoria due to the inappropriate use of suppression orders by the courts.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem in Australia is that the courts tend to make orders that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t comply with the strict requirements of the law.‚<U+0080>ùRead:  Suppression Orders Vs. Open JusticeCORYDON, Ind. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A southern Indiana elementary school teacher faces three dozen counts of child molestation that occurred over a three-year period, authorities said Monday.A not-guilty plea was entered on behalf of Corey Faith, 40, during an initial hearing in Harrison Superior Court. The Corydon man was being held at the Harrison County Jail on a $250,000 cash-only bond.Faith admitted the incidents of molestation occurred from 2005 to 2007 in his home, his classroom at New Middletown Elementary School in Corydon and elsewhere, Harrison County Prosecutor Otto Schalk said.A probable cause affidavit said the alleged victim was 12 years old when the molestations began. She had been a student of Faith's when he taught sixth grade. He most recently taught third grade.Court records said the investigation began March 19 when the Harrison County Sheriff's Department received a tip from a friend of the alleged victim after she spoke of multiple sexual encounters with Faith when she was under 14 years old.The South Harrison Community School Corp. delivered notice Monday of its intent to fire Faith. It issued a statement saying it was ""deeply saddened to learn of the events and critical lapses"" in judgment by Faith that occurred.Online court records didn't list an attorney for Faith.The team doctor accused of molesting scores of young athletes while working with the United States gymnastics team and Michigan State University pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault on Wednesday in Ingham County (Mich.) Circuit Court. He is expected to face at least 25 years in prison.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, 54, was charged with the molestation of seven girls, most of whom were gymnasts, but he has been accused of various levels of inappropriate or abusive sexual behavior by a group of more than 130 women and girls, including the Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas.Sentencing is set for Jan. 12. The victims will have an opportunity to speak.In a brief statement on Wednesday, Dr. Nassar said he made the plea ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to move the community forward and stop the hurting.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I pray every day for forgiveness,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You used your position of trust in the most vile way: to abuse children. I agree that now is a time of healing, but it may take them a lifetime of healing while you spend your life behind bars thinking of what you did by taking away their childhood.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The agreement which was placed on the record today was reached after extensive negotiations with the prosecution and with significant input from Larry Nassar. This agreement resolves all the charged and uncharged conduct for more than 125 cases currently under investigation by the Michigan Attorney General‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office.‚<U+0080>ùDuring the hearing Ms. Raisman sent out a Twitter message describing Dr. Nassar as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>monster.‚<U+0080>ùThe girls involved in this specific plea agreement testified that Dr. Nassar molested them, sometimes with their parents present, while they were seeking treatment for sports-related injuries. Complaints against Dr. Nassar reportedly go back 20 years, but USA gymnastics fired him in 2015, which is when the organization claims to have been made aware of the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He convinced these girls that this was some type of legitimate treatment,‚<U+0080>ù Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis told a judge last summer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why would they question him? Why would they question this gymnastics god?‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman, who was the captain of the teams that took home gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, has been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most vocal public critics, and has fiercely argued that the victims of the case should be blameless, despite some criticism they have received for waiting extended periods of time before reporting the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù she said in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes‚<U+0080>ù this month. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùAfter Ms. Raisman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement, and her subsequent commentary, Ms. Douglas, who had competed alongside her in both Olympics, posted a tweet that quoted a message from Ms. Raisman about the abuse. Ms. Douglas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s post included her own comment, which read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>however it is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd.‚<U+0080>ùThe comment was widely attacked as victim shaming, with Simone Biles, the 2016 all-around gold medalist, showing her disappointment in a post to Twitter in which she said it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shocks me that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m seeing this but it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t surprise me.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Douglas has attempted to walk back the post, saying it was misinterpreted and that victims are always blameless. In her clarifications she revealed that she, too, had been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.Ms. Maroney was the first of the gold medal-winning gymnasts to publicly accuse Dr. Nassar when she revealed details of her abuse in October, and Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist from the 2000 team, was among the initial group of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers last year.While Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal situation appears to be resolved in Ingham County, he faces similar charges in Eaton County, the location of an elite gymnastics club. He is also awaiting sentencing after having pleaded guilty in federal court on child pornography charges.On a flight from Seattle to San Jose, Calif., on Monday, a woman caught a glimpse of some text messages that alarmed her.A man seated in front of her on the Southwest Airlines flight was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>texting about sexually molesting young children,‚<U+0080>ù  the San Jose Police Department said in a news release.The man, identified by police as Michael Kellar, 56, of Tacoma, Wash., was using a large smartphone with enlarged text, making it easier for her to read his messages and take photographs of them.The woman alerted a member of the flight crew, who notified police officers working in the Mineta San Jose International Airport. Mr. Kellar was arrested after the plane landed.The woman is a preschool teacher, said Detective Sgt. Brian Spears, commander of the San Jose Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely a hero in our eyes,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Kellar was charged with attempted child molestation and solicitation of a sex crime, both felonies. He was arraigned on Thursday and was being held without bail at the Santa Clara County Jail.Police named Gail Burnworth, 50, also a resident of Tacoma, as the person Mr. Kellar was suspected of texting. They have also located two children, ages 5 and 7, who may have been victims of sexual abuse.Sergeant Spears said the text messages ‚<U+0080><U+009C>described specific sex acts performed on children, as well as bestiality.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It definitely goes beyond just that flight,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a history of conversations between them.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to a statement from the city of Seattle on Wednesday, it seems that Ms. Burnworth ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had access to the children either as a caregiver or babysitter.‚<U+0080>ù She was arrested in Tacoma on Monday but was released after prosecutors did not formally charge her within 72 hours.She was arrested again on Friday night on a federal warrant for conspiracy to produce child pornography.Southwest Airlines did not provide access to the crew member who alerted police because of the criminal investigation. In an emailed statement, it said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We always encourage customers to say something to our employees or law enforcement if they see something suspicious.‚<U+0080>ùThe authorities in California and Washington said federal charges are likely, and the F.B.I. was involved in the continuing investigation.Capt. Mike Edwards, commander of the Seattle Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said the two children who may have been victims remained at their home with their parents.Police did not identify the teacher who reported the text messages. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re very grateful that she was on that plane,‚<U+0080>ù Captain Edwards said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the big message and the big takeaway on this is, for all of us, is to pay attention to what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going on around you,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You never know how important it could be.‚<U+0080>ùHARRISBURG, Pa. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A judge on Friday sentenced three former Pennsylvania State University officials, including a former president, to short jail terms followed by home confinement for their roles in the child molestation scandal that rocked the university.In March, a jury found Graham B. Spanier, the former president, guilty of one misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a child, and not guilty of two other charges. His lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction, and they argued for a sentence of probation rather than jail time.The officials were charged for failing to go to law enforcement after being told in 2001 that a former assistant football coach, Jerry Sandusky, had been seen molesting a boy in a locker room shower. The officials denied that they were told at the time that the episode in the shower was overtly sexual.Mr. Sandusky went on to assault several other minors, and in 2012, he was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.It is very rare for prosecutors to try to hold university leaders criminally liable for the misconduct of others, and the case is all the more remarkable for involving one of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most prominent universities, and one of its most vaunted football programs.It has been a stunning downfall for Mr. Spanier, 68, who had spoken publicly about his own history of being abused as a child by his father, who beat him severely. He served for 16 years as president of Penn State, until he was forced out in 2011, and had earned a reputation as a skilled, energetic administrator who sometimes went too far in stifling criticism of the university.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The single most important thing I can say is that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080>ù he told the court on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that I did not intervene far more carefully.‚<U+0080>ùIn handing down the sentence in Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, Judge John Boccabella said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a Shakespearean tragedy; this is a fall from grace that is both unfortunate and well deserved.‚<U+0080>ùThe defendants are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good people who made a terrible mistake,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why no one made a phone call to police is beyond me.‚<U+0080>ùLaura Ditka, the deputy state attorney general who was the lead prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Spanier had chosen to protect his and Penn State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputations, rather than protect children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is inexcusable,‚<U+0080>ù she said.The case also badly damaged the reputation of Joe Paterno, the revered head football coach, who was accused of knowing about allegations against Mr. Sandusky. He was fired in 2011, after 45 years, and died a few months later.The university has paid tens of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits filed by Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, and the total could eventually exceed $100 million. Mr. Spanier has also sued the university.Gary Schultz, formerly a senior vice president of the university, and Tim Curley, a former athletic director, were charged along with Mr. Spanier. They pleaded guilty to related charges and testified at the trial of Mr. Spanier, who refused a plea deal.Mr. Spanier‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers had argued that he should not get jail time, in part because of health problems. Prosecutors said he should receive a penalty in the upper part of the allowable range for the conviction, which carries a maximum sentence of one year.Judge Boccabella sentenced Mr. Spanier to four to 12 months‚<U+0080><U+0099> confinement, with at least two months of that in jail followed by home confinement, and a $7,500 fine. He sentenced Mr. Curley to seven to 23 months, with at least three months in jail, and a $5,000 fine; and Mr. Schultz to six to 23 months, with at least two months in jail, and a $5,000 fine. In addition, he imposed two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> probation on all three men.The judge said he was not convinced that Mr. Spanier was as culpable as the other two.Mr. Spanier, who arrived at the courthouse holding hands with his wife, Sandra, remained impassive throughout, and he and his lawyers declined to answer questions as they left. But Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz made emotional appeals for leniency before the sentences were handed down.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sickens me to think that I might have played a part in children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s suffering,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schultz said.A founder of the now-disbanded Minuteman border patrol group has been convicted in Arizona of molesting a 5-year-old girl, bringing to an end a case that gained the attention of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s highest court after he tried to cross-examine the young victim.The defendant, Christopher Simcox, 55, was found guilty Wednesday of molesting the girl, who was a friend of his 6-year-old daughter, between April 21, 2012, and May 23, 2013, during visits to his apartment,  the Maricopa County attorney, Bill Montgomery, said in a statement. Mr. Simcox was in the process of divorcing his wife at the time.The girl told her mother of the abuse, and her mother called law enforcement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The defendant preyed upon a young child while she was meant to be in his care,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This young girl had the courage to come forward to stop the abuse and by doing so revealed his predatory behavior. With this verdict, we have been able to seek justice for this victim.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Simcox was found guilty of two counts of molestation of a child and one count of furnishing obscene materials to a minor, the statement said. He was also accused of sexual conduct with another child, but was found not guilty of that charge, Mr. Montgomery said.Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial took an unexpected turn that could have an impact on future case law. Although he is not a lawyer, Mr. Simcox represented himself and sought to question the girls he was accused of molesting.But prosecutors brought in an expert to address the trauma it would cause the victims, and they took action in lower courts to block Mr. Simcox, eventually filing a petition that is now before the United States Supreme Court.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ultimately, the defendant backed down from his insistence on personally carrying out the cross-examination of his victims and allowed his advisory attorney to question the victims,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though the issue is now moot in this case, it is still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court because of its legal significance.‚<U+0080>ùKerrie Droban, who served as Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advisory counsel, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that she had questioned the girls instead, while Mr. Simcox was allowed during the trial to question two children who were witnesses.Mr. Simcox will be sentenced on July 5. Consecutive mandatory sentences could be tantamount to a life in prison, Ms. Droban said.Mr. Simcox was a former high-profile advocate for tougher control of borders and undocumented day laborers, joining watch groups and speaking out at public events, like one in Farmingville on Long Island in 2003.He was a founder of a volunteer armed watch group, Civil Homeland Defense, which was created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and intercepted undocumented immigrants crossing into Arizona, turning them over to the authorities. Later, he helped form the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, which stepped into the national spotlight in 2005 with high-profile border patrols.The Southern Poverty Law Center said Mr. Simcox, a former kindergarten teacher, was among the movement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most charismatic figures, affecting the likeness of a vigilante with a pistol tucked into the front of his jeans.In 2012, Mr. Simcox told the center, which was investigating the possible involvement of extremist groups in the killings of Mexicans crossing the Arizona border, that he had left the movement and was living a quiet life tutoring schoolchildren in suburban Phoenix.When the verdict in his trial was announced on Wednesday, the mother of the then-5-year-old girl dabbed her eyes with tissue, The Arizona Republic reported.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was convicted on at least one, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s all we need,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This conviction is for all of the children that he hurt.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have words,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s over. I can go home and tell my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùHARRISBURG, Pa. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The agency that investigates and prosecutes wrongdoing by Pennsylvania lawyers wants the state Supreme Court to punish Penn State's former general counsel and a prosecutor who helped convict Jerry Sandusky of child molestation related to their involvement with the 2012 grand jury investigation.The state Office of Disciplinary Counsel has lodged petitions for discipline against Cynthia Baldwin, a former state Supreme Court justice who was the university's general counsel when the scandal broke, and Frank Fina, who helped direct the investigation and lead the prosecution of Sandusky by the attorney general's office.The allegations against the two recently became public. Baldwin has a hearing scheduled for May.Fina is accused of turning Baldwin ""into a witness for the prosecution"" when Baldwin testified in secret in October 2012 about three former high-ranking university administrators who fielded complaints about Sandusky abusing children ‚<U+0080><U+0094> president Graham Spanier, vice president Gary Schultz and athletic director Tim Curley.Disciplinary Counsel Amelia C. Kittredge wrote in the 41-page petition for discipline filed in January that Fina's questioning ""went far beyond, and impermissibly beyond, the topics (he) told Judge (Barry) Feudale he would cover.""Days after Baldwin's testimony, prosecutors added conspiracy to commit perjury and conspiracy to commit obstruction charges against Curley and Schultz and for the first time charged Spanier, accusing him of the same offenses. Superior Court in January 2016 threw out charges against all three men that related to false statements to the grand jury, saying Fina had misled the judge and calling his questioning of Baldwin ""highly improper.""Fina's lawyers call the claims against their client ""unprecedented and disturbing,"" and said sealed records from the criminal case ""fully exonerate"" him. Fina, now a lawyer in private practice, denies violating any rule of conduct and wants the petition dismissed.Curley and Schultz pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment on the eve of trial in March 2017 and testified against Spanier. Spanier was convicted of the same offense and has an appeal pending in Superior Court. Lawyers for all three men declined to comment on the lawyer discipline allegations against Fina and Baldwin.Superior Court, in throwing out charges, said it was improper that Baldwin, a former trial judge and onetime chair of the Penn State board, testified about her conversations with Curley, Schultz and Spanier.Joe Grace, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said it questioned Baldwin ""with the knowledge and approval of the judge assigned to supervise the grand jury.""""The matter was also addressed by the judge assigned to the criminal case, who rejected any claims of impropriety,"" he added. ""The Office of Attorney General remains fully prepared to defend its successful prosecutions and convictions in this matter.""The petition filed against Baldwin on Nov. 21 accuses her of violating requirements that lawyers do not disclose information about clients without their informed consent and other allegations.Baldwin had accompanied Curley, Schultz and Spanier when they appeared before the grand jury in 2011, months before child sexual abuse charges were filed against Sandusky and cover-up charges were filed against Curley and Schultz. In her answer to the petition for discipline, she said she thought they were witnesses only, not suspected of a crime, and that she represented the university.She denies violating the state's ethical rules for lawyers and has asked that the allegations be dismissed.""The allegations against Ms. Baldwin are based upon the conduct of Mr. Curley, Mr. Schultz and Dr. Spanier, who participated in a conspiracy to cover up their knowledge of Mr. Sandusky's conduct and who tried to blame Ms. Baldwin when their conspiracy came to light,"" wrote her lawyer, Robert S. Tintner. He said the original complaint about her to the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court was filed in June 2012, at the time of Sandusky's trial.Tintner said the sealed documents show she ""acted in a manner consistent with her ethical obligations.""Sandusky, Penn State's former assistant football coach, was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence. Al Lindsay, Sandusky's appellate defense attorney said the disciplinary board cases will not directly affect Sandusky's effort to get a new trial, but Lindsay believes the grand jury investigation was badly flawed and welcomes any effort to review how it unfolded.For more than a year, an F.B.I. inquiry into allegations that Lawrence G. Nassar, a respected sports doctor, had molested three elite teenage gymnasts followed a plodding pace as it moved back and forth among agents in three cities. The accumulating information included instructional videos of the doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unusual treatment methods, showing his ungloved hands working about the private areas of girls lying facedown on tables.But as the inquiry moved with little evident urgency, a cost was being paid. The New York Times has identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he first fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by an Indianapolis Star investigation. Some are among the youngest of the now-convicted predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s many accusers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 265, and counting.The three alleged victims then at the center of the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inquiry were world-class athletes; two were Olympic gold medalists. Nearly a year passed before agents interviewed two of the young women.The silence at times drove the victims and their families to distraction, including Gina Nichols, the mother of the gymnast initially known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Athlete A‚<U+0080>ù: Maggie Nichols, who was not contacted by the F.B.I. for nearly 11 months after the information she provided sparked the federal inquiry.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never got a phone call from the police or the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ù during that time, Gina Nichols, a registered nurse, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not one person. Not one. Not one. Not one.‚<U+0080>ùThe F.B.I. declined to answer detailed questions about the speed and nature of its investigation, or to provide an official who might put the case in context. Instead, it issued a 112-word statement asserting that the sexual exploitation of children ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is an especially heinous crime,‚<U+0080>ù and that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the safety and well-being of our youth is a top priority for the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also said that the many allegations against Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+009C>transcended jurisdictions‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an apparent suggestion that internal efforts to coordinate among its bureaus and with other law enforcement agencies partly explained the inquiry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s slow tempo.The agency left unaddressed the oft-repeated claim by U.S.A. Gymnastics officials that after initially presenting the sexual assault allegations to the F.B.I. in July 2015, they came away with the impression that federal agents had advised them not to discuss the case with anyone. The ensuing silence had dire consequences, as the many girls and young women still seeing Dr. Nassar received no warning.Among them was Emma Ann Miller.By the summer of 2015, Emma Ann, the only child of a single mother, was both a competitive dancer and just another Michigan kid immersed in the joys and dramas of middle school life. She got braces, with baby blue rubber bands that matched her eyes. She began receiving Snapchat attention from boys.And once a month, she went to Suite 420 in a six-story office building close to Michigan State University in East Lansing, where her solicitous doctor, who encouraged everyone to just call him Larry, molested her.According to her lawyer, Emma Ann had about a dozen sessions with Dr. Nassar between the summers of 2015 and 2016. The pain of the procedures increased, and her self-confidence plummeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whenever he asked if my lower back hurt, he would always find a way to touch me down there,‚<U+0080>ù she said, explaining that Dr. Nassar would say that her pelvis was in need of adjustment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whether or not I said my back hurt, he would always find a way to, to. ‚<U+0080>¶‚<U+0080>ùThe young girl paused.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve blocked out a lot of what he did to me,‚<U+0080>ù she said finally.Only three years ago, Dr. Nassar was a popular doctor among the athletes he treated for U.S.A. Gymnastics, known for being goofy but maybe a bit too attentive. His treatments, which gymnastics officials believed were at the cutting edge, were also in demand at Michigan State, where he worked, as well as at Holt High School, and at a gymnastics academy called Twistars.Issues had cropped up: a parent raising concerns about his behavior at Twistars; a female athlete or two at Michigan State complaining to no avail about inappropriate exams. In 2014, a university investigation of another complaint cleared Dr. Nassar of misconduct, but he was now required to have a third person present when treatment involved sensitive areas of the body ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and to wear gloves.Still, the doctor was trusted enough to conduct his procedures ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intravaginal adjustment‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> without supervision when treating the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s best gymnasts at the Karolyi ranch, the exclusive and secluded national team training camp, about 60 miles north of Houston. Gymnasts of international caliber, like Ms. Nichols, of suburban Minneapolis, would spend a week each month at the ranch, under the exacting supervision of the revered coach Martha Karolyi.But at the ranch in late spring of 2015, Ms. Nichols‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal coach, Sarah Jantzi, overheard the 17-year-old girl talking with another elite gymnast, Aly Raisman, about Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s invasive and inappropriate techniques. The alarming information was quickly shared with the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents and, by June 17, with officials at U.S.A. Gymnastics.Gina Nichols, Maggie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, recalled telling Steve Penny, then the president of U.S.A. Gymnastics, that the police had to be called immediately. But he insisted that she not tell anyone, she said. The organization would take care of alerting law enforcement.Weeks of silence passed, Gina Nichols said, interrupted occasionally by admonitions from Mr. Penny to keep quiet about the matter ‚<U+0080><U+0094> although the United States Olympic Committee has said that U.S.A. Gymnastics reported that one of its physicians had been accused of abusing athletes ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and was in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement authorities.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics eventually retained what it called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an experienced female investigator‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a specialist in workplace harassment. After completing her interviews, the investigator recommended on Friday, July 24, that Dr. Nassar be reported to law enforcement.Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman competed the next day at the U.S. Classic in Chicago. Gina Nichols said that she saw Mr. Penny at the event and that he told her: We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re working on this. Keep it quiet.On Monday, July 27, gymnastics officials contacted the F.B.I. in Indianapolis, where U.S.A. Gymnastics has its headquarters. The next day, its chairman, Paul Parilla, and its president, Mr. Penny, met with F.B.I. agents who, they later said, assured them they had come to the right place. Forty-one days had passed since U.S.A. Gymnastics first received the report of the sexual abuse of one of its charges.At this moment, F.B.I. agents in Indianapolis were also immersed in the child-exploitation case of Jared Fogle, the longtime pitchman on Subway television ads. Mr. Fogle was arrested that summer on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child and distribution of child pornography, and later sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison.The gymnastics officials provided the agents with contact information for three gymnasts: Ms. Nichols, Ms. Raisman and someone emerging as the central complainant: McKayla Maroney, then 19, a retired Olympic gold medalist who by the summer of 2015 had become a minor celebrity, struggling in public to find her next purpose in life ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a struggle she has since indicated was related to serious emotional issues stemming from the abuse.They also turned over copies of videos of Dr. Nassar demonstrating his technique as he chatted clinically about pulled hamstrings, buttocks and trigger points. Reporters for The New York Times have seen the videos, which show him kneading the legs of girls before his ungloved hands begin to work under a towel, between the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> legs.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not a fun place to dig,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar says to the camera.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do the hand-shaky thing,‚<U+0080>ù he adds later, demonstrating how he shakes his hand vigorously when it is deep between a girl‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legs.W. Jay Abbott, who at the time was the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. bureau in Indianapolis, said on Thursday that while he did not watch the videos, he vividly remembered the reactions of colleagues who had.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will never forget sitting around the table and thinking, What?‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Abbott, who retired in January. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the reaction of my special agents who were very well versed in this was one of disgust. That is why we worked it with such urgency.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At the time, it was being portrayed as a legitimate medical procedure. But to the layman, like ourselves, we were ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to be kidding me.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe next day, U.S.A. Gymnastics quietly, even surreptitiously, relieved Dr. Nassar of any further assignments. It later issued a statement saying: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>U.S.A. Gymnastics understood from its meeting with the F.B.I. that it should not take any action nor communicate anything that might interfere with the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation.‚<U+0080>ùAll the while, Dr. Nassar continued his uncommon treatment techniques on young patients.Emma Ann Miller remembers the summer of 2015 as her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>best summer ever.‚<U+0080>ùShe competed in a dance competition in Las Vegas, where she performed to a song from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Legally Blonde,‚<U+0080>ù and won a trophy that was two and a half feet tall ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about half her height. She spent time at a sleep-away Bible camp, where she went kayaking, horseback riding and zip-lining, and had water balloon fights.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We T.P.‚<U+0080><U+0099>ed the boys‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabin down the hill and had a Silly String fight with two of the other girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said with a laugh. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone threw a frog into one of the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins. It was so much fun.‚<U+0080>ùBut then there were those monthly visits to the office of Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+0094> doctor to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all of these super-high-up Olympians‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who had treated her mother for years for injuries related to a car accident. Given that Emma Ann had known him her entire life, he was almost like family, an intimacy reflected in the half-dozen photographs of her that he displayed in his treatment room.Dr. Nassar first molested her when she was 10, she recalled. She remembered the pants she was wearing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> black leggings with white flowers, from A√©ropostale. She was having back and neck issues, and he had her remove the leggings and put on loose shorts. In a medical supply room that doubled as a treatment room, he began exploring ‚<U+0080><U+009C>down there.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Is this O.K.?‚<U+0080><U+0099> and I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And he was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Just hang in there.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how it felt. I just knew that it hurt.‚<U+0080>ùIn the summer of 2015, the treatments hurt even more. She had tried wearing three pairs of underpants or especially tight shorts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> anything to keep Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fingers from probing her. Now that she was older, she began lying that she was having her period.At some point, Emma Ann told her mother that she preferred not to be alone with Dr. Nassar. That did not end it. She said he continued to abuse her while positioning himself so that her mother couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t see what he was doing. He would grope the girl beneath a white towel meant to convey propriety, all the while chatting with her mother, a kindergarten teacher.How‚<U+0080><U+0099>s your class going?‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew that he had helped my mom, so I had to persuade myself into thinking that he also helped me,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really sure.‚<U+0080>ùEmma Ann now knows that she was not alone. The growing number of other girls who say they were being molested between the summers of 2015 and 2016 includes Alexis Alvarado, 19, who began seeing Dr. Nassar in 2010 for a stress fracture in her back. He began that treatment by massaging her legs, but then his hands crept up until, she said, his fingers were inside her. She was 12.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize what he was doing was wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Alvarado said. But she explained that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thought everything could be fixed through the butt.‚<U+0080>ù That is why her gymnastics teammates in Lansing, Mich., called him the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>butt doctor.‚<U+0080>ùThe monthly appointments continued through the summer of 2015 and into the next year. So did her shame, and dread.The same was true for Hannah Morrow, of Naperville, Ill., who will turn 18 on Tuesday. Several times a year, starting when she was 11 or 12, she took the four-hour car ride to see Dr. Nassar, looping around the bottom coast of Lake Michigan. At some point, she started listening to playlists she compiled to help keep her mind off what was about to be done to her.She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d try to get hooked on a new song to sing in her head, over and over. Her favorite, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I Write Sins Not Tragedies‚<U+0080>ù by Panic! At the Disco, included the line: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.‚<U+0080>ùAs with Emma Ann Miller, Hannah also began wearing tighter pants and underwear that covered more of her buttocks, in the unrealized hope that it would dissuade him. She struggled to reconcile his outsize reputation with what he was doing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If all of those Olympians loved him, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Hannah remembered thinking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though I feel weird with what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s doing, I guess I shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d make excuses: He doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too close to my butt, or that he brushed over my boobs.‚<U+0080>ùIn late July or early August, F.B.I. agents asked Ms. Maroney to travel to Indianapolis from her home in California to discuss the allegation, according to her lawyer, John Manly, but she declined. It is unclear why an agent did not travel to see her in person. As a result, the first substantive interview of an alleged victim in a child-molestation case was conducted by telephone.Meanwhile, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman continued their gymnastics pursuits ‚<U+0080><U+0094> both competed at the P & G Championships in Indianapolis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but they still had received no word from any law enforcement official about the allegations now lodged with the F.B.I.Some of the delay appears to have been related to questions concerning federal-versus-state jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction within the F.B.I. itself. Although the Indianapolis bureau had received the information, the alleged sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar had taken place in Texas, at the Karolyi ranch, and in Michigan, where he lived and worked. And Ms. Maroney lived in California.According to Mr. Abbott, his agents in Indianapolis did not have the case for long. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we consulted with the U.S. attorney, we knew right away that we would not have venue,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was never really our case.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Abbott said that his agents conducted some interviews, but he declined to say with whom. He also said written reports were sent within weeks to F.B.I. offices in Michigan and Los Angeles.The retired agent emphasized how the sensitivities and difficulties of child-exploitation cases can contribute to the length of investigations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are dealing with victims who sometimes don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be interviewed,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is extremely delicate. And you also have the parents of minors who are sometimes not comfortable with interviews.‚<U+0080>ùAsked why federal law enforcement officials did not notify people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> other gymnasts, parents, coaches ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that a potential child molester was in their midst, Mr. Abbott said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s where things can get tricky.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a duty to warn those who might be harmed in the future,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But everyone is still trying to ascertain whether a crime has been committed. And everybody has rights here‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reference to both the alleged victims and the person being accused.The Nassar case might have been further complicated, he said, by the fact that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there was a vigorous debate going on about whether this was a legitimate medical procedure.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics officials said that around this time they were told that pertinent interviews had been completed and that the case had been transferred to another jurisdiction. Indeed, on Sept. 12, Ms. Maroney was directed by U.S.A. Gymnastics to contact the F.B.I. East Lansing office.According to Mr. Manly, the retired gymnast‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Erin Maroney, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>called repeatedly,‚<U+0080>ù but received no follow-up response.Two weeks later, on Sept. 27, Dr. Nassar announced on Facebook that he was retiring from the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team staff, notwithstanding a note he had posted in late June saying he would remain with the team through the summer of 2016.He did not elaborate.In April 2016, Ms. Raisman shared a gold medal with the national team at the Pacific Rim Championships in Seattle, while Ms. Nichols damaged a knee during training, underwent surgery, and was out for several weeks ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reminder of the physical toll of the sport. Meanwhile, neither she nor her parents heard anything about the federal investigation that U.S.A. Gymnastics had instructed them to remain silent about.The Raisman family was similarly frustrated. According to a person close to the family, Ms. Raisman and her mother, Lynn, repeatedly reached out to Mr. Penny to find out about the status of the federal investigation, only to be told that an F.B.I. agent would be getting in touch with them.Finally, the absence of information about the federal investigation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the increasing concern of the victims and their families ‚<U+0080><U+0094> prompted Mr. Penny and Mr. Parilla, the U.S.A. Gymnastics officials, to visit the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Los Angeles bureau in early May. Mr. Parilla lives in Southern California, as does Ms. Maroney, and Mr. Penny stopped in Los Angeles while returning from an overseas trip.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As time passed, concern about a perceived lack of development prompted Board Chair Paul Parilla and C.E.O. Steve Penny to report the matter a second time to a different F.B.I. office,‚<U+0080>ù U.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement to The Times on Friday.Through a lawyer and a spokeswoman, Mr. Parilla and Mr. Penny declined to be interviewed for this article.The visit appears to have jump-started the federal investigation into Dr. Nassar. Agents asked for more information, including a list of the members of the national women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics team. And on May 17, the F.B.I. finally interviewed Ms. Maroney in person.It had been 294 days since the F.B.I. was first notified of accusations against Dr. Nassar.A few weeks later, on June 13, Gina Nichols received an email from Michael Hess, an F.B.I. agent then based in Los Angeles. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am looking into a complaint that was filed involving alleged misconduct by an individual associated with U.S.A. Gymnastics,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When you have a moment, please give me a call at the below numbers.‚<U+0080>ùIt was a stressful time: Her daughter was preparing for the Olympic trials. But several days later, the gymnast went to a suburban Minneapolis building, not far from her home, to meet Mr. Hess, who had flown in from Los Angeles.In addition, a person close to the Raisman family said that the F.B.I. also contacted Ms. Raisman in the summer of 2016. While Mr. Manly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who represents Ms. Raisman, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Maroney ‚<U+0080><U+0094> applauded the diligence of Mr. Hess, he expressed amazement that so little had been done for so long.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given who these women were, all competing for their country, and given that these assaults had occurred in different states and countries, there was an obvious need to have a multilayered, multijurisdictional investigation,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Manly said.Gina Nichols, who had been instructed by U.S.A. Gymnastics not to talk about the matter, recalled that while venting in a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Hess, the agent told her:You can talk to anybody you want.That August, in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Raisman had an Olympics for the ages, demonstrating poise and leadership as she won three medals, including gold. But Ms. Nichols, returning from her knee injury, was ultimately not invited to join the Olympic team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even as an alternate.Meanwhile, Emma Ann Miller continued to keep her treatment appointments with Dr. Nassar. But the abuse had worsened, and she no longer felt like the bubbly teenager she had been only a year before. She stopped taking selfies because she felt ugly and fat. She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d cry if she received an A-minus on a paper or test, thinking it was evidence of her stupidity.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even want to order a drink at Starbucks because I was so scared I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d mess it up,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said.Her mother, Leslie Miller, struggles now with her rage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at what he did to my happy girl,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Miller said, in tears. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at all the people who could‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve stopped him earlier. My goal is to find every single one of them in the haystack ‚<U+0080><U+0094> expose them all, so this will never happen again.‚<U+0080>ùIt was only a matter of time.On Sept. 12, 2016, The Indianapolis Star published an in-depth investigation detailing allegations that Dr. Nassar had repeatedly molested two gymnasts when they were young. One woman had filed a criminal complaint with the police in Michigan. The other, initially described only as an Olympic medalist, had filed a lawsuit against the doctor and U.S.A. Gymnastics in California. Neither was involved in the F.B.I. inquiry.Suddenly, the Nassar case took on urgency. As other girls and women began calling the Michigan State University Police to file complaints, their numbers eventually growing into the dozens, their abuser did what he could to mask his behavior, including throwing hard drives containing more than 37,000 images and videos of child pornography into the trash for pickup in the morning.But trash pickup in his neighborhood was late that day, allowing a police officer to find the horrifying material while executing a search warrant on behalf of the university police.By the close of 2016, Dr. Nassar was in custody. By the close of 2017, he had been convicted of myriad state charges, as well as federal child pornography charges, based in large part on that state search warrant. Given that he has been sentenced to nearly two centuries in prison, Dr. Nassar will likely die there.In recent weeks, a communal catharsis has played out, as dozens and dozens of empowered victims or their proxies have confronted the doctor at sentencing hearings. The angry but resolute words of Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols have echoed in the courtrooms of Michigan.So, too, have the words of the lesser-known accusers, those girls and young women who report they were abused in the year after allegations were first presented to the F.B.I. in Indianapolis: the likes of Alexis Alvarado and Hannah Morrow ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and Emma Ann Miller, who in November turned 15.The American gymnast McKayla Maroney, an Olympic gold medalist, said she was sexually abused by the same team doctor who is already facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Maroney, 21, posted on Twitter early Wednesday morning that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13.Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven other individuals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 125 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and dozens of civil suits filed against him in Michigan are currently in mediation.In her Twitter post, Maroney said Nassar molested team members, including her, under the guise of treating them for medical conditions over several decades. Her claims matched the stories of other gymnasts and former teammates.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treated,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Maroney said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened in London before my team and I won the gold medal, and it happened before I won my silver.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old. I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treatment.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I thought I was going to die that night.‚<U+0080>ùJamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the gymnasts who have accused Nassar. Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward, and many have joined a lawsuit against USA Gymnastics.Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, declined a request to comment on Wednesday.Maroney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusation comes a day after another gold medalist, Tatiana Gutsu of Ukraine, accused a star gymnast of raping her when she was 15. Gutsu won the all-around title at the 1992 Barcelona Games as part of the Unified Team of former Soviet athletes.Maroney said she chose to speak out publicly because of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Me Too‚<U+0080>ù movement in which women post the phrase on social media to show that they, too, have been sexually assaulted or harassed.Maroney was part of the 2012 American gymnastics team that won a team gold medal. She also won an individual silver on her specialty, the vault.She drew extra attention that year for a look of disappointment she displayed on the medal stand after winning her silver. The picture became an internet meme, often labeled, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>McKayla is not impressed,‚<U+0080>ù and President Barack Obama and others emulated her expression.The American gymnast Aly Raisman said that she too had been sexually abused by the team doctor who is facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Ms. Raisman, 23, made the revelation in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes,‚<U+0080>ù excerpts from which were released Friday, and in a book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fierce,‚<U+0080>ù being released next week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am angry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m really upset because I care a lot, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman was captain of the teams that won gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics. Another member of the 2012 team, McKayla Maroney, said last month that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13. Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the other gymnasts who have accused Dr. Nassar.Dr. Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 100 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges.Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward.Dr. Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, said Friday that he did not have a comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman told ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, USA Gymnastics said it had adopted a new policy that requires the reporting of suspicions of sexual abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused, and we are very sorry that any athlete has been harmed during his or her gymnastics career.‚<U+0080>ùThe interview will air in full on Sunday on CBS.In addition to her team gold medals, Ms. Raisman won the 2012 gold medal in floor exercise, as well as two individual silver medals and one bronze in her Olympics career. She also won four world championships medals and numerous national titles.Though she was the oldest gymnast on both the 2012 and 2016 teams, she has spoken of continuing her career and going for the 2020 Games.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, a former team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics who has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing gymnasts under the guise of medical treatment, was sentenced on Thursday to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.The charges, which stemmed from more than 37,000 images of child pornography found on Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer, are separate from the 10 molestation counts on which sentences will be handed down in January. He pleaded guilty to the pornography charges over the summer, and to the molestation charges in November.Dr. Nassar, 54, is expected to be sentenced to 25 years or more on the molestation charges. But even without that, he is virtually certain to spend the rest of his life in prison after Janet T. Neff, a federal district judge in Grand Rapids, Mich., imposed three consecutive 20-year sentences in the child pornography case.Matthew Newburg, a lawyer for Dr. Nassar, declined to comment on Thursday.The case against Dr. Nassar emerged last year, after an Indianapolis Star investigation found that U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national governing body, had systematically failed to report gymnasts‚<U+0080><U+0099> allegations of sexual abuse by coaches. Then, in September 2016, The Star published detailed accounts from two former gymnasts who said that, among other sexually abusive behavior, Dr. Nassar had penetrated them with his fingers, claiming it was a treatment for back pain.Those two gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Rachael Denhollander, who was the first to step forward by name, and Jamie Dantzscher, who initially remained anonymous but later spoke out publicly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> broke a dam of silence in the sport, more than a year before the #MeToo movement began revealing sexual misconduct by innumerable men in powerful positions. More than 130 women ‚<U+0080><U+0094> mostly but not exclusively gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have now described abuse by Dr. Nassar (who worked both for the national team and for Michigan State University). Among them are at least seven former members of the United States national gymnastics team, including four Olympians.Many of the women submitted victim impact statements to the court before the sentencing on Thursday. Judge Neff ruled last week that they could not be read aloud in the courtroom, but some women shared their statements through other channels.McKayla Maroney, a 2012 Olympian who came forward in October as one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, wrote in her statement that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He abused my trust, abused my body and left scars on my psyche that may never heal,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Maroney wrote, according to ESPN.And Aly Raisman ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the captain of the American women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics teams at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and one of the most outspoken survivors of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> published thousands of words in The Players‚<U+0080><U+0099> Tribune on Thursday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I ask that you give Larry the strongest possible sentence (which his actions deserve), for by doing so, you will send a message to him and to other abusers that they cannot get away with their horrible crimes,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman, 23, said in her statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe knowing that Larry is being held accountable for his abuse will help me and the other survivors feel less alone, like we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re being heard, and open up pathways for healing.‚<U+0080>ùBecause of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, Ms. Raisman wrote, she is frequently afraid: afraid that other doctors will treat her similarly; afraid even that a man will deliver her room service order when she travels.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hold the door open as he drops off the food and keep it open until he leaves,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I often wonder if I am hurting their feelings by being so obviously distrusting of them. I always used to give people the benefit of the doubt, but if a decorated doctor who served on the national team for over 30 years turned out to be a monster, then how can I trust anybody?‚<U+0080>ùEven so, she continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am not a victim. I am a survivor. The abuse does not define me, or anyone else who has been abused.‚<U+0080>ùBeyond Dr. Nassar himself, the cases have ensnared U.S.A. Gymnastics and many of its top officials, whom lawsuits have accused of turning a blind eye and of fostering toxic environments in which abuse could flourish. Earlier this year, U.S.A. Gymnastics adopted stricter reporting policies in response to an extensive report on its previous failings.Some gymnasts said it was difficult to feel entirely victorious after the sentencing, because Dr. Nassar was part of a much larger problem.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, the justice feels very incomplete,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said at a news conference on Thursday.NASHVILLE, Tenn. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A longtime pastor has been returned to Tennessee to face charges that he molested several children during his time leading a Nashville congregation.Media reports say Matthew Dennis Patterson was arrested March 8 by Nashville police in Pennsylvania, where he moved after leaving the Tennessee church last September.Patterson was extradited to Nashville on Friday.He served as pastor of Nolensville Road Baptist Church. After his resignation, authorities say church members went to police with complaints about his requests to ""engage in strange activities"" with children.According to a police statement, children told adult church members that Patterson had asked them to sit on his face and stomach, sometimes in their underwear.Patterson has been indicted on eight counts of aggravated sexual battery. Police say each count is linked to a different child.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a child sex abuse scandal that has rocked English soccer, a former youth coach and talent scout who worked for a number of well-known teams was convicted on Tuesday of 36 counts of sexually assaulting boys aged 8 to 15, from 1979 to 1990.The case against the former coach, Barry Bennell, began in late 2016, when Andrew Woodward became the first professional player to say publicly that he had been molested by a coach, accusing Mr. Bennell. But the scandal widened, as other allegations were made against Mr. Bennell, and then against other well-known coaches and scouts, until those stepping forward to say they had been victimized numbered in the hundreds, including dozens of former professionals.Soccer has taken its place among the institutions tarnished by the disclosure of systematic sexual exploitation, including the Roman Catholic Church, the news media and Hollywood. In Britain, the case of Mr. Bennell came after revelations that Jimmy Savile, a longtime host of BBC television shows who died in 2011, had molested dozens of children.From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Mr. Bennell, now 64, worked for several well-known professional teams ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one, Manchester City, that plays in the upper echelon of the game ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as a scout and sometime coach for youth programs. The work gave him access to boys who lived away from their parents at times.Prosecutors said that he equipped his home with video games, exotic animals and fast food to make it attractive to boys, and that he abused them there and in his car.Twice in the 1990s and again in 2015, Mr. Bennell ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has changed his name to Richard Jones ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was convicted of multiple counts of sexually abusing youth players and sent to prison. The latest revelations were surprising less in that additional long-ago victims might be found than in the numbers and prominence of some of them.The jury in Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday found him not guilty of three charges, and they will continue deliberating on seven others.CHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Federal prosecutors on Friday for the first time provided details of sexual abuse allegations against J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, asserting that he molested at least four boys, as young as 14, when he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades ago.Mr. Hastert, 74, is not charged with abuse because of statutes of limitation, prosecutors said, but he was accused last year of illegally structuring bank withdrawals to pay one of his victims in an effort to hide the abuse. He pleaded guilty in October to the banking violation, and suffered a stroke in November while awaiting sentencing, set for April 27.In a court filing late Friday, making suggestions for a judge who will decide Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentence, the prosecutors described specific, graphic incidents that they say occurred when Mr. Hastert was a popular, championship-winning coach in a small Illinois town in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. The ‚<U+0080><U+009C>known acts,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said, consisted of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intentional touching of minors‚<U+0080><U+0099> groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The actions at the core of this case took place not on the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national public stage but in his private one-on-one encounters in an empty locker room and a motel room with minors that violated the special trust between those young boys and their coach,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors wrote.A lawyer for Mr. Hastert did not reply to a request for comment on the prosecution claims. In a court filing earlier this week, Mr. Hastert, who has stayed largely out of view since the charges emerged nearly a year ago, requested probation and said he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>profoundly sorry‚<U+0080>ù for past conduct, though he did not specify those actions. On Friday, Mr. Hastert also filed under a seal a response to the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-sentence investigation. A hearing is set for next week on whether his filing remains under seal.According to the prosecutors, Mr. Hastert gave one boy, a 14-year-old freshman wrestler, a massage in the locker room, then performed an unspecified sex act on him. Another boy, Stephen Reinboldt, who died in 1995, was sexually abused by Mr. Hastert throughout high school in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his sister and others told the prosecutors. A third boy, who was 17 and remembered Mr. Hastert sitting in a recliner-type chair with a direct view of the locker room shower stalls, said Mr. Hastert had told him that one way to make his wrestling weight was to get a massage, then performed a sexual act. And prosecutors said Mr. Hastert had massaged another boy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s groin area after asking the boy to stay in his hotel room during a wrestling camp.That incident became the center of the prosecution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. It was also the reason that the allegations, which were never exposed during Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s eight years as the Republican speaker of the House, came to light. The boy, known in court documents as Individual A, confronted Mr. Hastert years later, around 2010, asked him why he had done what he did, and sought a settlement ‚<U+0080><U+0094> beginning the payments that would be Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s downfall.In late 2014, as law enforcement authorities were investigating unusually large withdrawals from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bank account, Mr. Hastert said that he was doing nothing unusual with his money ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and that he simply did not trust banks. Not long after, his lawyer told the investigators a different story: The lawyer said that Mr. Hastert was paying large sums ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and promising as much as $3.5 million, the authorities say ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to Individual A because Individual A was extorting him for false allegations of abuse.After a series of recorded phone calls, with Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation, the investigators concluded that there was no extortion, but that Mr. Hastert was actually carrying out an agreed-to settlement for real abuse.Even when Mr. Hastert told Individual A, as investigators listened in, that he needed more time to come up with more money, Individual A ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did not make any threats‚<U+0080>ù and even ‚<U+0080><U+009C>expressed understanding,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. At another point, Individual A seemed agreeable, even empathetic, suggesting that they settle on smaller amounts and keep the payments as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>private, personal matter.‚<U+0080>ù Individual A even pushed Mr. Hastert to tell his wife about the payment agreement, and suggested that an outside lawyer or confidante might be called in.Of the abuse of Individual A, prosecutors said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no ambiguity.‚<U+0080>ùProsecutors said the motel incident had happened during a trip to a wrestling camp, in which several other boys shared a room but where Individual A and Mr. Hastert spent the night together. Individual A told prosecutors he did not know why Mr. Hastert had singled him out.The court filing says Mr. Hastert had the boy strip naked and lay on a bed under the guise of treating a groin pull, but it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became clear to Individual A that defendant was not touching him in a therapeutic manner to address a wrestling injury but was touching him in an inappropriate sexual way.‚<U+0080>ù The boy then ran across the room, confused and embarrassed, before Mr. Hastert asked him to get onto Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s back and to give the coach a massage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Defendant lay on the bed in only his underwear, and Individual A gave him a back massage,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They then went to sleep in the same bed.‚<U+0080>ùWhen Mr. Hastert was charged last year, the accusations rattled the town of Yorkville, Ill., about an hour west of here. Mr. Hastert, a Republican who served as House speaker from 1999 to 2007, was regarded as a hero by many in Yorkville, where he had taught high school. But prosecutors said Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marred by stunning hypocrisy.‚<U+0080>ùThey alluded to a fifth boy from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s days in Yorkville who recalled Coach Hastert brushing against his genitals during a massage at one point. But he said he was unsure whether the contact was intentional though he found it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>very weird.‚<U+0080>ùOf the boys, prosecutors said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He made them feel alone, ashamed, guilty and devoid of dignity. While defendant achieved great success, reaping all the benefits that went with it, these boys struggled, and all are still struggling now with what defendant did to them.‚<U+0080>ùIn the court filing, prosecutors said they believed Mr. Hastert should face up to six months in prison, as suggested under federal guidelines.Prosecutors took note of Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor health, but said that Mr. Hastert could continue getting medical care in prison if needed.Steven A. Block, an assistant United States Attorney, said that Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentencing judge should ‚<U+0080><U+009C>balance the positive nature of defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public service with the need to avoid a public perception that the powerful are treated differently than ordinary citizens when facing sentencing for a serious crime.‚<U+0080>ùBEIJING ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Thirty years after Gao Chengyong embarked on a succession of 11 rape-murders of women in northwest China, a court sentenced him to death on Friday, following an investigation that involved sifting through 230,000 fingerprints.The sentence by a court in Baiyin, a small city in Gansu Province, was not unexpected in China, which executes more prisoners than any other. But the verdict against Mr. Gao, 53, a farmer, itinerant worker and shopkeeper, was widely reported, and applauded, in China, where the killings drew intense attention.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The motives for the defendant Gao Chengyong‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crimes were utterly despicable, the means were utterly vicious, the nature of the crimes utterly vile,‚<U+0080>ù the court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s verdict stated, according to the China News Service, an official agency.The court found that Mr. Gao had killed 11 women, whom he usually followed to their homes. He murdered all but one around Baiyin; another woman was killed in Baotou, a city in the north Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. In many cases, he molested the women and dismembered their bodies. Besides homicide, he also was found guilty of rape and of defiling corpses. He stood trial last July.When Mr. Gao was arrested in 2016, the last murder had taken place 14 years earlier, and the police needed advanced forensic technology, as well as an element of chance, to link him to the crimes.Zhang Enwei, a forensic detective who helped solve the murders, said he had checked 230,000 sets of fingerprints trying to identify a suspect, Beijing News, a newspaper, reported on Friday. But Mr. Gao was one of hundreds of millions of rural migrants who move around, often slipping past city data checks, and he was not caught in the dragnet for fingerprints in Baiyin.But by 2011, the detectives in Baiyin had acquired technology to trace DNA clues, and five years later a relative of Mr. Gao had his DNA sample taken after he was suspected of giving kickbacks. Their shared traits led the investigators to Mr. Gao, who was then running a small store in a school in Baiyin with his wife.Mr. Zhang said Mr. Gao was very calm when he was shown the evidence, according to the Beijing News. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Basically he did not offer too much of a defense,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Mr. Zhang said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew that this day would come.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Gao said he would not appeal the sentence. In an interview last year, his defense lawyer, Zhu Aijun, denied reports that Mr. Gao had chosen as his victims only women and girls with long hair and dressed in red.Mr. Gao said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chosen his targets for crimes at random,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Zhu told a Chinese news website. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That was one of the reasons that it was so hard to crack the case for a long time.‚<U+0080>ùSALT LAKE CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Mormon church is changing its guidelines for how local leaders handle sexual abuse reports and one-on-one meetings with youth a week after a former prominent missionary leader was accused of sexually assaulting two women in the 1980s.The changes announced Monday by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints direct lay leaders never to disregard a report of abuse, a more direct instruction than previous guidelines.A key new rule allows children to bring a parent or adult with them during one-one-one interviews with local church leaders known as bishops. Parents were only allowed in a hallway or adjacent room under old rules. Youth can still go in alone if they choose.Critics say the changes still don't go far enough.The guidelines also tell leaders to never encourage a person to stay in a home or situation where abuse is suspected, guidance not in there before. An introduction to the guidelines says most, but not all, ""allegations of abuse made by assault victims are true, and should be taken seriously and handled with great care.""The meetings with children usually happen twice a year starting at age 12. Bishops ask about topics such as school, sports, hobbies, education goals and family issues. The questions sometimes delve into sexual behavior because of the church's strict teachings on abstinence before marriage.Last year, a group of Mormons and ex-Mormons demanded an end to the one-on-one interviews and a prohibition on all sexual questions.Sam Young, a Mormon father from Houston who is leading the campaign, said Tuesday the changes don't go far enough. He said a parent or adult should be required for all meetings. He said sexual questions often become explicit and argues children should only be asked if they are obeying the faith's law of chastity.The group plans a protest march Friday in Salt Lake City and expects to deliver 50,000 signatures to church headquarters.""Our march is even more important than it's ever been because we know the church is listening,"" said Young, 65, a former bishop and missionary. ""I care about the church. This is my church. What are we're doing harming these children gives my church a horrid name.""Mormon church spokesman Eric Hawkins on Tuesday pointed to previous comments that the interviews allow bishops to get to know youth better and determine their religious habits and obedience to God. The bishops are instructed how to handle the meetings and swear to keep the conversations confidential, he said.""They are counseled to not be unnecessarily probing or invasive in their questions, but should allow a young person to share their experiences, struggles and feelings,"" Hawkins said.Former Mormon Amy Hall, 56, compared the changes to ""putting a Band-Aid on open surgery.""She said she was molested around the age of 12 by a bishop in Bakersfield, California, causing her a lifetime of shame and leading her to leave the faith in her 20s. The Associated Press doesn't normally name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Hall agreed to share her story to support Young's campaign and said she hopes other Mormon children don't have to endure similar abuse.She never reported her abuse and only recently confronted how it impacted her life, adding she is in therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Asking children about sexual things is perverted,"" Hall said.A letter sent by new Mormon president Russell M. Nelson to local and regional leaders in the U.S. and Canada announced the changes. ""This global issue continues to be of great concern to us today,"" Nelson wrote.The changes come as the church investigates two allegations of sexual abuse against a former missionary leader in the 1980s. Joseph L. Bishop has denied the allegations through his adult son but he acknowledged in a police interview that he asked one of the women to expose her breasts at a time when he was president of the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.Bishop is also heard apologizing on a secretly recorded conversation made by one of the victims. He is heard saying he molested the second woman during a massage that he said got ""too frisky.""The church said it knew previously about both claims, but declined to discipline Bishop because the allegations couldn't be verified.This past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Denver ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The radio host whom Taylor Swift has accused of groping her testified Tuesday that her version of what occurred is false and that her account, embraced and acted upon by his employers, ruined his life.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cost me my career, the thing I love to do, my passion,‚<U+0080>ù the host, David Mueller, who was known on air as Jackson, said. He was the first witness to testify in the trial that grew from the civil case he filed in 2015 against Ms. Swift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been hard on my friends,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has an impact on my girlfriend. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable.‚<U+0080>ùIn court documents, Ms. Swift says Mr. Mueller put his hand up her dress and grabbed her bottom as he posed for a photograph with her before a June 2, 2013, concert in Denver. Mr. Mueller contends Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account led the Denver radio station KYGO to fire him and he later sued the entertainer, her mother and one of her managers. Ms. Swift then countersued, accusing Mr. Mueller of assault and battery.Eight jurors ‚<U+0080><U+0094> six women and two men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will decide the two suits and they listened Tuesday in United States District Court here as both sides outlined their cases.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, hammered at Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility during cross-examination, raising, for example, the disappearance of recordings that Mr. Mueller had secretly made of conversations with his bosses about Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations. And while Mr. Mueller said he had filed suit to clear his name, not to win a specific amount in damages, he acknowledged to Mr. Baldridge that he had hired an expert who determined the termination had cost him nearly $3 million.Mr. Mueller also acknowledged a strained relationship with his superiors at KYGO before the encounter with Ms. Swift and he noted that his suit targets only Ms. Swift and her associates, not the station or its executives.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He wants you to give him the payday,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Baldridge told the jurors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is trying to make the victim pay the price.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift, who also is scheduled to testify, sat with her lawyers and looked at Mr. Mueller occasionally during his testimony. At times she appeared to be taking notes which she shared with her mother. It is unclear when Ms. Swift will take the stand.Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice was shaky at the start of his testimony under questioning by his lawyer but grew steadier. Pressed hard for answers during the cross-examination, his voice occasionally rose in pitch and several times he looked toward the judge, as if for support, when questions came in a barrage.His lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, said in his opening statement that his client, who was with his girlfriend during the photo shoot, had no reason to jeopardize a lucrative job and a budding relationship by groping Ms. Swift.Mr. Mueller repeatedly denied groping Ms. Swift. He said that he reached out with his right arm and a closed hand and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>felt what seemed to be a rib cage‚<U+0080>ù with his knuckles as he rushed to get into position for the photograph. In that image, which was shown to jurors Tuesday, Ms. Swift is standing at a slight distance from Mr. Mueller, whose right arm is extended behind her back and toward her bottom. His hand is not visible and is it not possible to see whether the back of her skirt has been moved.Under questioning from Mr. Baldridge, Mr. Mueller said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible‚<U+0080>ù his hand came into contact with Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bottom, and if so she had a right to tell KYGO officials.Mr. Mueller also testified about a conversation he said he had with his boss, Hershel Coomer, known professionally as Eddie Haskell. He said Mr. Coomer, a longtime acquaintance of Ms. Swift, told him that he had greeted her at the Pepsi Center by putting his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hand on her butt.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mueller described Mr. Coomer going on to speculate that the singer wore bicycle shorts under her stage outfits. Mr. Mueller said he did not give that account to imply Mr. Coomer had groped Ms. Swift.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer said Mr. Coomer would testify that he never said the things Mr. Mueller has attributed to him.Mr. Baldridge described Ms. Swift as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taking a stand through this case for all women, including my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fans rose early for a chance to see her in court and filled a quarter of the courtroom. The presiding judge, William J. Mart√≠nez, set aside 32 seats for the public in the courtroom and 75 in an overflow room with a closed circuit video feed of the proceedings.Lucy Peterson, 17, arrived at the downtown Denver courthouse just after 4 a.m. Tuesday with two friends from her Denver high school to seize the first places in a line that had grown to two dozen by 8 a.m. Ms. Peterson said she believed many of Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s admirers had experienced sexual harassment and looked up to the star for speaking out about something that others might be embarrassed or afraid to address.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shedding light on the issue and I hope bringing more attention to it,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Peterson said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her experiences,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not different from ours.‚<U+0080>ùSYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats.But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter.Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crony politics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,‚<U+0080>ù said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland.The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is not a healthy place,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Joyce, a gregarious bull of a man often seen in a trademark Akubra bush hat, now faces a series of uncomfortable questions:‚<U+0080>¢ Were public funds used to cultivate an extramarital affair?‚<U+0080>¢ How did he and his new partner, Vikki Campion, a former journalist, end up in a supporter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s free apartment?‚<U+0080>¢ How did Ms. Campion  secure a high-paying job with a Parliament colleague?‚<U+0080>¢ And, did Mr. Joyce grope a woman after an awards ceremony in 2011?Mr. Joyce, 50, has denied groping and other ministerial misconduct. He has spent much of the week offering defiance and remorse, and trying to hold on to his job.He acknowledged his relationship with Ms. Campion on Tuesday, apologizing to his family, his constituents and the National Party of Australia, which he still leads.But he also told his party colleagues he would not step down. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Every political career has a time of trial,‚<U+0080>ù he said.His stand fits with his longstanding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>just a bloke‚<U+0080>ù appeal. He grew up on a farm in Tamworth, in Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s southeast, which is home of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s largest country music festival. Mr. Joyce is known as an off-the-cuff maverick who is loyal less to ideology than to his constituents.But since 2004, he has been a Canberra man. He was a senator for Queensland and then joined the House of Representatives in 2013. He became leader of the National Party and deputy prime minister in 2016.Mr. Joyce is no stranger to scandal. A few years ago he made headlines worldwide when he threatened to euthanize two dogs belonging to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after the celebrity couple brought them to Australia without the proper documentation and quarantine.Last year, Mr. Joyce was one of several politicians revealed as holding dual citizenship.After the High Court ruled that he had been ineligible to run for Parliament because of it, Mr. Joyce renounced his New Zealand citizenship and returned to his district to campaign again for his seat. He won comfortably.But experts say the backlash has only been intensified by his supposed authenticity, his eagerness to parade his wife and four children in political campaigns, and his brash conservative positions, like his opposition to same-sex marriage, which he argued would destroy families.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The public expected a Barnaby that was a solid country family man, and we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re seeing that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not that at all,‚<U+0080>ù said Jill Sheppard, a lecturer in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there was a political trait Australians hate, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hypocrisy,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said.But the biggest threat to Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s career may involve questions about the mingling of adultery, money and power.Records show he claimed a travel allowance for 50 nights in Canberra last year when Parliament was not in session, far more than other senior leaders.Government watchdogs and journalists have also zeroed in on two high-paying positions that were allegedly created for Ms. Campion in the offices of a party colleague, Senator Matt Canavan.Mr. Joyce and Prime Minister Turnbull ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has continued to back him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> said the jobs were beyond reproach because Ms. Campion was not technically his partner at the time.Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s critics contest that assertion.Officially, for now, Mr. Joyce still has the support of his party. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Barnaby Joyce is the best deliverer for rural and regional Australians in generations,‚<U+0080>ù  Bridget McKenzie, the Nationals deputy, told reporters on Wednesday.But time is not on his side. Mr. Turnbull is scheduled for an overseas trip that includes meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23, which would make Mr. Joyce the acting prime minister.A broader reckoning on the capital‚<U+0080><U+0099>s workplace culture may also be coming.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the Australian public feels the political class is isolated and don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t appreciate their concerns, then that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem the political class has to respond to,‚<U+0080>ù said Andrew Giles, a Labor Party politician.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not meeting people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expectations,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re legitimate expectations.‚<U+0080>ùIf ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù suffered any loss of visibility during its monthlong Winter Olympics hiatus, the show got a most unusual promotional boost on Friday. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when President Trump, a frequent target of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù and a once-vocal critic of the show, broke a monthslong silence and went on Twitter to vent his spleen at Alec Baldwin, his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù impersonator.A complete rundown of the Trump-Baldwin spat can be found here, but to quickly summarize, Baldwin in an interview on Thursday said that every time he plays the president now, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like agony,‚<U+0080>ù adding that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we have to get rid of him.‚<U+0080>ù In response, Trump tweeted that Baldwin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me‚<U+0080>ù and that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>agony for those who were forced to watch.‚<U+0080>ù Baldwin then followed with a series of tweets in which he mused, among other things, that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to stick around in the role long enough ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride‚<U+0080>ù to Mar-a-Lago.This weekend‚<U+0080><U+0099>s broadcast of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.,‚<U+0080>ù hosted by Charles Barkley and featuring the musical guest Migos, didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t directly acknowledge the feud, though it did give Baldwin plenty of airtime to lampoon the president in its opening sketch.In what purported to be another presidential listening session on gun control, Baldwin (as Trump) led off by addressing the audience: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tonight I am here to bring you a message of healing and a show of unity,‚<U+0080>ù he said as he looked at his notes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hear you and I care. Rent ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Lego Ninjago Movie.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Sorry, Eric scribbled some notes on there, too.‚<U+0080>ùAfter contemplating the idea of taking guns away from all Americans ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even whites‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+0094> Baldwin went on to address the latest personnel losses in the Trump administration. Paying homage to Hope Hicks, the outgoing White House communications director, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like a daughter to me. So smart, so hot. You know, I hate seeing her go but I love watching her walk away.‚<U+0080>ùIn her absence, Baldwin said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jared Kushner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basically the hottest chick left in the place.‚<U+0080>ù And when he sought assurance from Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that he was still on board, the camera cut to an empty chair with McMaster‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name in front of it.Turning to the subject of tariffs, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Both sides hated it. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I said I was going to run this country like a business. That business is a Waffle House at 2 a.m. Crazies everywhere, staff walking out in the middle of their shift, managers taking money out of the cash register to pay off the Russian mob.‚<U+0080>ùIn other highlights from the episode:Though he occasionally stumbled in his delivery, Barkley, the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Inside the NBA‚<U+0080>ù analyst, scored with a pointed comedic commentary on the role of athletes in American civic life. He began:Alluding to the Fox News host Laura Ingraham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recent criticism of LeBron James, Barkley added:At the conclusion of his monologue, Barkley traded riffs with the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Michael Che. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud to stand for the anthem,‚<U+0080>ù Barkley said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unless Fergie is singing it, and I just fall over laughing.‚<U+0080>ùChe responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I stay seated for the anthem, because I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m still in my Uber. Because black people are always late.‚<U+0080>ùOn the night before the Oscars, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù imagined a far more scathing (if timely) event called the Grabbies, presented by the Academy of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Hollywood and dedicated, as an announcer described, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>celebrating this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worst behavior in entertainment.‚<U+0080>ù Its categories include Handsiest Actor, Best Animated Grope, Worst Thing Done to a Plant and the coveted Cecil B. Molestin‚<U+0080><U+0099> Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as Most Open Robe. Previewing his possible awards speech, an actor played by Pete Davidson said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, first, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to thank guns for pivoting the national conversation away from harassment. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d also like to thank my uncle for always saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Boys will be boys.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Even when it was, like, O.J.‚<U+0080>ùPlaying the soon-to-be departed Hope Hicks, Cecily Strong recalled her time at the Trump White House as if it were summer camp. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You make all these new friends,‚<U+0080>ù she explained. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You barely get any sleep and then everybody leaves after eight weeks.‚<U+0080>ù She bid farewell to friends like Kellyanne Conway (‚<U+0080><U+009C>You taught me that a strong woman can run a campaign and win. And you showed me what I could turn into if I stick around too long‚<U+0080>ù), and in a final message to her colleagues, she said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll see you guys at the reunion in 10 years. Seven with good behavior.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù cast member Leslie Jones, who provided running commentary on the Winter Olympics both in person and over Twitter, spoke to the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Colin Jost about her time in Pyeongchang. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a six-foot black woman,‚<U+0080>ù Jones told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You think I stand out in America? Everybody in Korea was 4-foot-1. They either thought I was an athlete or a guy. Some of them thought I was a Transformer, but Transformers don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t eat Korean barbecue like that.‚<U+0080>ùAt the end of her segment, Jones brought out Hilary Knight, a member of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> gold-medal winning women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hockey team, and gave Jost a warning. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be talking about how you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to teach me something,‚<U+0080>ù Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got friends who are gold-medal Olympians.‚<U+0080>ùTo understand what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s at stake in the battle between Apple and the F.B.I. over cracking open a terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphone, it helps to be able to predict the future of the tech industry.For that, here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one bet you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never lose money on: Digital technology always grows hungrier for more personal information, and we users nearly always accede to its demands. Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphones hold a lot of personal data ‚<U+0080><U+0094> your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow‚<U+0080><U+0099>s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.Consider all the technologies we think we want ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.This gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.But if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no longer any room for keeping secrets?‚<U+0080><U+009C>This case can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be a one-time deal,‚<U+0080>ù said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is about the future.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards is the author of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intellectual Privacy,‚<U+0080>ù a book that examines the dangers of a society in which technology and law conspire to eliminate the possibility of thinking without fear of surveillance. He argues that intellectual creativity depends on a baseline measure of privacy, and that privacy is being eroded by cameras, microphones and sensors we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re all voluntarily surrounding ourselves with.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>deviant‚<U+0080><U+0099> ideas ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The particular legal issue is actually quite narrow,‚<U+0080>ù James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., wrote in a blog post on Sunday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s it.‚<U+0080>ùBut civil liberties activists say they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d have an easier time believing Mr. Comey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s assurances if there weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a long history of the government relying on legal cases based on old technology to decide how to handle newer technologies. Courts in the 1960s and 1970s created rules for the wiretapping of analog phone calls; those rulings were later applied as the basis for mass surveillance of the Internet.‚<U+0080><U+009C>By and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before email, before search engines, before social networks,‚<U+0080>ù said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Soghoian pointed out the government had already tried to turn connected devices into surveillance machines. In a mob case more than a decade ago, the F.B.I. asked a company that made an in-dash roadside assistance device ‚<U+0080><U+0094> something like OnStar, which uses a cellular phone to connect to an operator in case of an emergency ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to secretly record the private conversations of people inside a car. A court ruled against the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s request, but only on the very narrow grounds that bugging the car would have interfered with the proper functioning of the in-dash device.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Soghoian said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Soghoian was referring to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s handy digital assistant, a device that is constantly listening to your household conversations to try to offer you friendly help. The Echo listens for a keyword ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alexa!‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prompts it to start streaming your voice to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s servers to decipher your request. Amazon, which declined to comment on how the Apple case might affect Echo users‚<U+0080><U+0099> privacy, has said it is not constantly recording people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voices, and that it keeps voice recordings only to help the system learn to better understand you.But the Apple case threatens to undermine those promises. If a court can get Apple to hack into an iPhone, why couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t it also force Amazon to change the Echo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s security model so the Echo can record everything you say? Mr. Soghoian believes the Apple case could set that precedent.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Some readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t buy the Amazon Echo. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t put cameras in your house. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re home and when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not.There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.The Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From a historical perspective, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re entering into a very new era,‚<U+0080>ù said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.‚<U+0080>ùBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Now we have a surveillance-enabled world,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Granick said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cheap, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy. The question that society has to ask is, Is that what we really want?‚<U+0080>ùAn Alaska Airlines pilot has sued the airline, alleging she was drugged and raped by another pilot during a layover last year.The lawsuit by Betty Pina, 39, was filed in King County Superior Court in Washington State on Wednesday, 20 days after it was presented to the airline on Feb. 13. A copy of the complaint was provided by her lawyer, Eric John Makus.It claims that Ms. Pina, an Army veteran who flew helicopter missions in Afghanistan, was the co-pilot on a June flight with the captain from Anchorage to Seattle to Minneapolis, where the two had a scheduled layover.According to the complaint, the pilot asked Ms. Pina to join him for pizza and drinks in the hotel bar where flight crews spend time. Once there, Ms. Pina said she had one glass of wine, and then he brought her a second. Sitting on a stool, she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hard time keeping her head up‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>things appeared to be closing in,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint says.It claims that he proceeded to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>drug Ms. Pina and rape her during a state of involuntary intoxication.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawsuit was reported this week by The Seattle Times and other local news outlets.In an interview late on Thursday, Ms. Pina, reached between flights, repeated many of the details in the lawsuit. It says she blacked out, and when she came to early the next morning, she was in his hotel room bed, naked from the waist down; her underwear was in her purse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew something gravely bad had happened,‚<U+0080>ù she said in the interview.In the lawsuit, she said she was sick and vomited, and when she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>challenged‚<U+0080>ù the pilot, he denied that there had been sexual contact and replied, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You were coming on to me pretty hard.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the lawsuit, a flight attendant told a flight operations officer that she saw the pilot walking down the hall ‚<U+0080><U+009C>with a girl and two glasses of wine,‚<U+0080>ù and that the attendant expressed concern about flying with him.The two were taken off duty for the return to Seattle on June 6, the day after the episode. Ms. Pina said over subsequent weeks, she reported details of what she could remember to the union, an airline human resource official and an investigator referred by the airline. She did not report the episode to the police.She did not fly again until January, she said.Ms. Pina is seeking damages for workplace rape and the airline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unlawfully retaliatory‚<U+0080>ù actions, according to the complaint. It claims that the airline has failed to hold the male pilot accountable and that he poses a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>threat to other employees.‚<U+0080>ùCourts in the United States have previously tackled the issue of sexual harassment of flight crews during layovers, expanding the definition of a work site. In 2001, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Delta Air Lines was potentially liable for not doing enough to stop what a flight attendant said was a rape by another attendant, even though the events occurred when the two were off duty in a hotel room.In a statement, Alaska Airlines said it was taking the matter seriously.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our policy is to withhold an employee from work during this type of investigation,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was immediately removed from flying back in June and remains on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.‚<U+0080>ùThe pilot, who is not named as a defendant, could not be reached on Friday. He has not been charged with a crime.Ms. Pina has been flying for 17 years, including seven years of active duty military service that included flying Chinook helicopters in Afghanistan, for which she was featured in a PBS documentary series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kansas to Kandahar: Citizen Soldiers at War.‚<U+0080>ùShe started working for Alaska Airlines in 2016. She said that after years in the military, she was accustomed to reporting problems only to her superiors. That, she said, might explain why she did not report what happened to the police when she returned to the Seattle area.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought to call the police,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was more worried about my job than my own personal safety.‚<U+0080>ùBut over time, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew I failed myself.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Pina said that she pursued the lawsuit because she wanted the company to hold the pilot accountable. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened on an overnight with a captain who was abusing his position of authority in an opportunity with me being in a hotel right next to him,‚<U+0080>ù she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It needs to stop from being swept under the rug,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t hate my company. I just hope they step up, and say we have zero tolerance and maybe make any future attackers think twice and not follow through.‚<U+0080>ùA prominent volleyball coach in Illinois is accused of sexually abusing and raping teenage athletes in the 1980s, in hotel rooms, on a train and elsewhere, according to a class-action lawsuit filed this week.The coach, Rick Butler, and his wife, Cheryl, deceived parents and young players into joining the Sports Performance Volleyball Club in Aurora, Ill., the lawsuit claims, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>based upon false information and material omissions‚<U+0080>ù regarding allegations of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sexual abuse of underage girls‚<U+0080>ù by Mr. Butler.The Butlers were named as defendants in the  lawsuit, which was filed in District Court in Illinois on Tuesday by Laura Mullen, the mother of an athlete who trained at the club in 2012. Ms. Mullen said that she would never have sent her daughters to the club had she known about the allegations against Mr. Butler.The court documents, reported by The Chicago Sun-Times on Tuesday, say that Mr. Butler continued to coach even though U.S.A. Volleyball, the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national governing body, barred him in 1995 over allegations that he sexually abused three teenage athletes. The organization partly lifted the ban in 2000, and Mr. Butler, who was never charged with a crime, returned to coaching. He was permanently barred earlier this year.The lawsuit, which seeks a jury trial and compensation for fees paid to the club, claims at least six teenagers were abused by Mr. Butler and describes allegations from five of them. Some of their accounts were first published in November by The Sun-Times.In a statement at the time to the newspaper, released through a lawyer, Mr. Butler said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have never sexually abused any individual.‚<U+0080>ù On Thursday, the office of the lawyer, Terry Ekl, said he was not representing Mr. Butler in the class-action lawsuit.Two people who answered the telephone at Mr. Butler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s club on Thursday said the couple was not there, and the Butlers did not reply to emails. It was not clear whether they had a lawyer.Ms. Mullen said she was never informed of any investigations into the abuse, including those carried out by the state Department of Children and Family Services and by U.S.A. Volleyball. In the 72-page lawsuit, Mr. Butler is described as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the most powerful coach in youth volleyball,‚<U+0080>ù with the ability to place athletes at top college programs.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For over three decades, Rick has used his position of power to sexually abuse no fewer than six underage teenage girls, and likely many more,‚<U+0080>ù the lawsuit says.The women who have accused Mr. Butler are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which details their accounts. One described alleged sexual abuse and rape by Mr. Butler starting when she was 16, in the early 1980s, during team trips, in a hotel, and in a train bathroom. Another accused Mr. Butler of sexually abusing her in 1986, when she was 16, during a team trip to Japan, and raping her in a hotel room when they returned. The lawsuit also claims that he assaulted the teenagers in the weight room of a gym, his car and his apartment.Mr. Butler ‚<U+0080><U+009C>set up an environment of dependency and fear‚<U+0080>ù by threatening to derail the teenagers‚<U+0080><U+0099> athletic careers if they did not accede to his demands, the lawsuit claims. Ms. Butler is accused of harassing the women on social media and with a phone call to keep them quiet.In 1995, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services investigated Mr. Butler, according to the lawsuit, and determined that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>credible evidence supported an indicated report of abuse.‚<U+0080>ù An administrative law judge later concluded that Mr. Butler ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had sexual relationships with at least three players.‚<U+0080>ùHad parents known ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that a child sexual predator would coach their teenage daughters,‚<U+0080>ù the lawsuit says, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they never would have given money to defendants and never would have sent their girls to Sports Performance.‚<U+0080>ùIn response to the Sun-Times report, U.S.A. Volleyball announced in January that it would permanently bar Mr. Butler. On Feb. 9, the Amateur Athletic Union, which promotes and develops amateur sports in the United States, said it had permanently disqualified Mr. Butler from its activities.The lawsuit comes at a time when the sports world has been shaken by cases of sexual abuse against young athletes. In hearings in Michigan in January, dozens of young women and teenagers described abuse by Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics, who also ran a clinic at Michigan State University.Dr. Nassar received several lengthy prison sentences, including one of 40 to 175 years, and the case prompted investigations and a shake-up at U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State.The lawsuit in Illinois claims an M.S.U. coach had helped Mr. Butler identify recruits and took an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>active role‚<U+0080>ù in discouraging his alleged victims from speaking out.The lawsuit also included an excerpt from a document it says Ms. Butler published online last month, and which is no longer available, in which Mr. Butler said the 1980s were a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>different time and era in the sport of volleyball and life in general‚<U+0080>ù and that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>could have used better judgment.‚<U+0080>ùJay Edelson, Ms. Mullen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, said on Thursday that his law firm would donate the fees from any award in the case to charity. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will not profit from this,‚<U+0080>ù he said.In 1995, Drew Dixon was working her dream job as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, helping to oversee a chart-topping album and a ubiquitous single by Method Man and Mary J. Blige. But as her star rose, Ms. Dixon, then 24, was spiraling into depression, she said, because of prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, Russell Simmons, the rap mogul and co-founder of the label.On work calls, he would talk graphically about how she aroused him. At a staff meeting, he asked her to sit on his lap. He regularly exposed his erect penis to her. Late that year, Mr. Simmons raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment, Ms. Dixon said. She quit Def Jam soon after.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was broken,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In recent interviews, four women spoke on the record about a pattern of violent sexual behavior by Mr. Simmons, disclosing incidents from 1988 to 2014. Three of the women say that he raped them.In each case, numerous friends and associates said they were told of the incidents at the time. The women said they were inspired to come forward in the aftermath of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, as victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> stories have been newly elevated and more often believed.Told in detail about the rape accusations and other misconduct, Mr. Simmons, 60, said in a statement: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have enormous respect for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power.‚<U+0080>ù[Read Russell Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Complete Statement]Last month, Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a forefather of hip-hop who went on to great success in fashion, media and more ‚<U+0080><U+0094> apologized for being ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thoughtless and insensitive‚<U+0080>ù and announced he was stepping down from his companies after the screenwriter Jenny Lumet became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual assault at the time.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have re-dedicated myself to spiritual learning, healing and working on behalf of the communities to which I have devoted my life,‚<U+0080>ù he said in his statement on Wednesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have accepted that I can and should get dirt on my sleeves if it means witnessing the birth of a new consciousness about women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What I will not accept is responsibility for what I have not done. I have conducted my life with a message of peace and love. Although I have been candid about how I have lived in books and interviews detailing my flaws, I will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.‚<U+0080>ùThe most powerful men and companies in popular music have thus far gone largely unscathed in the national reckoning over sexual abuse. A major reason: Sex and debauchery are built into the music industry, where the boundaries between work and play blur in late nights at clubs and studios, and many women have scant power or incentive to complain about being mistreated.These women still face powerful industry gatekeepers like Mr. Simmons, whose pedigree and ability to make or break careers allowed his abusive behavior to go unchallenged for decades, his accusers contend. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Russell was like the king of hip-hop,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.She said she was later harassed by another boss, L.A. Reid, the music legend known for his work with TLC and Mariah Carey, driving her from a business where women had little autonomy. In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Reid did not address the specific claims but apologized if his words were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misinterpreted.‚<U+0080>ùBlack women, especially, felt powerless against Mr. Simmons and his cohort in the small world of urban music, with several saying that misconduct against them could go unchecked because their place in the industry was so tenuous. They feared being ostracized, or worse.Three of the women now accusing Mr. Simmons were pursuing careers in the music industry that they said were disrupted or derailed in part by their experiences with him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sing for almost a year,‚<U+0080>ù said Tina Baker, a performer who said Mr. Simmons raped her in the early ‚<U+0080><U+0099>90s, when he was her manager. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The second he agreed to work with me, my budget increased, the label was paying more attention to me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker recalled. But after the assault, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into oblivion.‚<U+0080>ùFirst known as a hyperactive party promoter turned manager from Queens who helped boost Run-DMC, Mr. Simmons was among the first to view hip-hop as a big business and cultural force. In 1983, with the producer Rick Rubin, he made Def Jam the defining rap label of its era, with hits by the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Public Enemy.Even after Mr. Simmons sold his remaining stake in Def Jam for a reported $100 million in 1999, he served as an ambassador for hip-hop through comedy (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Def Comedy Jam‚<U+0080>ù), clothing (Phat Farm) and activism. Today, his company Rush Communications oversees an array of businesses and nonprofits.In 1987, Toni Sallie, a music journalist for the trade magazine Black Radio Exclusive, met Mr. Simmons while on assignment. She found him to be a charming, if gruff, playboy. They ended up going on a few dates before Ms. Sallie, then 28, decided they were not a match.But the two remained cordial, Ms. Sallie said, and in the fall of 1988, Mr. Simmons invited her to his Manhattan apartment for a party he said he was hosting for his girlfriend. When Ms. Sallie arrived, the place was empty except for Mr. Simmons, she recalled. Saying he wanted to show her the apartment, Mr. Simmons led her to his bedroom.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He pushed me on the bed and jumped on top of me, and physically attacked me,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We were fighting. I said no.‚<U+0080>ù He raped her, she said. Two friends, Sheila Brody and Arlene Hirschkowitz, and a colleague confirmed that Ms. Sallie told them about the assault around the time it happened.Through his lawyer, Brad D. Rose, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he dated Ms. Sallie but denied any nonconsensual sex.Ms. Sallie said she was too afraid to report the assault: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I went to the police, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how that would turn out.‚<U+0080>ùShe also worried about her burgeoning career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to understand, I was very much in a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s game,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Sallie said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Black women were just starting to break into the field.‚<U+0080>ùAbout a year later, at a music conference in South Florida, Ms. Sallie, who was then working for Warner Bros. Records, said she encountered Mr. Simmons in a hotel lobby. When he tried to lead her to a dark beach, she resisted and he attacked her, grabbing her by the hair, she said, and even chasing her into the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s restroom before she escaped to her room, where she barricaded the door. (‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did Mr. Simmons conduct himself inappropriately,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rose said.)To this day, Ms. Sallie said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t feel comfortable in a room full of men.‚<U+0080>ùMusic executives she told about the hotel incident brushed it off, she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt alone for 29 years,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like nobody would listen to me.‚<U+0080>ùFollowing the reports of alleged misconduct by Mr. Simmons in November, Ms. Sallie said she contacted the Manhattan district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to accuse him.A law enforcement official confirmed that a woman contacted the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to report an incident from 1988 and added that a different anonymous woman had recently reported an incident from 1991. The official said the incidents had occurred so long ago that the statute of limitations had lapsed and the crimes had not been prosecuted. There are no details about the woman from the 1991 incident.But the official said the women had been referred to the New York Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Special Victims squad so that there would be a record of their complaints if more recent allegations were to emerge.Ms. Baker, the singer, thought Mr. Simmons could elevate her career as her new manager. She had performed as a backup vocalist for Madonna and Bruce Springsteen, and, as Tina B, released pop and dance records in the 1980s.One night in late 1990 or early 1991, she ran into Mr. Simmons at a club, and he invited her back to his apartment to discuss her career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think anything of going,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, having been there many times without incident.This time, though, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it all got really ugly, pretty fast,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. As soon as they entered, Mr. Simmons started pouring drinks and trying to kiss her, leading to a scuffle, she said. She recalled ‚<U+0080><U+009C>him on top of me, pushing me down and him saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fight me,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. She was pinned on the bed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I did nothing, I shut my eyes and waited for it to end.‚<U+0080>ùShe cried the whole way home, she said. In interviews and email, her ex-husband, Arthur Baker, a music producer; her psychologist, Dr. Robin Goldberg; another therapist; and a former roommate all confirmed that she told them she was raped.Mr. Simmons, through his lawyer, said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no recollection of ever having any sexual relations with Ms. Baker.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the assault, Ms. Baker remained tethered to Mr. Simmons professionally, she said. She returned to his apartment for a meeting; Mr. Simmons liked to conduct business while working out in his penthouse. But as soon as he stopped exercising, she said, he pulled out his penis and moved toward her. She fled.Amid strife with her label, she tried to extricate herself from her contract with Mr. Simmons, she said, but he ignored her. Her music ‚<U+0080><U+0094> two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> worth of songwriting and recording ‚<U+0080><U+0094> languished. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a deep depression,‚<U+0080>ù she said, and her recording career foundered.Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did everything he could to professionally promote her career‚<U+0080>ù while Ms. Baker was signed to a label, and then stopped representing her, according to his lawyer.The events took a heavy toll on her romantic relationships. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have sex with a man for almost nine years,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Baker, now a lawyer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a cocoon.‚<U+0080>ùDrew Dixon left Stanford University in 1992 to join the hip-hop revolution.After about two years on the fringes of the business, Ms. Dixon ‚<U+0080><U+0094> whose mother, Sharon Pratt, was mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 until 1995 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had a professional breakthrough: Russell Simmons, whom she had met through friends, was looking for a new A&R executive at Def Jam to scout talent and coordinate hit records.She said he was a decadent figure, complete with a Rolls-Royce ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>living, breathing personification of hip-hop and glamour mixed up‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and his sexual advances started right away and became relentless. At a restaurant, Mr. Simmons pushed Ms. Dixon into a broom closet, she said, and tried to kiss her. At work, he would close the door to her office and expose himself, leading her to give a copy of her key to a male co-worker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>If I ever buzz you, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pick up, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t call me back ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just open my door. That means Russell is in here and he whipped his‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù penis out, she said.Through his lawyer, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he engaged in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>inappropriate conduct‚<U+0080>ù with Ms. Dixon while she worked at Def Jam.Fending him off ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was a full-time job,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Ms. Dixon knew Mr. Simmons valued her expertise. She had an ear for emerging talent, even bringing a rising Notorious B.I.G. to the office.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cut off my one conduit to having any hope of a career,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought if I could survive long enough to have a hit ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a real bona fide hit with my name on it ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I would move categories,‚<U+0080>ù from sexual object to respected colleague.In 1995, Ms. Dixon thought she had found her lifeline. Her first major project ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a soundtrack for the music documentary ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show,‚<U+0080>ù featuring Tupac and A Tribe Called Quest ‚<U+0080><U+0094> went platinum. She and Mr. Simmons were listed as executive producers.One night, as she left the Bowery Bar near Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apartment to get cab money from an A.T.M., she ran into him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have the No. 1 record in the country; I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll order you a car,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled him saying.Waiting for the ride, she let her guard down and entered his apartment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I remember realizing I was cornered,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Dixon, who said she rejected Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual advances that night directly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>many ways to say no‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as well as explaining that she had just had a gynecological procedure and could not have sex. He told her he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and I just blacked out.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The last thing I remember was him pinning me down to kiss me on the bed,‚<U+0080>ù she said. The next thing she recalled was being in Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hot tub, both of them naked and Mr. Simmons gleeful. (Ms. Dixon said she had not been drinking and did not think she had been drugged; rather, she said, she had disassociated from the experience.)Denise Gayle, a friend who was then staying with Ms. Dixon, recalled her coming home in a daze. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She pretty much told me right away that he had sexually assaulted her, that she had told him no, cried and that he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be interested in stopping,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Gayle said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She mentally deteriorated instantly.‚<U+0080>ù Three others confirmed that Ms. Dixon told them about the assault and harassment around that time.Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+009C>emphatically states that he did not have sex with her,‚<U+0080>ù his lawyer said.Soon after, Ms. Dixon said she composed her resignation letter to Def Jam by hand, humiliated and in a panic, crossing out her mistakes rather than starting again. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was going to give up,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Dixon considered escaping to graduate school. But the success of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show‚<U+0080>ù soundtrack had made her taste a commodity, and she started at Arista Records, as an A&R executive under Clive Davis, in 1996. She enjoyed more success, helping to orchestrate smash singles like Whitney Houston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My Love Is Your Love,‚<U+0080>ù Aretha Franklin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Rose Is Still a Rose,‚<U+0080>ù and Santana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maria Maria.‚<U+0080>ùBut even at Arista, the long shadow of Def Jam remained, partly over a dispute about what she said were unpaid business expenses. Ms. Dixon hired a lawyer and threatened to sue Mr. Simmons for sexual harassment, as well as outstanding bills from the label. In 1997, the parties settled out of court. Mr. Rose, Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, confirmed the settlement.Ms. Dixon said she accepted about $30,000 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> around $3,000 for the expenses and the rest for legal fees ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and stayed quiet. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I do not want to be famous for being sexually harassed by Russell Simmons,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said, citing the lingering criticism of black women like Anita Hill, and Desiree Washington, who accused Mike Tyson of rape. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to make records and be famous for that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Dixon hoped to move on with her career at Arista. But in 2000, L.A. Reid replaced Mr. Davis atop the label. Mr. Reid began sexualizing her, Ms. Dixon said, and would turn cold when she denied his unwanted overtures.Ms. Dixon said she tried to parry his come-ons as best she could without offending him. But when she openly defied his demands ‚<U+0080><U+0094> declining his invitation to meet him late at night at his hotel; wearing jeans when he insisted on skirts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she worried that her artists would receive short shrift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a quid pro quo: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have power, you want access, sleep with me ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m going to be really mean to you the next day. And there will be consequences,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Reid left this year as the chairman of Epic Records following accusations of sexual harassment. Told in detail of Ms. Dixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, he said in a statement to The Times: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.‚<U+0080>ùIn 2002, at the top of her game, Ms. Dixon left the music industry for Harvard Business School. She concluded that no matter how many hits she had, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I could not have success in this industry unless I slept with somebody ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a gatekeeper,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that I would be doing it to advance my career, I would hate myself.‚<U+0080>ùPost-Def Jam, Mr. Simmons rebranded his image from high-rolling modelizer, partying with Donald Trump and Naomi Campbell, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Uncle Rush,‚<U+0080>ù a spiritual yogi and elder statesman. He released books like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Success Through Stillness‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Happy Vegan,‚<U+0080>ù while focusing on philanthropy and political advocacy.Ms. Dixon said that years after her experience with Mr. Simmons at Def Jam, he apologized to her at an industry event. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have daughters and I do yoga now, Drew, and I know what I did was wrong, and I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.Yet this Mr. Simmons is not the one that Christina Moore said she encountered in Miami at Art Basel in 2014. Ms. Moore, who was 26 at the time, and a friend bumped into Mr. Simmons in the elevator of Soho Beach House.The women were meeting friends at a bar there, but were lost, Ms. Moore said. Mr. Simmons suggested he knew where to go. Ms. Moore and her friend followed him; he led them to his room. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt duped,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Immediately, Mr. Simmons began to run a bath, Ms. Moore said, and then pushed her up against a column in the room ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hands all over my body, up and down,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt assaulted.‚<U+0080>ù He told Ms. Moore that she was a bad girl and threatened to tie her up, she said. Ms. Moore and her friend bolted.Mr. Simmons recalled meeting Ms. Moore and her friend. He said the women followed him to his room of their own accord and asked him about getting into parties. His lawyer said running the bath was Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>signal to Ms. Moore and her friend to leave.‚<U+0080>ù He denied any misconduct.The whole interaction lasted about five minutes, Ms. Moore said, but it stayed with her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt a lot of shame and guilt at ending up in that situation,‚<U+0080>ù she said.When reports of Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged sexual misconduct began circulating, Ms. Moore grew more alarmed and decided to come forward. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would hate to think what would have happened if I were alone,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Baker, too, spent years feeling guilt over how she handled the situation with Mr. Simmons. After the Weinstein revelations, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I started to get very agitated and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, scanning for mentions of misconduct by Mr. Simmons. She concluded that she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>moral duty‚<U+0080>ù to tell her story.Ms. Sallie said speaking out was a form of affirmation, and relief. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I still cry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. But, she added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m happy that the truth is coming out. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m ready.‚<U+0080>ùThe professional price Ms. Dixon paid was steep, she said. She cannot listen to the taste-shifting music she helped create; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too emotionally taxing. Her promising career was curtailed, her ear for talent wasted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I gave up something that I loved to do,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I erased myself.‚<U+0080>ùNow, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want people to know why.‚<U+0080>ùMAIDUGURI, Nigeria ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The camp was supposed to be a refuge. Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been stolen by war ever since the sixth grade, when she was abducted from her home and raped repeatedly by Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fighters for the next three years.She finally escaped last spring, slipping into the bush while her captors slept. Fourteen years old and alone, she made it to a camp for victims of the war, and had just settled in for the night when she heard footsteps outside her tent. A security officer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice instructed her to come out. Frightened, she obeyed.He took her to his quarters, she said, and raped her.Hours later, after she had returned to her tent, another officer arrived, she said. He raped her, too.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The same day I was brought there, soldiers started coming to rape me,‚<U+0080>ù Falmata said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They did it one after another. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure those two knew about each other.‚<U+0080>ùRape has been a defining horror of the war with Boko Haram, which has consumed northeastern Nigeria for eight years and spread beyond its borders. At least 7,000 women and girls have endured Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual violence, the United Nations estimates. Militants kidnap and rape young girls, teenagers and women, handing them out as so-called brides who are sometimes passed from fighter to fighter.But Nigerian security forces have also raped victims of the war, preying on the people they are assigned to protect. Dozens of cases of rape, sexual violence and sexual exploitation were reported in seven camps in Borno State last year alone, carried out by guards, camp officials, security officers and members of civilian vigilante groups, the United Nations says.More than a year ago, the Nigerian government pledged to investigate the allegations of rape in camps for people displaced by the war, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>these very distressing reports will not be taken lightly.‚<U+0080>ù But accounts of sexual assaults in the camps are still common, including from young girls who say they were raped by soldiers on many occasions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The soldiers would come and hold me so tight,‚<U+0080>ù one 13-year-old girl said in an interview. She said she had been raped about 10 times this year at a camp in Maiduguri, the city at the center of the fight against Boko Haram, before running away for her own safety.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They were old enough to be my parents,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the soldiers who raped her.The Nigerian military has cleared parts of the countryside to hunt for Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hide-outs, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to move into huge settlements throughout northeastern Nigeria. Many other civilians have made it to the camps on their own after fleeing Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deadly assaults.Most of the camps are overflowing, with new arrivals every day. Food and water are often in short supply, residents say, and health workers are battling a cholera outbreak that has killed dozens.At night, the camps are dimly lit. Aid workers come during the day, but typically not after sunset because of wartime curfews. Security forces tightly control who goes in and out of the camps, sometimes coercing women and girls to trade sex for food.Government officials say they need 24-hour security to protect the residents, especially since some of the camps are regular targets of suicide bombers deployed by Boko Haram.But in one camp, called Teachers Village, some residents said the security forces had worked out a system to select their victims. Young women were called to cook for them. After the women finished, security officers insisted that they clean up, telling them to go bathe in the officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> quarters as the men watched.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At first none of us knew they were doing this, but then the stories started to spread around camp that anyone cooking for them would be raped,‚<U+0080>ù said Hadiza, 18.After living in the camp for several weeks, Hadiza said, she was picked to cook for the officers. She was terrified.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Definitely my time has come,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled thinking.Later, she was asked to serve water to four security officers in their room as they dined. One by one they left, she said, until only one man remained. He dragged her into a separate room and raped her, she said.Hadiza was injured, she said, but didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ask for medical care, fearing that the officers would seek revenge. She said she tried to keep a low profile for a couple of weeks, but officers spotted her and raped her again. She said she had been raped as many as 20 times in the camp.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once they identified you as a girl they wanted to have sex with, they would hardly leave you alone a single day,‚<U+0080>ù Hadiza said.By spring, word of the rapes at Teachers Village camp had spread so widely across Maiduguri that people began showing up at the gates to look for missing relatives. Distant relatives arrived for Hadiza and took her away.Last year, President Muhammadu Buhari called for an investigation into sexual assaults at the camps after Human Rights Watch detailed the abuse in a report, ordering new measures to protect the vulnerable. Security officers have received more training, and at least 100 female officers have been deployed inside the camps. As a result, the number of complaints of sexual abuse has declined, according to some aid groups and the police.The police have arrested several men for sexually abusing and exploiting women and girls, according to the United States Embassy. The arrests, made last December, include two police officers, a prison warden, two civilian militia members, a civil servant and three soldiers.But an Army Special Board of Inquiry said in June that allegations against its soldiers at the camps were unfounded, while Jimoh Moshood, a police spokesman, said the investigations were continuing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Very little progress has been made by Nigerian authorities to implement President Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s promise of justice for the survivors,‚<U+0080>ù said Mausi Segun, the executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The delay reinforces displaced people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sense of helplessness, and likely emboldens more perpetrators to prey on their vulnerability.‚<U+0080>ùIn the war with Boko Haram, Nigerian security forces have been accused of many human rights abuses, including killing innocent civilians and detaining children for months to determine their loyalties.At checkpoints to enter Maiduguri, soldiers and militia members have turned away large groups of displaced people fleeing Boko Haram, unless they can pay an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>entrance fee,‚<U+0080>ù aid workers say. People escaping with their herds are sometimes charged a fee for each animal. Those who can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pay the bribes have been sent back into harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.Inside the camps, soldiers and members of civilian vigilante groups have been accused of forcing people to pay for the privilege of setting up tents or leaky shelters made of tarps and grass. Some displaced people told Amnesty International that they had to sell their belongings to survive, and when they ran out of things to sell, they had to have sex with soldiers and civilian militia members to get food.Falmata, the 14-year-old kidnapped by Boko Haram, said her ordeal began when she was in primary school, enjoying her classwork and dancing to local Kanuri music.Militants stormed into her home and took her while she was caring for her sick mother. They forced her to marry a fighter, but that man died in battle a week later, so they gave her to another husband. She tried to resist, so they gave her a third. Barely a teenager by then, she became pregnant, she said, but the baby died days after he was born.One night, Falmata woke up and realized the whole camp was asleep. Now was the time, she thought. She ran until she reached a village, finding an older woman with a lantern who pointed her to a road. Soldiers spotted her and took her to Dalori Camp, a sprawling site outside Maiduguri.She thought she was being delivered to safety ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but immediately faced the same kind of sexual abuse she had risked her life to flee. And this time it was being committed by the people who were there to protect her.During her two months at the camp, she said, security officers, not always the same men, came for her repeatedly. Falmata described the men as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>soldiers,‚<U+0080>ù but it was unclear if they were members of the military, the police or another security force. She said they carried weapons.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt it would continue forever,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the abuse.She knew she had to flee, again, so she asked for a pass to go to the market. She walked out of the camp the same way she had escaped Boko Haram: alone, with no money and no idea where she was going.As a little girl, she remembered, she had visited her grandmother once in Maiduguri, but she had only a vague idea where. Falmata spotted a man she had seen around the camp who spoke her dialect, and begged for help.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look, I have a problem,‚<U+0080>ù she told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>These people are going to kill me. They come to me every night.‚<U+0080>ùThe two drove around the city for hours, trying to track down Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s grandmother, asking everyone. Eventually, they found her. She had thought Falmata was dead.Falmata now lives with her grandmother, but is too ashamed to tell her what happened. Someday, she hopes to continue her education and become a lawyer. She wants to represent the powerless.The 17-year-old migrant was pregnant. She said she had been raped in her home county, and she knew from the timing that she was carrying her attacker‚<U+0080><U+0099>s child.She wanted to terminate her pregnancy. But she was underage and undocumented, and, after she was caught crossing the border illegally, living in a government shelter.The Trump administration official in charge of her care decided not to grant her access to an abortion ‚<U+0080><U+0094> because, he said, abortion was itself a form of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>violence.‚<U+0080>ùA woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s desire to end a pregnancy springing from rape might be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understandable,‚<U+0080>ù wrote Scott Lloyd, the director of the federal agency that oversees the shelter, in his denial memo on Sunday. But, he wrote, it was not possible to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cure violence with further violence.‚<U+0080>ùHe went on: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We cannot be a place of refuge while we are at the same time a place of violence. We have to choose, and we ought to choose protect life rather than to destroy it.‚<U+0080>ùIt took a lawsuit, a federal court order and an unexpected reversal this week for Jane Poe, as the teenager is known in court papers, to secure access to an abortion. Yet Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo, released by government lawyers in court on Thursday, spells out a fervently uncompromising opposition to abortion that all but guarantees further clashes at the charged intersection of abortion and immigration.The agency Mr. Lloyd leads, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, announced in March that it would prohibit federally funded shelters from taking ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any action that facilitates‚<U+0080>ù an abortion for an unaccompanied minor without his approval. The Trump administration has said that there is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no constitutional right‚<U+0080>ù for young women in the office‚<U+0080><U+0099>s custody to obtain an abortion.The director has personally gone to meet with pregnant teenagers in immigration custody to persuade them not to have abortions, drawing accusations from abortion rights advocates that he is forcing his beliefs onto the young women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This latest revelation exposes the Trump administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s extreme anti-abortion ideology: It seeks to force women to continue pregnancies against their will,‚<U+0080>ù said Brigitte Amiri, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented Jane Poe and two other teenagers who also won the rights to get abortions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will continue to fight to strike down this cruel and heartless policy.‚<U+0080>ùOn Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agency declined to comment on his views on abortion. In October, a spokesman told The Washington Post: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a child in the program who is pregnant, he has been reaching out to her and trying to help as much as possible with life-affirming options.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He by law has custody of these children,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman continued, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and just like a foster parent, he knows that that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot of responsibility, and he is going to make choices that he thinks are best for both the mother and the child.‚<U+0080>ùThe Trump administration had originally opposed a federal judge‚<U+0080><U+0099>s order on Monday to allow Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abortion. Then, for reasons it has not explained, it dropped its legal appeal, clearing Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s path. (She still faces the possibility of deportation.)Government lawyers had pushed to keep Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sealed in court, but agreed to release part of it on Thursday after the A.C.L.U. argued for its unsealing. The group has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy.Though Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers have disclosed almost no information about her out of concerns for her safety and privacy, Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sketches the outlines of her situation. She told shelter workers that she had been raped in her home country, and though she had a boyfriend with whom she had had sex, both she and federal officials came to believe, based on the timing of her assault, that her pregnancy resulted from the rape. She arrived at the border several weeks after the attack.When the shelter confirmed that she was pregnant, she asked for an abortion, only to change her mind after she said her mother had threatened to beat her if she got one. A few days later, however, she decided that she wanted it, and later threatened to hurt herself if she did not receive it. She was nearly 22 weeks pregnant when Mr. Lloyd said no.Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo describes the abortion procedure, known as dilation and evacuation, that she would have to undergo at that stage of pregnancy as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one that even many abortionists find troublesome.‚<U+0080>ù He cites anecdotal evidence, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>impossible to ignore,‚<U+0080>ù that abortions can be a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating trauma‚<U+0080>ù for women, even as he concedes that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>formal research on this matter appears to be sparse.‚<U+0080>ù An abortion would not only fail to erase her trauma, he wrote, but also might ‚<U+0080><U+009C>further traumatize her.‚<U+0080>ùBecause many immigrants are sexually assaulted in their home countries or on the journey through Central America and Mexico to the southern border, cases like Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s are likely to recur.A Gallup poll this year showed that 18 percent of Americans believe that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, a share that has not changed significantly for many years. Half of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances and 29 percent said it should always be legal, according to the poll.The House recently passed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, a measure the White House supports, but it contains an exception for cases of rape. It is unlikely to pass the Senate, where most Democrats and some Republicans generally oppose new laws restricting abortions.KABUL, Afghanistan ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Taliban on Sunday denied an assertion by a freed Canadian hostage that his American wife had been raped during their five years of captivity and that their infant had been killed by the Haqqani network, a brutal arm of the Afghan insurgency.The militants said the child had died during a miscarriage.Soon after arriving in Toronto on Friday with his wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their three children, the former captive, Joshua Boyle, said she had been raped by members of the Haqqani network.He also said the network had authorized ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the murder of my infant daughter,‚<U+0080>ù their fourth child. Ms. Coleman was pregnant when the couple were abducted in 2012 while traveling in Afghanistan.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, rejected the accusations of rape as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fabricated claims‚<U+0080>ù fed to Mr. Boyle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From the beginning up to their freedom, the wife and the husband were not separated even for a few minutes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the reason for that was to avoid any suspicions,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman said by telephone.When Ms. Coleman was about to deliver the child, Mr. Mujahid said, there were no doctors in the area where they were being held.‚<U+0080><U+009C>One female child was naturally miscarried,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mujahid said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No one has intentionally killed the child or carried out any other abuse on them. If that was our plan, they would not have gone home with three children.‚<U+0080>ùMany questions about the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s travels to Afghanistan, their captivity and their eventual release remain unanswered. Several members of the Taliban leadership reached by phone repeated the lines put out in their statement without offering new details.Mr. Mujahid also declined to talk about how the couple had been freed, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>only the few people guarding them‚<U+0080>ù had details of the release and that he was still trying to reach those people.Pakistani officials have said that the family was freed in northwestern tribal areas of the country after their forces acted on intelligence provided to them by the United States.At a news conference, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman for the Pakistani military, said its forces had managed to trace the vehicle carrying the hostages within five hours of a tip from the United States, and had rescued the hostages after blowing out the vehicle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tires. The captors ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fled on foot,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Boyle, in a video message posted by the Pakistani military soon after their freedom, effusively thanked the Pakistani military for a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tremendously professional operation,‚<U+0080>ù and said the military and intelligence forces ‚<U+0080><U+009C>got between the car and the criminals to make sure the prisoners were safe and that my family was safe.‚<U+0080>ùAmerican officials have expressed gratitude to Pakistan for the release, and President Trump called it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a positive moment‚<U+0080>ù in the countries‚<U+0080><U+0099> relationship. The release came as pressure by the Trump administration seemed to be mounting on Pakistan for its ties to the Afghan insurgency.American officials have said repercussions could be severe if Pakistan failed to curtail its support for the Afghan insurgency, and in particular, continue to allow a haven for its leaders, including the Haqqanis.But Afghan officials in Kabul viewed the hostage release as an old Pakistani trick of offering the United States a concession each time the pressure builds. A senior Afghan official said that two and a half years ago, its intelligence service had concluded that the family had been moved across the border into Pakistan, and that the information had been shared with the Americans.In recent years, the Haqqani network has become increasingly integrated with the mainstream Taliban. The network‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, serves as the Taliban‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy supreme leader and has played an important role in the insurgency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s military victories.But the network still maintains its special skills, including hostage-taking and carrying out some of the more sophisticated attacks and bombings in cities like Kabul. The group previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, one of Sirajuddin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s half brothers, in exchange for the freedom of the North American family.The Haqqanis are believed to be still holding Kevin King, a professor of the American University of Afghanistan who was kidnapped in Kabul in 2016; and another American, Paul Overby, whose family said the Haqqanis abducted him in 2014 after he tried to interview the group‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader.Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s persecution of Rohingya Muslims in recent months, which has uprooted a half-million people and been condemned by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, has been corroborated by many graphic accounts of killings, sexual violence and other atrocities.But a report on the Rohingya released early Thursday by Human Rights Watch, which focused on sexual violence, said that the raping of women and girls appeared to be even more widespread and systematic than earlier suspected, and that uniformed members of Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s military were responsible for it.The report was based on interviews with 52 Rohingya women and girls who had fled to neighboring Bangladesh, including 29 survivors of rape from 19 different villages in Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Rakhine State.Human Rights Watch said the report‚<U+0080><U+0099>s conclusions also drew from interviews with 17 representatives of humanitarian organizations providing health services to Rohingya women and girls in Bangladesh refugee camps, as well as Bangladeshi health officials.It found that Myanmar security forces had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>raped and sexually assaulted women and girls both during major attacks on villages but also in the weeks prior to these major attacks sometimes after repeated harassment.‚<U+0080>ùIn every case, the report said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the perpetrators were uniformed members of security forces, almost all military personnel.‚<U+0080>ùWhile Human Rights Watch did not estimate the number of rapes, it said that dozens and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sometimes hundreds of cases‚<U+0080>ù had been reported by aid groups working with refugees in the camps, and that they ‚<U+0080><U+009C>likely only represent a proportion‚<U+0080>ù of the total.‚<U+0080><U+009C>All but one of the rapes reported to Human Rights Watch were gang rapes, involving two or more perpetrators,‚<U+0080>ù the report said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In eight cases women and girls reported being raped by five or more soldiers. They described being raped in their homes and while fleeing burning villages.‚<U+0080>ùNisha Varia, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights division, said the report showed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the patterns that we were able to uncover that provide a much fuller sense of how these attacks were carried out.‚<U+0080>ùThose patterns, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>include the verification of uniformed members of security forces as perpetrators, the high incidence of gang rapes, several instances of ‚<U+0080><U+0098>mass rape,‚<U+0080><U+0099> and the patterns of sexual harassment and violence in the weeks leading up to attacks on villages.‚<U+0080>ùThe Human Rights Watch report was released against the backdrop of growing international pressure on Myanmar to stop the Rohingya persecution.It came a day after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson visited Myanmar and told its leaders to investigate ‚<U+0080><U+009C>credible reports of widespread atrocities,‚<U+0080>ù an accusation that Myanmar officials have repeatedly rejected.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Fortify Rights, an advocacy group, said in a report released Wednesday that there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>mounting evidence‚<U+0080>ù that the anti-Rohingya campaign in Myanmar amounted to genocide. The report was based on a year of research and more than 200 interviews.On Sunday, Pramila Patten, a United Nations diplomat who is the special representative on sexual violence in conflict, also suggested that the Rohingya were genocide victims and that the perpetrators should be tried at the International Criminal Court.Ms. Patten spoke after a three-day visit to the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh, where she met extensively with women and girls who had escaped the crackdown.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is an act and a weapon of genocide,‚<U+0080>ù she was quoted by Reuters as saying. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was a driver and ‚<U+0080><U+0098>push factor‚<U+0080><U+0099> for forced displacement on a massive scale, and a calculated tool of terror aimed at the extermination and removal of the Rohingya as a group.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùDREW DIXON, a former executive at Def Jam Records, who said fending off advances from the label‚<U+0080><U+0099>s co-founder Russell Simmons was a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>full-time job.‚<U+0080>ù She has accused Mr. Simmons of sexual assault.A Brooklyn grand jury has handed up an indictment in the case of an 18-year-old woman who said she was raped by two New York City police officers after they took her into custody and searched her for drugs, a person familiar with the case said on Friday.At least one of the detectives has been charged by the grand jury, which has been hearing evidence since the alleged assault on Sept. 15, said the person familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the charges have not been formally announced.Both detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, were suspended without pay on Friday, a sanction usually reserved for officers who have been charged with crimes, police officials said. They had been stripped of their guns and badges and placed on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>modified duty‚<U+0080>ù soon after the allegations emerged.But the specific charges are not expected to become public until at least early next week when the indictment is likely to be unsealed.A lawyer for the woman said she was handcuffed during the ordeal and went immediately to her mother after the officers released her without charging her with any crime, officials said. Her mother took her to Maimonides Medical Center in the Borough Park neighborhood, where she was treated. The incident spawned both the grand jury hearings and a police internal affairs investigation.The Brooklyn district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office declined to comment on whether the detectives had been charged.Mark A. Bederow, the lawyer for Detective Martins, said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are going to vigorously contest these charges in a court of law, rather than the court of public opinion.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Bederow declined further comment, including on when or whether his client might be asked to surrender to the police.John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The indictment was first reported by the New York Post on Friday.The detectives‚<U+0080><U+0099> supervisor, Sgt. John Espey, was placed on modified duty after the allegations came to light. He has not been accused of being present for any encounter between the detectives and the 18-year-old woman.Michael David, the young woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, said that the on-duty detectives had kidnapped his client off the street and attacked her while she was handcuffed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think a gang rape has ever been reported in the history of the N.Y.P.D,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said.Mr. David said the young woman was weary from waiting weeks for some sort of action by prosecutors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was getting more frustrated by the day, this has been going on for six weeks already, and it just seemed she was crying for help,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crying, she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s depressed,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said, adding that this crime has put a strain on her relationship with her parents, who have been supportive. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She spends almost the whole day in her room.‚<U+0080>ùDetectives Hall and Martins were assigned to the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit, which, about a decade ago, came under scrutiny for corruption. Hundreds of criminal cases in Brooklyn were dismissed after prosecutors and internal police investigators uncovered a scandal in which members of the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit were seizing drugs to bribe alleged criminals.More recently, the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to sweep away the scourge of drugs have led instead to scores of low-level arrests, often of street addicts in need of treatment. Such enforcement is a friction against a countervailing priority for the police: to decriminalize addiction and offer treatment rather than arrest as a way to tackle an ongoing opioids crisis that has led to increasing numbers of fatal overdoses in New York.The details of the alleged rape case have emerged in fragments and the picture remains incomplete. Mr. David said the attack occurred around 8 p.m. on a muggy Friday night. He added that the detectives were in plainclothes, in an unmarked police van, when they stopped the woman and two male friends in a car in Calvert Vaux Park in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn.Mr. David said the detectives initially searched the occupants of the car for drugs and then demanded that the woman lift her shirt.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They said, `We want to make sure there is nothing under there, so show it,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said, recounting his client‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was petrified, so she showed it. She said, `See, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not hiding anything.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùBut the officers ordered the woman out of the car, handcuffed her and placed her into the back seat of their black Dodge van, Mr. Davis said. She was told she would be driven to the 60th Precinct station house, about a mile and a half from the park. Instead, the lawyer said, the detectives drove the woman to a parking lot of a nearby Chipotle restaurant, where they raped her.After 40 minutes, he said, the detectives took the handcuffs off the woman and released her from the van, not far from the precinct station house.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A growing national outcry over sexual harassment reached the Senate on Thursday, when a radio newscaster accused Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office.Mr. Franken, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, almost immediately released an apology to the newscaster, Leeann Tweeden, who said that Mr. Franken forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal and groped her for a photo as she slept. After initially apologizing without fully acknowledging all of her accusations, he then released another lengthier, more contrite statement that contested nothing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Franken wrote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I respect women. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t respect men who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t,‚<U+0080>ù he continued. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.‚<U+0080>ùThe storm that enveloped Mr. Franken in a matter of hours marked a merger of sorts between the harassment scandals darkening the political world and the grave misconduct marring the entertainment industry. Republicans are still struggling to resolve their quandary with Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.President Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and has refrained from weighing in on the accusations against Mr. Moore, wrote on Twitter late Thursday that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued the tweet in a cruder manner: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?‚<U+0080>ùEarlier, response from Republicans and Democrats alike was swift and unsparing. Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the Senate leaders, wasted no time before forwarding the matter to the Senate Ethics Committee ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a move supported by Democrats, including Mr. Franken. Lawmakers did stop short of meting out a punishment on a fellow senator, and it appeared that Mr. Franken would be able to weather the disclosure.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in the workplace or anywhere else.‚<U+0080>ùDemocrats gave Mr. Franken no quarter.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is unacceptable behavior and extremely disappointing. I am glad Al came out and apologized, but that doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t reverse what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done or end the matter. I support an ethics committee investigation into these accusations and I hope this latest example of the deep problems on this front spurs continued action to address it,‚<U+0080>ù said Patty Murray of Washington, one of the most senior Democratic women in the Senate.The realm of comedy, which spawned the charges against Louis C.K., has been particularly suspect, and Mr. Franken, who emerged from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù as a nationally known celebrity, appeared to acknowledge that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coming from the world of comedy, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the intentions behind my actions aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the point at all. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taken me so long to come to terms with that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Tweeden published a first-person account of the incident on KABC Radio in Los Angeles on Thursday. She wrote that it occurred in December 2006, not long before Christmas, when she was a performer for the tour alongside Mr. Franken, then a well-known comedian. Ms. Tweeden was then a Fox Sports Network correspondent and model. U.S.O. tours are meant to boost morale among American troops abroad and typically include celebrity entertainment.She also presented evidence, including a photograph of Mr. Franken, his head turned toward the camera, with his hands placed over Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breasts as she slept.According to Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, Mr. Franken wrote a bawdy script that included a kiss for the two to perform onstage. When it came time to rehearse the skit, she wrote, Mr. Franken insisted on kissing despite her protestations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be so nice about it the next time,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt disgusted and violated,‚<U+0080>ù she added.Ms. Tweeden said that no one else witnessed the kiss, and she did not tell the tour‚<U+0080><U+0099>s organizers. She said Mr. Franken retaliated against her with insults and, she learned after the trip ended, the compromising photograph.Ms. Tweeden said the photograph was taken while she was asleep on a flight back to the United States from Afghanistan and that she saw it only later, after the trip ended.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s funny?‚<U+0080>ùSpeaking on air on KABC Thursday morning, Ms. Tweeden, a former model, said that women were too often blamed for provoking male aggression based on their looks or clothing. She told reporters later that she would accept Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apology.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The apology? Sure. I accept it,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People make mistakes.‚<U+0080>ùAsked if she would call on Mr. Franken to step down, Ms. Tweeden said no, barring the emergence of new accusations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not my place,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Tweeden wrote that she had been compelled to share the story after an on-air conversation with Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, who has been a leading voice sounding alarms about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill in recent weeks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to have the same effect on them that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want them, and all the other victims of sexual assault, to be able to speak out immediately, and not keep their stories ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and their anger ‚<U+0080><U+0094> locked up inside for years, or decades.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Speier and others have labored to force Congress to begin grappling with sexual aggression that has long been a part of work life on Capitol Hill. She testified at a House hearing on the topic on Tuesday that helped draw increased scrutiny of the sort that has already begun to take place in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and newsrooms in New York and Washington.Mr. Trump has also been accused of sexual harassment. Shortly before the presidential election last year, a 2005 recording surfaced that showed Mr. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about women. The recording captured Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and bragging that he could get away with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>anything‚<U+0080>ù because of his celebrity.Others have recounted unwelcome romantic advances and unsettling workplace conduct, including at the offices of Trump Tower and backstage at beauty pageants.Even before the accusations against Mr. Franken, lawmakers in both the Senate and House had moved to begin mandatory anti-harassment training for all Capitol Hill employees and interns.Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story came one day after Ms. Speier and four other lawmakers, including Representative Ryan Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Representative Bruce Poliquin, Republican of Maine, introduced legislation to overhaul the way sexual harassment and assault are reported in Congress.Congressional aides, lawyers and lobbyists say the existing system is convoluted, and has long been stacked against those wishing to speak out against an abuser: The current process requires nondisclosure agreements and can take up to six months before a formal complaint is filed.The proposed legislation would make anonymity optional, as well as require lawmakers to reimburse the United States Treasury for paying out any settlements to victims.While his fellow senators rushed to rebuke him, Mr. Franken hunkered down out of sight, skipping four votes in the Senate and the Democrats‚<U+0080><U+0099> regularly scheduled luncheon.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fellow Minnesota Democrat, condemned his actions and like other senators called for an Ethics Committee query.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This should not have happened to Leeann Tweeden,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Klobuchar said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another example of why we need to change work environments and reporting practices across the nation, including in Congress.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Johnny Isakson, the Ethics Committee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Republican chairman, cited committee rules in saying that he could not comment on a prospective investigation.Republicans, eager to talk about sexual accusations other than Mr. Moore‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, tried to turn the allegations to their political favor. The campaign committees of Republican Senate and House candidates sent out a blizzard of news releases demanding that Democrats denounce Mr. Franken and return campaign contributions that he had made.Lisbeth Kaufman, who worked for Mr. Franken during his first term while she was in her mid-20s, said Mr. Franken never behaved inappropriately in the office to her knowledge, and recalled him as a focused and intelligent lawmaker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are predators on the Hill for sure,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kaufman, 31, said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And there are so many terrible stories. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard them myself. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve never heard such stories about Senator Franken.‚<U+0080>ùRussell Simmons has once again been accused of rape. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.In the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.The complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vehemently‚<U+0080>ù denied all of the allegations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests.‚<U+0080>ùOver the past few months, Mr. Simmons has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault or rape by multiple women, and is the focus of a police investigation in New York City. In January, an aspiring filmmaker named Jennifer Jarosik filed a $5 million lawsuit that claimed Mr. Simmons attacked her during a 2016 visit to his home. He stepped down from his companies in November.DETROIT ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A former Michigan State University dean, who supervised the doctor at the center of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, was himself charged on Tuesday with criminal sexual conduct involving medical school students.A student at the College of Osteopathic Medicine accused William Strampel, 70, of forcible sexual contact, prosecutors said in papers filed in state district court in East Lansing. Prosecutors said other students also accused Strampel of sexual misconduct.The charges emerged during a probe into how Michigan State handled complaints about the gymnastics doctor, special prosecutor William Forsyth told reporters in Lansing. The focus widened after investigators received a tip.The new charges, which Strampel's attorney denied, make the university a bigger target for the ""#MeToo"" movement that has engulfed powerful men across society in harassment and abuse allegations.""We did what we felt we needed to do and it led us to where we are today,"" Forsyth said.Strampel was dean from 2002 until the end of 2017. He supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar, who has been sentenced to prison for sexually abusing female gymnasts.The four criminal counts against Nassar's former boss include fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The accusations also include failing to properly oversee Nassar, whose scandal sparked probes into why the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and the university failed for years to investigate complaints.After a short hearing in state court in East Lansing, Strampel's attorney John Dakmak told reporters, ""My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone. He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors.""Regarding the charges relating to Strampel's supervision of Nassar, Dakmak said his client immediately involved other school officials in 2014 when the complaints surfaced and fired Nassar in 2016 when the sexual assault allegations were made.Michigan State's interim President John Engler said in a statement that one of his first actions upon his appointment in early February was moving to fire Strampel. Engler called the allegations against the former dean ""disturbing.""""Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges confirm our belief that he has fallen short of what is expected and required from academic leadership,"" Engler said.Four female medical students told investigators Strampel made sexually suggestive comments during meetings, including what some perceived as academic privileges in exchange for sex. Two accused him of grabbing their buttocks without consent.One student described meeting with Strampel in June 2017 to appeal a test score and feeling intimidated when he mentioned her age, saying: ""26-year-old women can 'put out' for 20 minutes with an old man ... and in return the women could get the benefit of a free vacation,"" according to court documents.Another witness said Strampel suggested she become a centerfold model and related to her how another student had become a stripper to pay for school, court documents said.When Strampel agreed to let the student retake a test, he said she must agree to do anything for him, which she interpreted as a request for sex, court documents said.Strampel is also accused of using his position as dean to receive pornographic images of women ""through threats and manipulation,"" court documents said. They said investigators seized his computer in February and found about 50 photos of nude women, sex toys and pornography, including selfies of female students, pornographic videos and a video of Nassar performing ""treatment"" on a young female patient.Strampel, handcuffed hands clasped in his lap and his legs crossed, appeared at his arraignment via video feed. A split screen showed him expressing little emotion as he interacted with the judge.Judge Richard Ball, citing a lack of criminal history, set a $25,000 personal recognizance bond, meaning Strampel need not post a cash bond. A preliminary hearing is set for May 3.If convicted, he faces five years and a possible fine of $10,000 for a misconduct in office charge, two years and a possible fine of $500 for the fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charge and one year and a possible fine of $1,000 for each of the two willful neglect of duty charges, according to court documents.An attorney for more than 150 of Nassar's victims said his clients were encouraged by the charges against Strampel.The charges demonstrate that officials are ""serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at MSU that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history and holding the responsible parties accountable,"" John Manly said in a statement.Michigan State has been criticized for its handling of Nassar, 54, who was a faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic. Athletes had complained about Nassar since the 1990s, but the school did not open an investigation until 2014.Nassar was fired in September 2016. He received sentences this year that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life.(Additional reporting by Rebecca Cook in East Lansing, Michigan, Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by David Gregorio)OTTAWA ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Joshua Boyle, the Canadian man who was held hostage along with his American wife in Afghanistan for five years, has been arrested and faces 15 criminal charges, court records show.The charges include sexual assault, forcible confinement, drugging and assault, and all involve events that happened after Mr. Boyle and his family returned to Canada in mid-October. Court documents show that Mr. Boyle was arrested on Monday.Since being freed by Pakistani troops along with his wife, Caitlan Coleman Boyle, and their three children who were born in captivity, Mr. Boyle has described several gruesome episodes that he said occurred during their captivity. Among other things, he said that members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network raped Ms. Coleman and killed their fourth child, an infant.Ms. Coleman Boyle has said that the captors beat their eldest son.It is still unclear why the couple took what many viewed as an exceedingly dangerous trip into an unstable region of Afghanistan during 2012.The first of the events that led to the charges Mr. Boyle now faces, according to court documents, occurred on Oct. 14, and the most recent was on Dec. 30. The charges include misleading the police.A court order prohibits the publishing of anything that might identify the two people who the Ottawa Police say were Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.The Ottawa Police declined to comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mr. Boyle is presumed innocent,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Eric Granger, wrote in an email on Tuesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s never been in trouble before. No evidence has been provided yet, which is typical at this early stage.‚<U+0080>ùAfter their release in a dramatic raid, the family initially moved in with Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario, about an hour from Ottawa. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Boyle was living in an apartment in downtown Ottawa, court records show.Mr. Boyle, 34, was previously, and briefly, married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of Omar Khadr, the only Canadian held by the United States military in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. He also acted as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s spokesman.Canadian courts found that Mr. Khadr, who was 15 when captured, was unjustly held. He was offered a formal apology by the Canadian government and agreed to a substantial monetary settlement last year. But Ms. Khadr has been widely rebuked by Canadian politicians and others for many of her public statements, including a defense of terrorism.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a dusty, overheated rehearsal room near London Bridge, things were getting ghoulish. On a mocked-up stage set, a soprano wearing a mask with black buttons over her eyeholes was slamming a fake hand into a door, trying to make it look as if it had been severed. Around a table, two ‚<U+0080><U+009C>magic consultants‚<U+0080>ù were huddled around a miniature toy theater, debating what sort of fake mice would freak audiences out the most. Eerie, discordant chords drifted from another room: A trio was practicing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doomed,‚<U+0080>ù they seemed to be singing.It was the fourth week of rehearsals for the Royal Opera‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new adaptation of Neil Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Gothic children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s novella ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù, and no bumps in the night were being left to chance. The seven singers had memorized Mark-Anthony Turnage‚<U+0080><U+0099>s angular, complex score and had worked out where to stand and walk; today was all about making sure that the supernatural transformations required by Rory Mullarkey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s libretto happened where they were meant to. The piece presented an unusual number of challenges, sighed Aletta Collins, the director: Never before had she been required to work out how to throw someone through a mirror onstage, as happens at the climax of the action, let alone how one might recruit a mouse orchestra, which pops up in Act One.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing our level best,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In the 16 years since it was published, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline,‚<U+0080>ù a tale of a plucky girl who falls into a parallel universe and battles forces from the dark side, has developed a passionate fan base, selling more than a million copies. In 2009 there came a stop-motion movie, and there have been video game and comic book adaptations, too ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even an Off Broadway musical. Propelled by this, and by the astonishing success of other stories, such as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sandman‚<U+0080>ù series and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Gods,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman has become something of a cult figure, not just among the Comic-Con crowd, but in mainstream literary circles, too.Even so, the idea of making a fantasy novel into an avant-garde opera still seems like a leap ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not only because of the mice. But then Mr. Turnage has always had eclectic taste: His last opera, which had its debut seven years ago, focused on the wayward life and tranquilizer-fueled death of Anna Nicole Smith, and his orchestral and instrumental works have gleefully referenced Miles Davis, the paintings of Francis Bacon and Beyonc√©‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Single Ladies.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>If someone says you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, or shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, then I think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a very good reason to do it,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has to provoke me, otherwise I get bored.‚<U+0080>ùThough Mr. Gaiman hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been directly involved in this new version ‚<U+0080><U+0094> earlier this month he finished shooting a screen adaptation of his novel ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Omens,‚<U+0080>ù written with Terry Pratchett ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage and Mr. Mullarkey have had plenty to play with. The novel begins when little Coraline Jones discovers that a bricked-up door in the apartment she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s just moved into is a portal to a nightmarish ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other world.‚<U+0080>ù Trapped behind the door, she finds a figure with black buttons for eyes who coos that she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other mother‚<U+0080>ù and promises her anything she desires, if only she agrees to stay ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for ever and always.‚<U+0080>ù Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s journey home to her real parents is not only a coming-of-age story; it also becomes a mythic quest.A powerful, self-determined heroine, Coraline is more than a match for operatic heroines like Leonore in Beethoven‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fidelio‚<U+0080>ù or Rosina from Rossini‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Barber of Seville.‚<U+0080>ù The role is shared in the new production by the sopranos Mary Bevan and Robyn Allegra Parton.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a strong female character,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s powerful; she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to solve these things. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got a seven-year-old daughter. S he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too young to read the book, but she saw the film, and she was very taken with Coraline.‚<U+0080>ùAlthough the opera, like the novel, is aimed at young audiences ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage has dedicated it to his daughter and his youngest son ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it goes to some genuinely disturbing places. The sense that evil lurks around every corner is palpable; there are heavy hints, too, of abuse in the plotline of parent-like figures who bribe a child to love them. While critics have often compared the book to Lewis Carroll, Mr. Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s universe is arguably closer to David Lynch or Stephen King in its atmosphere of suspenseful, what-lies-beneath horror.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted to write about how people who have your best interests at heart may not always pay you the kind of attention that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And people who pay a lot of attention to you may not always have your best interests at heart.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Collins agreed that, despite its fairy-tale qualities, this narrative is not for the fainthearted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The story is: You can have anything you want in the whole wide world, as long as you let me sew buttons into your eyes,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Turnage clearly relishes the material‚<U+0080><U+0099>s otherworldly side; the score, written for 15 musicians, is astringent and occasionally violent, bringing to mind early chamber pieces such as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>On All Fours‚<U+0080>ù (1983) and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blood on the Floor‚<U+0080>ù (1996). But ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù does allow audiences some moments of fun. The composer said he enjoyed coming up with Broadway-ish music for the character of Mr. Bobo, an eccentric old man who dwells in the apartment above Coraline and conducts the mouse orchestra. Two retired actresses who live in the apartment beneath, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, are portrayed as divas of a certain age who issue Cassandra-like pronouncements about fate in high-voltage coloratura.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The fantasy element is so heightened,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Completely operatic.‚<U+0080>ùThe Royal Opera has staged eight new operas for young people and families in the last five years, among them Julian Philips‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How the Whale Became‚<U+0080>ù (2013), based on children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stories by Ted Hughes, and Adriano Adewale‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hatch‚<U+0080>ù (2017), billed as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sensory experience for children aged 2 to 5.‚<U+0080>ù The profusion indicates how seriously the company is trying to demolish the perceived barriers that surround the art form, and to attract new and more diverse audiences.The company is under continual pressure to justify its annual governmental subsidy of around $33 million annually ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the highest of any arts institution in Britain ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and has invested in co-productions with theater and dance companies around the country. It also runs school workshops and outreach projects in towns outside London, including in some of the region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most deprived areas.Mr. Turnage, who grew up in Essex, not far from London, and was the first member of his family to get a college education, said he hoped audiences for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù would come from all walks of life. The opera world sometimes wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t as outward-facing as it should be, he suggested.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A lot of opera directors are making opera for other opera directors, and quite a few opera composers are writing for their peer group,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Although ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù has been in development for over four years, both he and Ms. Collins said that the theme of a young woman standing up for herself against the odds had acquired particular topicality in the context of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The classical world has experienced plentiful rumors about sexual harassment, along with some high-profile firings ‚<U+0080><U+0094> notably of the conductors Charles Dutoit and James Levine, who was pushed out of the Met earlier this month.Mr. Turnage said that, while some things had improved over his years in the business, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m acutely aware of women working in the opera world and the way that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re marginalized, and how tough it is. Everybody knows this.‚<U+0080>ùHe added he was proud that, as well as having created a strong female lead, the production also has a largely female creative team, led by Ms. Collins and the conductor Sian Edwards. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The world is changing,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said.He added that he hoped ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù offered a path forward, in its way. He was inspired by a quotation from G.K. Chesterton that Mr. Gaiman uses as the epigraph of the book: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fairy tales are more than true: Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.‚<U+0080>ùGov. Andrew M. Cuomo directed the state attorney general on Monday to review how the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., handled a 2015 sexual assault allegation against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Mr. Vance decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein even though his accuser, an Italian model, had provided police officers with a recording of Mr. Weinstein apologizing when she asked him why he had groped her breasts the day before.Mr. Vance said at the time that there was insufficient evidence, a defense he repeated last year after an outpouring of accusations against Mr. Weinstein reopened scrutiny of the decision, and also cast light on Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s acceptance of campaign donations from Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are confident that any review will confirm that our office has pursued its investigation without fear or favor, based on the merits alone,‚<U+0080>ù Danny Frost, a spokesman for the district attorney, said in a statement on Monday evening. He said the office would provide the attorney general with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any necessary information.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement of the investigation, which will be conducted by Eric T. Schneiderman, came hours after Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up, the star-powered organization dedicated to fighting sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond, wrote a letter to the governor calling on him to open an investigation into Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is of great concern that sexual assault cases have not been pursued with full vigor by our criminal justice system,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement also came the same day that Cynthia Nixon, an actress and education activist, announced her candidacy for governor; Ms. Nixon, a Democrat, is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the left.Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office is currently investigating other claims against Mr. Weinstein, including that he twice raped the actress Paz de la Huerta. Mr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said the review of Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case would not interfere with those open investigations, which he said would conclude within about 45 days. Afterward, the statement said, Mr. Schneiderman would review the entire matter and decide if further action was warranted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are deeply familiar with Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s years of egregious sexual abuse, and recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against him alleging severe and persistent abuse of employees at The Weinstein Company,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are committed to pursuing a full, fair and independent review of this matter.‚<U+0080>ùReports of possible conflicts of interest between Mr. Vance and Mr. Weinstein have circulated since last October, when a deluge of accusations against Mr. Weinstein, once one of Hollywood‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful producers, sparked an international reckoning around sexual abuse. Two of the lawyers Mr. Weinstein retained after being brought in for questioning about his encounters with Ms. Battilana had personal and financial ties to Mr. Vance: Elkan Abramowitz was a former law partner of Mr. Vance and a donor to his campaign, and Daniel S. Connolly was a former prosecutor turned white-collar defense lawyer.Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers also brought on Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor and close friend of the head of the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex crimes bureau, as a consultant; she facilitated an introduction between Mr. Abramowitz and the bureau head, Martha Bashford.And David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein who hired a private investigative firm to dig up information in an attempt to stop The New York Times‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expose on his client, has given $55,000 to Mr. Vance over the years. Mr. Boies has said he never spoke to Mr. Vance about any criminal investigation of Mr. Weinstein.In Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, Ms. Bashford determined after two weeks of investigation that she could not prove the crime of forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse had been committed, even though she had the audio tape, Mr. Vance has said. Prosecutors judged it would be hard to prove Mr. Weinstein touched Ms. Battilana for sexual reasons because the advance came as the two were talking about Ms. Battilana becoming a lingerie model and whether her bosom had been surgically enhanced.Prosecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to pursue charges, and it is not uncommon for assistant district attorneys not to see eye-to-eye with detectives on the strength of a case. But the tensions over Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision in the case have exploded in recent months into an open feud between some detectives in the Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s special victims unit and the district attorney.For detectives, assembling enough evidence to establish that it is probable someone committed a crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known in law as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>probable cause‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is enough to make an arrest. Prosecutors, however, must take things further and prove every element of the crime in court, and that can often be a much higher bar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The police have a job to do, and we have a job to do, and they are very different jobs,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Vance said in an interview Monday night. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our job is to ensure that any case that we bring has proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard we have to meet in court. Any other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes. If you are trying cases where you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have the proof, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not going to be a satisfactory outcome for the survivor.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Vance also issued a joint statement with the police commissioner, James P. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Neill, in which he called his office and the Police Department ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fully committed partners in the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>From time to time we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have our disagreements, but we will never allow them to undermine this shared endeavor,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.Since its inception a quarter century ago, the independent city agency that investigates allegations of police abuse in New York City has done nothing more with complaints about sexual misconduct than send them to the Police Department. In the 18 months ending last June, 117 such allegations were funneled to the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internal Affairs Bureau, where findings remain hidden and any discipline of officers is cloaked in administrative secrecy.Now, however, as allegations about a wide spectrum of sexual misconduct ‚<U+0080><U+0094> from inappropriate comments to workplace coercion to sexual abuse and rape ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are roiling the country, the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, has added a layer of oversight to allegations of sexual harassment and abuse in policing.In a board meeting on Wednesday it adopted  a resolution from its staff to immediately investigate certain allegations of sexual misconduct by officers against civilians, such as lewd comments or gestures, snapping unwanted photographs or sexually humiliating or ticketing civilians if they rebuff flirtations like a blown kiss. The vote was unanimous, with three board members appointed by the police commissioner joining seven others appointed by the mayor or City Council.Later, it hopes to broaden that mandate and select a group of specially trained, senior investigators to handle the most serious allegations, including rape, though not before it builds up a budget and some expertise in helping survivors of traumatic sexual violence by officers.That next phase must be done carefully, to ensure that, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the procedures we put in place do not negatively impact the complainants and also don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t impact potential criminal investigations,‚<U+0080>ù Jonathan Darche, the executive director of the board, told board members at the meeting.In a memo outlining its rationale, the staff of the agency said there is little in the arena of abuse by sworn, armed law enforcement officers that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>undermines society‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confidence in the police more than an officer who wields the badge as a tool of sexual intimidation and coercion.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unfortunately,‚<U+0080>ù it went on, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the question is not whether such misconduct occurs. Rather, C.C.R.B. must investigate how often it occurs and what can be done to stop it.‚<U+0080>ùOutside watchdogs of the New York City police immediately embraced the idea as necessary and long overdue. The C.C.R.B. was formed in 1993 with a mandate by the City Charter to investigate four types of misconduct allegations: force; abuse of authority; discourtesy; and offensive language. It said in its memo that allegations of sexual misconduct by officers fall clearly under its power to look into cases of officers abusing their authority, though some cases might also involve discourtesy, offensive language or force.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s any surprise here, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s that the C.C.R.B. is only now getting to the point where it recognizes that sexual harassment by N.Y.P.D. officers is something the board has to be dealing with,‚<U+0080>ù Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the board before its vote, in Lower Manhattan. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I am glad you are confronting it now.‚<U+0080>ùFor allegations of criminal sexual conduct, the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo called for a new policy allowing the board to notify the appropriate district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a step beyond its current practice of only notifying the Internal Affairs Bureau ‚<U+0080><U+0094> though it said the high burden of proof in such cases means prosecutors often cannot or will not pursue them.Andrew Case, a lawyer who was a spokesman for the review board, said he worries ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that if these cases, particularly forcible assaults, fall to C.C.R.B., then that would be a sign that D.A.s are not doing all they can to investigate truly criminal acts.‚<U+0080>ùNew York state law does not explicitly forbid sexual contact between police officers and people in their custody, though it forbids such conduct by correction and parole officers. The New York State Assembly last week passed legislation to prevent police officers from escaping legal consequences of an alleged sexual assault by saying arrestees consented, and the State Senate is now considering the same measure. The New York City Council is also considering legislation that would make it a misdemeanor crime for police officers to have sexual contact with people in custody.The 117 allegations of sexual misconduct the board referred to the Internal Affairs Bureau between January 2016 and June ‚<U+0080><U+009C>included a variety of allegations, from catcalls and sexual propositions to unwanted touching and rape,‚<U+0080>ù the memo said. It summarized three of them to provide a range of cases the board receives.In one, a woman questioned by a Bronx detective in 2014, at a shooting scene, went on to repeatedly encounter the same man around the neighborhood ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and recalled that he would regularly lick his lips and make lewd expressions toward her,‚<U+0080>ù the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo said. In 2016, as she was held in a station house jail cell on a driving charge, the same detective entered her cell and made a profane gesture and a reference to oral sex.In another, a man alleged that an officer twice squeezed his genitals during a frisk last year that followed a street stop for jaywalking.The Police Department declined to answer questions about any discipline handed down to officers in the 117 complaints referred to its Internal Affairs Bureau, how the cases were decided or what the complaints alleged. It said it would work with the review board to implement the new procedure.For all review board referrals to the Internal Affairs Bureau, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a huge issue‚<U+0080>ù is that the police ‚<U+0080><U+009C>don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t tell us what happens with any of them,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Case said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One of the things this speaks to, a broader issue, is reporting from I.A.B. to C.C.R.B. about all referrals.‚<U+0080>ùWASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has argued for weeks that Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, should leave the race, said on Sunday that he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>going to let the people of Alabama make the call.‚<U+0080>ùAsked during an appearance on ABC News‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This Week‚<U+0080>ù whether he thought Mr. Moore, who has been accused of preying on teenage girls, should be in the Senate, Mr. Connell said the decision should be left to the Dec. 12 special election.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This election has been going on a long time,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There has been a lot of discussion about it. They are going to make the decision a week from Tuesday.‚<U+0080>ùIn the past, Mr. McConnell had said that he was looking at drafting a write-in candidate for the election, and that if Mr. Moore, a Republican, won the race, he would support a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the allegations against him.But on Sunday, Mr. McConnell seemed to accept that Mr. Moore, who has denied the allegations, would not be stepping down with only days remaining before the vote.Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Mr. McConnell, said the senator was not backing down from any earlier comments about Mr. Moore. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The leader did not change or retract any of his previous statements,‚<U+0080>ù she said in an email on Sunday.Mr. McConnell told ABC News that he still believed that the Ethics Committee should investigate the allegations against Mr. Moore.Several women have accused Mr. Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior. They said they had been subjected to groping, forcible kissing or other unwanted advances when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor in his 30s.Mr. McConnell noted on Sunday that two decades ago, when he was the chairman of the Ethics Committee, he had recommended the expulsion of Senator Bob Packwood, the powerful Oregon Republican, who resigned in 1995 after he was accused of sexual harassment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Senate has been very sensitive to these matters for a long time, and the Senate Ethics Committee will handle this in the regular order way that we do this in the Senate,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m confident they will come up with the right conclusion.‚<U+0080>ùA prominent donor to the Democratic Party says she is considering withdrawing support for senators who urged their colleague Al Franken to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct.The donor, Susie Tompkins Buell, has been one of the Democratic Party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most generous supporters for decades. In particular, she has been a champion of female politicians, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Maria Cantwell of Washington.Last month, those senators were among the dozens who called for Mr. Franken to resign from the Senate after at least six women accused him of sexual harassment or misconduct, such as forcible kissing and groping.Mr. Franken announced his resignation on Dec. 7 before the Senate Ethics Committee had completed a review of the accusations, which he disputed.Before he was elected to the Senate to represent Minnesota in 2008, Mr. Franken, a Democrat, was a well-known comedian and a cast member on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live.‚<U+0080>ù After he resigned, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith of Minnesota was named as his replacement.Ms. Buell said in a text message on Saturday that withdrawing support from the senators who called for his resignation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an option‚<U+0080>ù she was considering.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In my gut they moved too fast,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote, adding that Mr. Franken ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was never given his chance to tell his side of the story.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me this is dangerous and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a big believer in helping more women into the political system but this has given me an opportunity to rethink of how I can best help my party.‚<U+0080>ùShe is a friend of Hillary Clinton‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and has spoken in support of Ms. Gillibrand, who led the charge in the Senate to urge Mr. Franken to leave.In her text, Ms. Buell said she did not know Mr. Franken personally but had met him a couple of times and was impressed by his work as a senator.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As for Gillibrand, unfortunately, I believe she miscalculated and has shot herself in the foot,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have supported her for many years. Will I going forward? To be determined.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Buell, of San Francisco, was a founder of the clothing brand Esprit and has spent decades fund-raising and donating millions of dollars for liberal causes and candidates. Her Susie Tompkins Buell Foundation has awarded grants to organizations supporting climate change education, a free press and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights.In 2016, Ms. Buell contributed money to help a woman who had accused President Trump of harassment, she said, adding that the money was not used and was refunded. The New York Times reported last month that she was said to have donated $500,000 to support accusers, but Ms. Buell would not confirm the amount.Her comments about the senators who called for Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation were reported by BuzzFeed.A spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand did not respond directly to Ms. Buell but pointed to the senator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook post on Dec. 6, in which she urged Mr. Franken to resign.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have to rise to the occasion, and not shrink away from it, even when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard, especially when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is what this larger moment is about. So, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on Senator Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. Enough is enough. The women who have come forward are brave and I believe them.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Gillibrand added that the allegations against Mr. Franken were not equal to the harassment and assault accusations against the Hollywood filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, the Alabama politician Roy S. Moore and Mr. Trump. She has called for Mr. Trump to resign. In response, he wrote in a tweet that she was a lightweight ‚<U+0080><U+009C>who would come to my office ‚<U+0080><U+0098>begging‚<U+0080><U+0099> for campaign contributions not so long ago.‚<U+0080>ùThis past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Steven Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new movie, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Crown‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life with quick, grim strokes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ostensibly because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a suicide risk ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s who and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t belong in the hospital but doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help her case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Carrie‚<U+0080>ù) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Shining,‚<U+0080>ù another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich√©s and sadism and just read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crickets‚<U+0080>ù is slang for critics, but maybe the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.BOSTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A state senator's husband was indicted Thursday on charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos without consent and criminal lewdness.The indictment of Bryon Hefner, the husband of Democratic Sen. Stanley Rosenberg, came months after The Boston Globe reported on allegations that Hefner sexually harassed or abused several men, some of whom had business before the Legislature.Prosecutors said Hefner sexually assaulted three victims between 2014 and 2016. They said he also obtained nude and partially nude photos of another victim without that victim's knowledge and sent or showed the photos to other people.""Today's indictments on multiple felony charges send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,"" Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. ""I want to thank the victims who have come forward and put their trust in us.""Hefner's attorney said he ""intends to plead not guilty and looks forward to contesting the evidence and confronting the witnesses against him in a court of law.""Hefner is set to be arraigned on April 24 in Suffolk Superior Court, prosecutors said.Rosenberg, who is separated from Hefner, said these are ""serious charges.""""They are now being handled by the judicial system,"" he said in a statement. ""I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.""Rosenberg, who's in his late 60s, announced in January that he had separated from Hefner, who's 30, and that Hefner had entered treatment for alcohol dependency.Democratic state Senate President Harriette Chandler, who replaced Rosenberg as president, called the charges ""deeply disturbing.""""Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the District Attorney and Attorney General's Office,"" she said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, both Republicans, said they ""commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.""The initial reports that several men had accused Hefner of sexual assault or harassment sent the chamber into turmoil late last year, resulting in Rosenberg's decision to step down.The Senate Ethics Committee voted to hire a Boston law firm to independently investigate whether Rosenberg violated any Senate rules in connection with the allegations. That probe is ongoing.Rosenberg, a state senator since 1991, had initially hoped to return as president once the investigation was completed, but pressure mounted on senators to move on after the Globe subsequently reported that Hefner had involved himself in matters before the Senate. That included having access to Rosenberg's email account, despite Rosenberg's earlier promise to keep a ""firewall"" between his professional and personal lives.A lawyer for Hefner said at the time that Hefner ""did not have independent access to his husband's official email.""Rosenberg has repeatedly said that Hefner did not influence his actions and decisions as Senate president.Rosenberg assumed the top leadership post in January 2015. He was the first openly gay leader of either legislative chamber in Massachusetts.Democratic state Sen. Karen Spilka last week announced that she had secured commitments from enough of her colleagues to become the next Senate president, essentially ending any hope of Rosenberg's return as president. Rosenberg continues to serve as senator.When Chandler, who's 80, took over after Rosenberg's decision to step down, she said she intended to serve as president only through the remainder of this year.___Associated Press writers Bob Salsberg and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.OKLAHOMA CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed Wednesday that it is looking into a lawsuit's allegations that a middle school student was sexually assaulted and threatened by classmates over 18 months and that school officials did nothing to stop the attacks.The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Oklahoma City by the now 14-year-old boy and his parents, alleges that Superintendent A.J. Brewer and Principal Stuart McPherson of Washington Public Schools, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City treated the assaults as ""horseplay"" or ""accidental touching.""The OSBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations should be finished soon, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.""We should have our reports completed in a few weeks. We will then hand it over to the district attorney. The DA will then determine how to proceed,"" and whether criminal charges are warranted, Brown said.School attorney Andy Fugitt said Wednesday that he was aware of the lawsuit but that he could not comment on pending litigation.Under Oklahoma law, anyone who suspects a child under the age of 18 is being abused is required to report the suspicion to the state's Department of Human Services.According to the lawsuit, DHS was notified of the allegations in May 2017, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation began investigating in November at the request of the Washington Police Department.DHS spokeswoman Sheree Powell said the agency is prohibited by state and federal law from confirming any investigation.""We don't or confirm investigations involving particular allegations or individuals,"" Powell said.The lawsuit comes after four former football players in the Tulsa suburb of Bixby were previously charged with sexually assaulting a teammate that prosecutors said wasn't promptly reported.The four have pleaded not guilty and their attorneys have asked that the each be certified as juveniles.An Associated Press investigation published in 2017 examined sexual violence in school sports as part of a larger look at student-on-student sex assaults. The investigation found that team sexual assault is often mischaracterized as hazing and bullying and that the violence is so normalized that it persists for years, as players attacked one season become aggressors the next.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The British actress Minnie Driver, who recently resigned from her role as an Oxfam ambassador after revelations of sexual misconduct by staff members at the charity, said on Tuesday that the conversation around sexual assault should be based on a model similar to a truth and reconciliation commission to heal wounds and move forward.Ms. Driver, known for her roles in movies like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù was speaking at a London event focused on the #MeToo movement and organized by The New York Times and the How To Academy. Here are highlights of the interview.She spoke at length about comments made by Matt Damon, a former boyfriend, who said that alleged sexual misdeeds by powerful men involved a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>spectrum of behavior.‚<U+0080>ù Speaking on ABC News in December, Mr. Damon had said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be conflated.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver said that Mr. Damon ‚<U+0080><U+009C>represented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, she said men needed to be included in the conversation about sexual assault because ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no way to move forward unless we do this together.‚<U+0080>ù Use the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>model of truth and reconciliation,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to courtlike commissions set up after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda or apartheid in South Africa, where the judicial bodies were tasked with revealing wrongdoing in hopes of healing wounds.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Women get to be heard,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to metabolize that and then there is due process and then there is healing.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, the deputy chief executive of Oxfam resigned in the wake of accusations that the British charity had covered up misconduct by its staff members after revelations that aid workers had hired prostitutes in crisis zones in Chad and Haiti.Ms. Driver, who was affiliated with the organization for 20 years ‚<U+0080><U+0094> her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>longest relationship with anyone,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> announced last week that she was resigning from her role as a celebrity ambassador. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It broke my heart in so many ways,‚<U+0080>ù she said, particularly because she had been primarily involved in programs that were helping prostitutes in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam to retrain and rebuild their lives. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cut me to the very heart of what I had been involved with,‚<U+0080>ù she said.She added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I needed to send a very clear message, not to the beautiful people that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked with on the ground for so many years who are amazing and industrious, but to the corporation that knew, corporate people who knew this was going on. Who hush-hushed it. Who were not transparent about it, either with me or the people that worked for them, and who didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything about it.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver recounted her experience with Mr. Weinstein, the disgraced mogul who produced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù in which she plays an erudite Harvard graduate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cast me,‚<U+0080>ù she said, because he told her and the casting director that she was not attractive enough to have sex with. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got off lightly with him. I really did,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we talk about sexual harassment, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not about sex, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s about power.‚<U+0080>ùThe inhabitants of the derelict mansion in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lodgers‚<U+0080>ù don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get out much. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s script, the director Brian O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins‚<U+0080><U+0099> birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a measure of this movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insistently fright-free storytelling that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Edward. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dracula,‚<U+0080>ù as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers.Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chilling effect‚<U+0080>ù on campus sexual assault investigations.Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them.In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus.A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation.Under Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations.Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases.The Obama-era guidance, issued in 2011 and 2014, reinforced the obligation of colleges and universities to respond to sexual assault claims and was widely hailed as strengthening protections for accusers amid increasing evidence that those institutions were skirting their responsibilities to investigate sexual misconduct. But it was widely assailed by men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights and conservative civil liberties groups as heavily biased against the accused.In an extensive policy speech announcing the new guidance, Ms. DeVos outlined what she described as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>failed system‚<U+0080>ù that violated students‚<U+0080><U+0099> due process rights and lacked public confidence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. DeVos said in September. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.‚<U+0080>ùMs. DeVos issued interim guidance that raised the standard of proof for accusers to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>clear and convincing evidence‚<U+0080>ù from a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>preponderance of evidence‚<U+0080>ù and allowed cases to be settled in mediation sessions between the accuser and the accused. It also dropped time frames for completing investigations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new policy discriminates against women and girls and makes it harder for them to learn in a safe environment,‚<U+0080>ù said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center, which is representing the litigants in the suit.The plaintiffs in the suit, Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice and the Victim Rights Law Center, all advise or represent people who say they were sexually assaulted. The groups are being represented by Equal Rights Advocates, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Center for Youth Law and the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center.In the complaint, SurvJustice said that the group had not only seen ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a decrease in the number of sexual violence survivors seeking its services,‚<U+0080>ù but also observed a trend in educational institutions not responding at all, or not responding as promptly to its clients‚<U+0080><U+0099> complaints.The group also wrote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>students who have questioned whether they should continue with their plans to report sexual violence given the uncertainty regarding their legal protections and an anticipated lowered likelihood of success created by the policy change.‚<U+0080>ùThe Victims Rights Law Center, which focuses its efforts on rape and sexual assault, said Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s guidance was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating‚<U+0080>ù to its mission and operational activities.The groups are asking that the guidance be rescinded as unlawful.‚<U+0080><U+009C>With each day that passes, this discriminatory policy will continue to cause harm to survivors of sexual harassment and violence,‚<U+0080>ù said Alice Y. Abrokwa, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law.In their complaint, the groups wrote that Ms. DeVos and her acting leader of civil rights, Candice Jackson, made statements that revealed their bias against accusers.They cited Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy address during which she asserted that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>if everything is harassment, then nothing is,‚<U+0080>ù and Ms. Jackson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal of women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fake victims.‚<U+0080>ùSAN ANTONIO ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  In October of 2016, not long after a sexual assault scandal at Baylor swept out the football coach, athletic director and president of the university, the NCAA convened a commission to combat campus sexual violence.The commission crafted a policy focused on educating athletes and coaches and ensuring athletic departments were following school policies regarding the handling of sexual assault allegations. The commission's proposal was adopted by the NCAA board of governors last year .Since then, Michigan State has become embroiled in a horrific scandal involving a former athletic department doctor, Larry Nassar, who has been convicted of molesting dozens of women, including many Spartans athletes.NCAA leaders see the association as an agent of culture change, trying to curb a problem that goes beyond athletics. Others want the NCAA to take a more active role, putting rules in place that would ban individual offenders from competing in college athletics and sanction schools that fail to weed out potential predators. That is highly unlikely.""This is a systemic issue in society and certainly on campuses regardless of whether it's student-athletes or not,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday at the Alamodome, site of Saturday's Final Four. ""On that score, the NCAA and the Board of Governors in particular have been more engaged than any other higher education entity. In fact, we're providing leadership to the rest of higher ed right now on trying to figure out how to deal with these issues in advance and prevent them, rather than just always coming in after the fact and imposing some kind of punishment or solutions afterwards.""Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor and activist who speaks to college sports teams all over the country, is part of the NCAA's commission to combat campus sexual assault. Tracy was encouraged by the passing of the commission's recommendations by NCAA Board of Governors in August . But she is pushing for an NCAA ban on athletes who commit sexual violence.""I don't feel like anyone should be banned from their education,"" Tracy said. ""But I do think that playing sports is absolutely a privilege and not a right. It's a privilege to be an NCAA athlete. To be a scholarship athlete.""Tracy said because of the prestige that goes with being an athlete, especially in high-profile sports such as football and basketball, they have more influence on campus.""And so we have a duty and a responsibility to make sure we're driving conversations that effect attitudes and beliefs and how we view these issues correctly,"" she said. ""And we're not. We're basically saying if you can run fast enough and throw a ball and make enough money for a school or a sports program then you can do whatever you want. You can break a woman's face. You can stomp her. You can rape her. You can do whatever you want as long as you're a good enough athlete. And that's wrong.""And so I also talk to them about, you know, what about attaching eligibility to behavior. You attach it to grades. Why can't we say sexual assault is not OK. Domestic violence is not OK.""For the NCAA, stepping into the area of what it refers to as individual accountability is complicated territory.""You quickly recognize that there are other entities that hold individuals accountable for criminal acts per se or even for violations of Title IX on specific campuses when investigations are completed,"" NCAA chief legal officer Don Remy said. ""And so as we have looked at this we have looked at our role as composed of all of higher education. And how can we in college athletics be part of the higher education dialogue to change the culture. And how can we make sure that student-athletes are treated the same as students who are on campus who don't compete in athletics. Not to create any preferential treatment for student-athletes or to create a negative environment for student-athletes, but to have student-athletes be able to matriculate through their time on campus like other students who aren't competing in athletics.""Kathy Redmond, founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, said at the heart of the problem is athletes are often given preferential treatment and protection by athletic programs, boosters and even local enforcement when they are accused of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. Redmond called the sexual violence policy the NCAA passed last year a ""check-the-box"" measure.""But when it comes down to it, the individual players know that the system will work for them,"" she said.Redmond said the NCAA should use a proposal crafted by the Drake Group , a watchdog for college sports, to guide policy on sexual violence committed by athletes.Tracy would like the NCAA to adopt a policy similar to the one Indiana University implemented last year, which bans its teams from accepting any athletes with a documented history of sexual or domestic violence. IU's policy was inspired by a similar one implemented by the Southeastern Conference regarding transfers.Though Indiana athletic director Fred Glass said: ""We didn't implement it to be like a trailblazer or pulling people toward this policy.""Laws differ from state to state, down to definitions of sexual assault. A one-size fits all NCAA policy that bans athletes with past transgressions would be difficult to craft and possibly vulnerable to legal challenges.""What is that a life sentence?"" said Cleveland-based attorney Susan Stone, who represented Ma'Lik Richmond, the Youngstown State football player convicted of rape in juvenile court when he was in high school.Campus backlash prompted Youngstown State to ban Richmond from playing last season. He sued the school, which had no policy like Indiana's. The school settled and lifted the ban.""There needs to be some thought before you ostracize students,"" Stone said.Tracy said she is not just looking to punish wrongdoers.""We're not just failing survivors, but we're also failing these young men, too,"" she said. ""Especially with our athletes the way we place entitlement on them from a young age. The way we set them up for failure by protecting them from everything. All this stuff that we do with our athletes, we're not helping them.""___Follow Ralph D.

The once-beloved comedian and television star has been accused by more than 50 women of sexual assault going back decades.Only one of those accusations was recent enough to prosecute. Cosby, 80, is charged with drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, 44, at his home near Philadelphia between Dec. 30, 2003, and Jan. 20, 2004. Jury selection is due to start on Monday.Cosby, best known as the wise and witty dad in the 1980s TV hit ""The Cosby Show,"" has denied criminal wrongdoing, saying any sexual contact he had was consensual.Cosby's first trial ended in June with a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict following six days of deliberations.Cosby, who now walks with a cane and has poor vision, sat at the defense table on Thursday for the first of two days of pre-trial arguments, with the defense and prosecution clashing over what witnesses and evidence the jury should be allowed to see.Cosby's defense team sought the judge's recusal because his wife, Dr. Deborah O'Neill, is a psychotherapist at Penn who coordinates a group that helps sexual assault victims. She made a $100 donation to a feminist group at the University of Pennsylvania sponsoring the annual V-Day activities, which include a production of the play ""The Vagina Monologues.""O'Neill dismissed the request, saying, ""She's an independent woman and has a right to be involved in anything she believes in.""Prosecutors want to quash any mention of a 2005 press release in which former District Attorney Bruce Castor announced that he would not prosecute Cosby, and of how current District Attorney Kevin Steele later decided to file charges.Defense lawyers want the jury to hear from Margo Jackson, who they say will testify that she heard Constand say she could make money on a sexual assault accusation against a celebrity.In the first trial, O'Neill ruled Jackson's testimony was inadmissible as hearsay but now he is reconsidering.The pre-trial hearing was due to resume on Friday morning.Jury selection is to begin on Monday, with the jury pool being sequestered starting on Sunday night, O'Neill said.(Reporting by David DeKok Writing by Daniel Trotta Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Trott)A star University of Minnesota basketball player announced Thursday that he would not appeal a university ruling expelling him for sexual assault, effectively ending his college career.The university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action had found Reggie Lynch, 23, a senior, responsible for violating the university code over two incidents. In one case, the sentence was suspension; in the second, expulsion.Lynch played with the Gophers during investigations into the incidents, which dated back more than a year, but he was suspended from play last month when the first decision was made public.At a news conference on Thursday, Lynch insisted upon his innocence and blamed a national atmosphere that is unfair to those accused of sexual misdeeds for his downfall. In recent months, accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men have stirred new interest in combating such behavior.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, people will automatically assume that you are guilty if any accusations have been made,‚<U+0080>ù Lynch said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I feel scared that in today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, this is the world we live in today. I am angry that there is no real way to defend myself.‚<U+0080>ùA university spokesman confirmed Lynch was no longer an active student.Lynch was previously suspended from the team over the summer of 2016, after he was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a third woman. In that case, prosecutors did not charge him and a university investigation cleared him of responsibility.A center, Lynch was a standout for the Gophers last season, his junior year, winning the Big Ten‚<U+0080><U+0099>s defensive player of the year honors as Minnesota went 24-10 and made the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time under Coach Richard Pitino.This season, the Gophers are 14-14. Lynch had not played since Jan. 3.Lynch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Marlene, who appeared alongside her son and his lawyer on Thursday, specifically blamed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the current political climate at the U‚<U+0080>ù for what she characterized as an injustice done to her son.In late 2016, Minnesota football players threatened to boycott a bowl game to protest the suspensions of several teammates for their alleged involvement in a sexual assault. That brought national attention to the university, prompting the president, Eric W. Kaler, to vow a renewed initiative to combat sexual assault.Some sexual encounters are obviously consensual, while others are obviously not. But what about those that are neither black nor white? In the second episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars plunge deeper into the gray area.A woman who calls herself ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stuck in the Gray‚<U+0080>ù is still haunted by her first sexual encounter over a decade later. At age 22, she lost her virginity to her brother-in-law, who is 11 years her senior. The encounter had lasting repercussions on her sex life and her relationship with her family, especially her sister, her brother-in-law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife. Stuck in the Gray struggled to define the encounter for years and now she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unable to conclude if it was consensual. She asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I a coward and a liar who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hiding my accountability behind victimization?

He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an enemy of the state, a man of God and the great hero of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Power and the Glory.‚<U+0080>ù Father Frank Docherty, the protagonist of Thomas Keneally‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new novel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crimes of the Father,‚<U+0080>ù is a bad priest to some and a good one to others, and he certainly knows it. Sent away from his native Sydney in 1972 by an archbishop who found Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political activism and theological liberalism unacceptable, he is by the 1990s a psychologist and a professor in Canada. Under those auspices, he researches the sexual abuse of children and minors by the clergy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew the suspicion he attracted from his brethren in the wider priesthood. He was a priest who ponced around academia all week, dealing with unhealthy and distasteful subjects, and helped out at a local parish on the weekend ‚<U+0080><U+0094> how graceful of him!‚<U+0080>ùFor his 36th novel, Keneally has chosen a subject that is by now painfully familiar to both Roman Catholics and the wider public. The main action takes place in Sydney in 1996 and concerns the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding Irish population. This is a time and place and community in which those abused are just beginning to come forward more boldly, while church leaders and the faithful more broadly are themselves only just starting to reckon more openly with longstanding patterns of institutional failure, corruption and concealment. As he returns to Sydney to lecture on his research, resume complicated friendships and seek permission from the current archbishop to celebrate Mass again in his native archdiocese, Docherty becomes involved in an intertwined series of private and public revelations.For obvious reasons, Keneally admires his protagonist. As such, Docherty is not especially interesting, for he rarely seems genuinely unsure of himself. Whether he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preparing to confront an elite clergyman and his superior with evidence of the clergyman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse or trying to deal with once strong, now reheated feelings for a married woman, his struggles come across as stylized, even romantically heroic. You can be damned sure, mate, that tough-and-tender ol‚<U+0080><U+0099> Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to do the difficult thing, and do it well, no matter the odds.The novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far more distinctive and well-wrought character is Sarah Fagan, the Sydney cabdriver who picks up Docherty at the airport upon his return. Through intensely told flashback sequences, Keneally brings out the confusion and pain teenage Sarah experiences when she comes under the influence of Father Leo Shannon, a rising young star in the archdiocese. Under the guise of hiring her as his office assistant, Shannon makes Fagan feel privileged, even blessed, to spend secret time doing secret things with him. When he coolly rejects her for other girls, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she felt the jolt of this news, and a sickening bewilderment in the pit of her stomach; the extreme sentiments of the rejected.‚<U+0080>ùFrom this brilliant, brutal rendering of Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victimization, Keneally traces out her jagged trajectory through a convent childhood, university studies, a teaching career and assorted vocational and spiritual spinouts, and finally into her very tentative alliance with Docherty. This last happens to coincide with Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confrontation with Shannon himself, now a key adviser to the archbishop in legal proceedings concerning another abuse case. The heroism and villainy that play out thereafter is suspenseful, if predictable. Far more powerfully felt is Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unexpected expression of thanks to Docherty, near the novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end, for a favor he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done her, which has made possible both personal renewal and public justice. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What favor is that?‚<U+0080>ù the priest asks. Her answer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You believed me.‚<U+0080>ùJust one day after Hollywood offered a show of support for the #MeToo movement on the Golden Globes red carpet and stage, a famous actress on the other side of the Atlantic lent her name to a public letter denouncing the movement, as well as its French counterpart, #Balancetonporc, or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Expose Your Pig.‚<U+0080>ùCatherine Deneuve joined more than 100 other Frenchwomen in entertainment, publishing and academic fields Tuesday in the pages of the newspaper Le Monde and on its website in arguing that the two movements, in which women and men have used social media as a forum to describe sexual misconduct, have gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and have created a totalitarian climate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is a crime. But insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression,‚<U+0080>ù the letter, dated Monday, begins. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As a result of the Weinstein affair, there has been a legitimate realization of the sexual violence women experience, particularly in the workplace, where some men abuse their power. It was necessary. But now this liberation of speech has been turned on its head.‚<U+0080>ùThey contend that the #MeToo movement has led to a campaign of public accusations that have placed undeserving people in the same category as sex offenders without giving them a chance to defend themselves. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This expedited justice already has its victims, men prevented from practicing their profession as punishment, forced to resign, etc., while the only thing they did wrong was touching a knee, trying to steal a kiss, or speaking about ‚<U+0080><U+0098>intimate‚<U+0080><U+0099> things at a work dinner, or sending messages with sexual connotations to a woman whose feelings were not mutual,‚<U+0080>ù they write. The letter, written in French was translated here by The New York Times.The passage appears to refer to the some of the names on a growing list of men who have been suspended, fired or forced to resign after having been accused of sexual misconduct in the last several months.One of the arguments the writers make is that instead of empowering women, the #MeToo and #BalanceTonPorc movements instead serve the interests of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the enemies of sexual freedom, of religious extremists, of the worst reactionaries,‚<U+0080>ù and of those who believe that women are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0098>separate‚<U+0080><U+0099> beings, children with the appearance of adults, demanding to be protected.‚<U+0080>ù They write that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman can, in the same day, lead a professional team and enjoy being the sexual object of a man, without being a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>promiscuous woman,‚<U+0080><U+0099> nor a vile accomplice of patriarchy.‚<U+0080>ùThey believe that the scope of the two movements represses sexual expression and freedom. After describing requests from publishers to make male characters ‚<U+0080><U+009C>less sexist‚<U+0080>ù and a Swedish bill that will require people to give explicit consent before engaging in sexual activity, the women write, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One more effort and two adults who will want to sleep together will first check, through an app on their phone, a document in which the practices they accept and those they refuse will be duly listed.‚<U+0080>ùThey continue, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The philosopher Ruwen Ogien defended the freedom to offend as essential to artistic creation. In the same way, we defend a freedom to bother, indispensable to sexual freedom.‚<U+0080>ù Though the writers do not draw clear lines between what constitutes sexual misconduct and what does not, they say that they are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sufficiently farseeing not to confuse a clumsy come-on and sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ùTranslations of the letter were quickly picked up by Twitter on Tuesday, and responses ranged from supportive to hostile. Asia Argento, an actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the Frenchwomen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter on Twitter.On the other side of the spectrum, Christina Hoff Sommers, who coined the term ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victim feminism,‚<U+0080>ù tweeted a quote from the letter and her remarks on it.In France, tens of thousands of stories have landed on social media under the hashtag #Balancetonporc since the journalist Sandra Muller used it in October in a post on Twitter about an inappropriate come-on she received from a French executive.The multitude of revelations in France has led to discussion of legislative proposals that would fine men for aggressive catcalling or lecherous behavior toward women in public, and lengthen the statute of limitations for cases involving minors. Marl√®ne Schiappa, France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s junior minister for gender equality, said that France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parliament would also debate whether to establish a clear age below which a minor cannot consent to a sexual relationship. The decision came after French prosecutors declined to charge a 28-year-old man with rape after he had sex with an 11-year-old girl.In March, Ms. Deneuve defended Roman Polanski, the director who pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl and who was accused by two other women of forcing himself on them when they were under age. While appearing on a French television channel, Ms. Deneuve said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been dealt with, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been judged. There have been agreements between Roman Polanski and this woman.‚<U+0080>ùIn concluding the letter, the writers return to the concept of self-victimization and a call for women to accept the pitfalls that come with freedom. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Accidents that can affect a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s body do not necessarily affect her dignity and must not, as hard as they can be, necessarily make her a perpetual victim,‚<U+0080>ù they write. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Because we are not reducible to our bodies. Our inner freedom is inviolable. And this freedom that we cherish is not without risks and responsibilities.‚<U+0080>ùIf you were dream-casting the role of Golden Globes host for the season of #MeToo and #TimesUp, with black-clad attendees from TV series and films that confronted misogyny (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Handmaid‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Tale‚<U+0080>ù) and racism (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Get Out‚<U+0080>ù) and a barnburner of a speech by a black female icon, you might not have picked the straight white guy.Nor, apparently, would the straight white guy. From his opening line, Seth Meyers hung a light on the dissonance of a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s being the master of this ceremony: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.‚<U+0080>ù Hosts of future awards shows, he said, were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>watching me tonight like the first dog they shot into outer space.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers borrowed a bit from his late-night talk show, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jokes Seth Can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t Tell,‚<U+0080>ù in which Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel deliver comedy that would sound strange coming from him. Here, he set up a gag for stars including Jessica Chastain (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Golden Globes turned 75 this year ‚<U+0080>¶ ‚<U+0080>ù), who sold the punch line (‚<U+0080><U+009C> ‚<U+0080>¶ but the actress that plays its wife is still only 32‚<U+0080>ù).Irony is Mr. Meyers‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thing, and he was deftly funny pointing it out. But the fact remains that the change in the air at the Globes is a recent and hardly complete process.On the one hand, the speeches from the podium were often sharply conscious ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not just the acceptances. Natalie Portman, presenting the best director award for film, announced, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Here are the all-male nominees.‚<U+0080>ùAnd Oprah Winfrey, accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, took the audience to church with a fervent, personal speech dedicated to abused women inside and outside Hollywood. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But their time is up.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers wisecracked in his monologue about the notion that Ms. Winfrey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has played down her political ambitions before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might run for president. By the end of her speech, it sounded a tiny bit less like a joke.Still, for all the consensus from the stage, the Globes still celebrated the power players of a system in which Harvey Weinstein, whose abuses precipitated the current moment, was active just a year ago. And at the awards, by and large, the men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> half of any gender dynamic in Hollywood or elsewhere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> let their ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up‚<U+0080>ù pins do the talking.Awards celebration has mingled with dissent before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like at last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Globes, just before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. (He still took a few digs this year.)It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something else for the usually frothy Globes to be held at a moment when the industry, or at least a portion of it, is dissenting against itself.The unsteady balance was apparent from the first footsteps on the red carpet. There were fewer questions about who the stars were wearing, and more about why. (Again, the women fielded a lot more of those questions than the men.)But there was dissonance, too, in an awards-media system not usually equipped to handle matters weightier than a champagne bubble. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Let me just tell you, our coverage is woke!‚<U+0080>ù said the E! correspondent Justin Sylvester, by way of introducing the 360-degree camera at the celebrity arrival area.When woke met woke, it was sometimes a rude awakening. On the E! red-carpet special, Debra Messing called out the network for its treatment of its former news host Catt Sadler, who said she left E! because of a gender pay gap. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Messing said.For much of the night, though, it was a surprisingly ordinary Golden Globes. It wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t quite a celebration; it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely a protest. (Even the black color scheme ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a visual statement for the women, less so for the ordinarily tux-clad men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> conveyed the feeling of a half-demonstration.) The Golden Globes always pitches itself as a televised party, but what kind?Maybe, as the color scheme suggested, the awards were meant to be a wake for a system of victimization. But it will be a good number of awards cycles, after the black outfits are put away, before we know if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite dead.When the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed in 1993, Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bloody troubles did not die with him. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here,‚<U+0080>ù Maria McFarland S√°nchez-Moreno, who spent years as a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch, writes about the harrowing violence carried out by paramilitary groups that bloomed in the country in the late 1990s. She focuses on the stories of three men who have tried to help solve the problem against enormous odds: the human rights activist Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Valle, who was murdered for what he exposed; the prosecutor Iv√°n Vel√°squez; and the journalist Ricardo Calder√≥n. The book covers their dangerous efforts, the links between the paramilitaries and Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political establishment, and the influence of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and its war on drugs. Ms. McFarland, now the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, discusses below the bravery of her subjects, the inspiration she takes from photojournalists who work in conflict areas and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It started when I had finished up being a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch. I had spent six years documenting atrocities and trying to get the government to address them. But I was frustrated, because all those documents I had been producing didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really capture the reality I had gotten to know so well, the stories of these extraordinary people, who despite horrendous conditions often insisted on fighting for truth, for justice; insisted on being incredibly honest even though they could have easily gone in another direction and all the pressures were in that direction. In the United States, anyone who knew anything about Colombia knew about Pablo Escobar and the FARC, but very few people knew about the paramilitaries, and stories usually depicted the heroes as D.E.A. agents or law enforcement. They were missing this whole piece, these ordinary people who make tremendous sacrifices, take huge risks and often get killed because they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re standing on principle.I started out with the idea of just doing an article in 2012. I was very focused on the story of Iv√°n Vel√°squez, who had followed the links between congress and these paramilitary death squads. He had worked very much alone with not much support, and faced an elaborate campaign by high-level government officials and those in the intelligence service to discredit him. As I talked to him, I realized it was part of a much larger story. He was personally connected to the other two characters in the book. I started drafting a book proposal, which took four years to write. The book took two.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I knew that people were brave. But once I started asking them for their stories in details, I was surprised by just how many risks they took. And when I spoke to their family members, they received threats and had themselves been wrapped up in this and terribly impacted. Yet they had never tried to get them to stop doing their work. In fact, Mar√≠a Victoria, Iv√°n‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, kept some very serious threats made against her secret because she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want him to give up what he was doing. She knew it would break him because it was such an important part of who he was, to follow through on his commitment.With Calder√≥n, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize the sort of risks he had taken. I knew him as a journalist, and I knew he had exposed these scandals and efforts to smear Vel√°squez. I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize just how intrepid he was because he was just so humble. Years later, I found out he had actually been abducted by his sources in the intelligence service at one point. They thought he was going to betray them and they needed to know if he was being straight with them. They gave him this drug to tell the truth and he lost consciousness overnight. He just kept going with his work; met with them the next day and they apologized.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I started out with a very important story about one man who led these investigations and was attacked and then prevailed. It turned into a much richer story when I brought in these other characters and dug into the history. Once I had a broader scope and more characters, I could trace the arc of how the paramilitaries grew and what they were, and how they were able to gain so much power and influence and develop all these connections, in a way I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have been able to do if the book had been about one set of investigations.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Photojournalists, in general, who have worked in some of these conflicts. One of them is Stephen Ferry, with whom I worked very closely in Colombia. He captured the humanity and all sorts of nuances of the reality of Colombia in ways that aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t usually presented in journalism and in the policy world. Seeing someone who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to capture those deeper aspects of reality made me also want to do that.Another piece that made an impression on me while I was writing the book was Joshua Oppenheimer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Look of Silence,‚<U+0080>ù a sequel to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Act of Killing.‚<U+0080>ù He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to show what it means for people to live with a legacy of mass atrocity while the perpetrators are still in power, and in a way that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what was happening in Colombia while I was there.Persuade someone to read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here‚<U+0080>ù in 50 words or less.It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a fast-paced true story, something of a thriller. It introduces you to brutality and corruption in a country at the center of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> war on drugs. It also offers hope that brave, committed people who care about what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right can make a difference.This interview has been condensed and edited.Your book ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Doomsday Machine‚<U+0080>ù is a warning, based on your experience at the highest levels of nuclear planning at RAND in the early 1960s, that an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust killing nearly every human alive could happen much more easily than most people realize ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which is a pretty urgent message. Why did it take you nearly 60 years to write about it? It didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I submitted the first third of the book to a publisher in 1975, as soon as the war ended. Her response was we would only sell 1,400 copies of this book. So I thought, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All right, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s enough for every member of Congress and a lot of media people and academics.‚<U+0080>ù And she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No, that means we wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t publish it.‚<U+0080>ù And that was reiterated a number of times in succeeding years.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re warning people that human civilization itself is at risk, and so many people don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be concerned. Does it ever make you feel as if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re the crazy one? No, it makes me feel that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m living in a country in a very intense state of denial. I was saying to my wife the other day, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You know, if I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know any more than the public knows about the nuclear danger, I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be worried about it either.‚<U+0080>ùIf an accidental nuclear war does happen, will you have the willpower not to tell everyone ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I told you so?‚<U+0080>ù Well, how much time would I have? In San Francisco I would expect to be within the range of immediate effects.You were 30 years old when you wrote America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nuclear-war plans for the defense secretary, Robert McNamara. Is that too much responsibility for someone that young? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too much responsibility for an 86-year-old or a 70-year-old. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever had a human leader in any state that could really live up to that responsibility.How does it feel to write a plan that would kill tens of millions of people? I was in denial. I was part of a plan that should never have been made that was a crime against humanity. I once came to a disarmament press conference at the U.N., and Time had just had a picture on their cover of a terrorist, and I showed this picture from Time, and I said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I want to see a nuclear terrorist, I just have to look in the mirror.‚<U+0080>ù Now if you say, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do I feel about that?‚<U+0080>ù Well, I feel terrible.How surprised are you that there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a nuclear apocalypse yet? I am surprised. On the whole, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been incredibly lucky. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something like a miracle, but miracles, I guess, do happen. Could we survive another 70 or 100 years without nuclear winter? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unlikely, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not impossible. But no matter how small the likelihood is, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m working to try to double it.Do you think President Trump is utilizing the madman theory with North Korea, purposely making them think he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unstable, or is he just a madman? Oh, sure, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very explicit about it. He says he cannot reject first use of nuclear weapons, because you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to keep it on the table. Well, that worried people, because he looks crazy, so people thought, Gee, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not just using the theory here, he is unfortunately making a very credible threat. But since the mid-‚<U+0080><U+0099>60s the idea of initiating nuclear war by the U.S. has been nothing other than a madman theory. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been insane to think of doing that.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re most famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers, which are the subject of the movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Post.‚<U+0080>ù What do you think of how you were portrayed? Very, very well, because I was portrayed by a terrific actor who looks a lot as I did at the time, only better.The charges against you were thrown out after it was discovered that Richard Nixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>plumbers‚<U+0080>ù broke into your psychoanalyst‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office looking for dirt on you. Does it ever amaze you that after carrying out the biggest leak of government secrets in American history, you pretty much got off scot-free? It was a miracle. As I say, secular miracles do happen.ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain By Abby Norman 272 pp. Nation Books. $27.In the 1940s, in their quest to devise an objective pain scale, Cornell University researchers poked an increasingly hot metal rod into the hands of 13 women in the throes of childbirth. The volunteers were supposed to express how each level of heat compared with the others. But as labor progressed and the rod got hotter, they were in too much distress (and quite possibly distracted with other kinds of pain) to grapple with adjectives. Throbbing? Searing? A 7 on a scale of 10?And therein lies the conundrum. Few of us can express our aches and hurts accurately, particularly when we are in the thick of them.This quirky bit of medical history opens Abby Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vivid memoir, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus.‚<U+0080>ù But the focus of the book is really in the subtitle: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain.‚<U+0080>ù She builds a convincing case that women describing discomfort are more likely than men to be dismissed by physicians, but along the way tells a story that will resonate with anyone (man or woman) who has ever experienced pain.Norman suffers from endometriosis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a chronic and debilitating illness triggered by uterine-like cells growing outside of the womb. Women with the disorder have heavy, agonizing periods along with a litany of other symptoms depending on where the rogue cells lurk. If they congregate near the bladder, urinating hurts; near the sciatic nerve, pain can shoot down the legs; inside the lung (a rare event), breathing can be stifled.After one bout ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>as sudden as a thunderclap. A stabbing pain in my middle‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Norman eventually got to an emergency room, where she was handed the typical 1-10 pain scorecard. She was still aching, but not in the original horrors of it all. So she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how to assign a number to it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Bad enough that I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ignore it, which made it definitely higher than a four or five.‚<U+0080>ù She questioned whether she was a six or higher and whether the doctor would believe her anyhow.Norman repeatedly told doctors that sexual intercourse ached ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like a dull pinch, that resonated to my pelvis.‚<U+0080>ù No one paid attention until her boyfriend accompanied her and mentioned his frustration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Becoming a disappointment to a man,‚<U+0080>ù she writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>seemed to do the trick.‚<U+0080>ùNorman is a terrific storyteller with a gift for weaving memorable anecdotes, some drawn from medical history, others from recent scientific debates and most plucked from her own travails. We learn about Sigmund Freud and his views of his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hysterical‚<U+0080>ù female clients. We read about baby monkeys who grew up with emotional issues because their real cuddly moms were removed at birth and replaced with pretend wire-doll monkey-mothers. We learn of recent ideas challenging long-held notions about the origins of endometriosis. Many experts no longer believe the disease is triggered by uterine cells that escaped the womb, but rather by uterine-like cells that originated outside of it.Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life is much more than a disease. She emancipated herself from her family at the age of 16 and sought solace in books, particularly scientific literature, to understand her symptoms. Many doctors chalked up her distress to physical expressions of a psychic trauma.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus‚<U+0080>ù is an important addition to a long tradition of pain memoirs. Norman shares a particular tale of suffering but expresses a common frustration about the dearth of words to convey pain. Any schoolgirl can talk about love, Virginia Woolf famously said, but ‚<U+0080><U+009C>let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.‚<U+0080>ùJERUSALEM ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Polish and Israeli officials met on Thursday to address the diplomatic rift that erupted over a new Polish law that makes it a crime to blame Poland for the Holocaust, a measure that Israeli officials have likened to Holocaust denial.The law, adopted last month over the furious objections of Israel and scholars from around the world, makes it a crime to blame ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Polish nation‚<U+0080>ù for the Holocaust and other World War II atrocities carried out by the Nazis during their occupation from 1939 to 1945.It was the Nazis who oversaw the exterminations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by means of mass shootings, gas chambers, starvation and slave labor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that claimed the lives of some six million Jews. But the role of Polish collaborators, participants and enablers in the Nazi-run system of mechanized death remains a subject of fraught historical inquiry.Poland‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right-wing government says its goal is to defend the nation from slander, but scholars say the result is to stifle inquiry and reconciliation.Last week, a group of Poles who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II added their voices to the debate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We ask you not to rewrite history,‚<U+0080>ù the Poles ‚<U+0080><U+0094> among 6,850 Poles recognized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>righteous among the nations‚<U+0080>ù for their heroism ‚<U+0080><U+0094> wrote in an open letter to both Polish and Israeli leaders.One of those who signed the letter was Anna Stupnicka-Bando, 89, who was a teenager when she and her mother smuggled books and food into the Warsaw ghetto. It was during one of those illegal trips that they met an 11-year-old Jewish girl, Liliana Adler, whom they hid in their two-bedroom apartment at her father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s urging.Posing as Anna‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cousin, Liliana lived with the family ‚<U+0080><U+0094> under their neighbors‚<U+0080><U+0099> suspicious gazes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for four years until they were liberated by the Soviet Army in 1945.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everyone knows that there were those who were good and those who were bad,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said in a phone interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those who were saving Jews, and those who were robbing and murdering them. There were heroes just as there were thieves and killers. Just like there were in every other nation. To say different is harmful and nonsensical.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is it now with all this counting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> this checking how many of us were good and how many were bad? We are not some potatoes planted in a field that can be counted. We are people. Let it go.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Stupnicka-Bando said the new dispute was unnecessary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In recent years, we had finally managed to get some peace and quiet,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like all those conflicts and tensions were gone. How can they be back? How can one unfortunate phrase, one inaccurately written sentence destroy all of it?‚<U+0080>ùOn Thursday, Israeli and Polish diplomats met for more than three hours in what the Israeli Foreign Ministry described as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>candid and open dialogue,‚<U+0080>ù although the talks were inconclusive.The Israeli side was represented by Yuval Rotem, the ministry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director general, and included diplomats, legal experts and historians from Yad Vashem.At the start of the talks, Mr. Rotem told the Polish team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> led by the deputy foreign minister, Bartosz Cichocki ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no secret‚<U+0080>ù that the legislation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a matter of concern to Israel and to the Jewish people worldwide.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We must make sure that historical truths are preserved, that there be no restrictions on the freedom of research and speech, and that the wide threat of criminalization in this regard is addressed and resolved.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the closed-door talks, the ministry said it was especially concerned about ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the criminalization clause, which constitutes an obstacle to the study of the truth and to open historical debate.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also expressed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>concern about the public atmosphere that had recently been created in Poland and manifestations of anti-Semitism, and stressed the need for the Polish government to act with zero tolerance in the face of anti-Semitism.‚<U+0080>ùThe dispute has strained relations between Israel and Poland. At a security conference last month in Munich, Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confronted his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki.During a discussion, Ronen Bergman, a journalist who covers intelligence affairs for Yediot Ahronot and writes for The New York Times Magazine,  remarked that his parents, who were born in Poland, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lost much of their families because their Polish neighbors snitched to the Gestapo.‚<U+0080>ùHe added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After the war my mother swore she would never speak Polish for the rest of her life, not even a single word.‚<U+0080>ùIn a rambling response, Mr. Morawiecki said it would remain legal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian, not only German perpetrators.‚<U+0080>ùThe reference to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jewish perpetrators‚<U+0080>ù infuriated Israelis and others. Mr. Netanyahu called the comments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>outrageous‚<U+0080>ù and added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people.‚<U+0080>ùEven so, Mr. Netanyahu has resisted pressure from legislators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including some from within his governing coalition ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to recall Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ambassador to Poland.In an opinion article in Haaretz on Thursday, the deputy prime minister of Poland, Jaroslaw Gowin, said that Israeli-Polish cooperation had improved in recent years and urged further dialogue.How the law will be enforced remains to be seen. Historians, journalists and artists are to be exempted from prosecution under the law, and Joanna Kopcinska, a government spokeswoman, said that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>witnesses of history‚<U+0080>ù would also be exempt.The Polish government, which has also curbed judicial independence and the press, is feuding with the European Union over the state of the rule of law in Poland.On Thursday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the European Commission, the bloc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executive body, which has threatened to strip Poland of voting rights because of threats to democratic norms.The commission warned Poland this week that it had until March 20 to backtrack on its judicial changes before Brussels takes action. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The clock is ticking,‚<U+0080>ù Michael Roth, Germany‚<U+0080><U+0099>s minister for European Union affairs, told journalists.The tensions on both fronts might have given the governing Law and Justice party pause. This week, the speaker of Parliament delayed debate on a proposal to establish a day of memorial honoring Poles who saved Jews.Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said she hoped the current tensions were a result of a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misunderstanding and not ill will.‚<U+0080>ù She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We, the righteous ones, are optimists.‚<U+0080>ùEwa Junczyk-Ziomecka, the president of the Jan Karski Educational Foundation, which organized the open letter, noted that many of the letter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s signers were in their 90s, and she worried that memories of righteous acts were fading.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried that their legacy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the mutual understanding between Poles and Jews they achieved ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might now be lost,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said.She added that it would be important to study the experiences of both groups ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Jews inside the ghetto walls, non-Jewish Poles in their occupied country.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jews and Poles spent years learning about what is a source of pain for the Jews, and what it is in the Polish soul that hurts,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Their memories complete each other. They can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t imagine that someone might break them apart.‚<U+0080>ùA level-headed documentary lies behind the hot-blooded title of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy: Death, Denial & Depiction.‚<U+0080>ù While there may be no completely dispassionate way to discuss its topic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Armenian genocide ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s balance of emotion and composure helps make its stories even stronger.Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in the early part of the 20th century. What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.Joe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Promise,‚<U+0080>ù a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plan is smart as well as symbolic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.At its core, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy‚<U+0080>ù is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,‚<U+0080>ù one scholar says near the end of the documentary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>History is not in the past.‚<U+0080>ùOn most days, Facebook doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much in common with President Trump. But at the moment, both are in the damage-control business, as they try to get out from under the cloud of suspicion related to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meddling in the 2016 election.Their goals collided in awkward fashion over the weekend when Rob Goldman, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of advertising, posted a series of messages on Twitter that were meant to clear up misconceptions about Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s role in the election. Instead, he plunged the company deeper into controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Goldman tweeted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman was tweeting only for himself, but his comments, which drew praise from other Facebook executives on Twitter, were an unusually candid statement that flouted Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s well-sculpted messaging strategy, which has generally been to stay as far away from partisan debates as possible. The tweets arrived soon after the blockbuster indictment of Russian nationals by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and they were noticed by right-wing partisans, who saw them as supporting evidence for Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no collusion‚<U+0080>ù claims. Soon, Mr. Trump himself had retweeted them approvingly.Mr. Goldman eventually walked back some of his statements, but it was too late. Mr. Goldman had just given Mr. Trump something that looked like a Facebook-stamped exoneration.Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t mean to bolster the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s position.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,‚<U+0080>ù Joel Kaplan, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.It is Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.But Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mistakes have been. (Last year, in a tweet that fewer people saw, Andrew Bosworth, another Facebook vice president, claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marginal, even in a close election.‚<U+0080>ù)In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.Even before Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation had found. He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s favor was not a primary goal of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interference from outside researchers.Some of Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far ‚<U+0080><U+0094> such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would be just as effective today.In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve tried.) But it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform‚<U+0080><U+0099>s problems and protecting our democracy.Once you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve read an excellent book about climate change, which Jeff Goodell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù most certainly is, you can never unremember the facts. Elected officials may be busy arguing about whether global warming is real. But most scientists are having other arguments entirely ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about whether danger is imminent or a few decades off; about whether our prospects are dire or merely grim.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has little trouble imagining it. He opens ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù with a fictional hurricane whipping through Miami in 2037. It sweeps the Art Deco buildings of South Beach off their foundations, disgorges millions of gallons of raw sewage into Biscayne Bay and eats the last of the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s beaches. Thousands scramble for bottled water dropped by the National Guard. Zika and dengue fever start to bloom (so much moisture, so many mosquitoes). Out rush the retirees and glamour pusses; in rush the lawyers and slumlords. Within decades, the place is swallowed whole by the ocean. What was once a vibrant city is now a scuba-diving destination for intrepid historians and disaster tourists.The whole scenario seems indecently feasible by the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end.After this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù is depressingly well-timed, though I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on. Political time now lags behind geological time: If we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take dramatic steps to prepare for the rising seas, hundreds of millions could be displaced from their homes by the end of the century, and the infrastructure fringing the coast, valued in the trillions of dollars, could be lost.Unfortunately, human beings are uniquely ill-suited to prepare for disasters they cannot sense or see. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have evolved to defend ourselves from a guy with a knife or an animal with big teeth,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but we are not wired to make decisions about barely perceptible threats that gradually accelerate over time.‚<U+0080>ùSo we stick our heads in the sand. Until the sand disappears, anyway.To give you an idea of why many climate scientists are so nervous: Over the course of the earth‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history, seas have risen drastically whenever ice sheets suddenly collapsed. And that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s precisely what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening now. Greenland is melting at a furious rate ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by 2040, Goodell writes, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to windsurf at the North Pole ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and so are the ice shelves of Antarctica.Many of our climate reports, including the one that formed the basis of the 2015 Paris Agreement, hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t predicted this. Their authors assumed that the most the sea could rise by 2100 was three feet, two inches. Now many scientists believe that estimate is too low. Some say the sea could rise as much as six feet; others say even more than that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For anyone living in Miami Beach or South Brooklyn or Boston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Back Bay or any other low-lying coastal neighborhood,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the difference between three feet of sea level rise by 2100 and six feet is the difference between a wet but livable city and a submerged city.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has been writing about climate change for many years. (His previous books include ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Big Coal‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How to Cool the Planet.‚<U+0080>ù) He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the real deal, committed and making house calls. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come,‚<U+0080>ù partly built on stories he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s written for Rolling Stone, he visits cities in peril around the globe: New York; Lagos, Nigeria; Norfolk, Va.; Miami; Venice; Rotterdam. He speaks to a great many politicians, including Barack Obama, eventually asking some version of, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given what you know, aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t you scared out of your wits?‚<U+0080>ù (Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s response: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yeah.‚<U+0080>ù) At an art event, Goodell buttonholes an influential developer in Miami, Jorge P√©rez, and asks several variations of the same question. P√©rez insists he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unworried. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Besides,‚<U+0080>ù he adds, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>by that time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be dead, so what does it matter?‚<U+0080>ùThe full exchange is worth reading. It plays out like something from a Carl Hiaasen novel. All that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s missing are the twin blondes in the hot tub.Of all the American cities in this book, Miami seems least equipped to handle a rise in sea level, founded as it is on pleasure, real estate and the inalienable right to not pay state income taxes. (When a local geologist undertook a larger project to show just how much fecal matter was in Biscayne Bay, the mayor of Miami Beach went ballistic.) But every coastal city faces its own obstacles to adaptation, and the problems each one faces are different.Naval Station Norfolk, the largest navy base in the world, may have as few as 20 good years left. Yet it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s located in a climate-denial hot spot in Virginia, and it depends on more than a few climate-deniers in Congress for funding. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Many people in the military end up talking about climate in much the way eighth graders talk about sex ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with code words,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes.New York City may have more climate-change realists doing its bidding and spending its dollars. But the barrier the city plans to build to protect Wall Street ‚<U+0080><U+0094> you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to protect Wall Street, right? ‚<U+0080><U+0094> could deflect water into poorer neighborhoods. (And let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not even discuss the fate of the subways.)It is, perhaps, the world‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor who will suffer most. Goodell devotes a good deal of this book to contemplating their fate. Salty soil has already destroyed the rice crops of the Mekong Delta and Bangladesh. If the sea rises high enough, whole island nations could be washed away. The slum-dwellers of Lagos, Jakarta and other coastal cities in the developing world could be chased from their homes, many of which are already on stilts. The International Organization for Migration estimates there will be 200 million climate refugees by 2050.Yet even countries with means can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get their citizens to focus on this problem. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The average American right now,‚<U+0080>ù Obama tells Goodell, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even if they‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing.‚<U+0080>ùWater simply isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t on their minds. They‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got more pressing concerns to keep at bay.Looking for love or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>casual encounter‚<U+0080>ù? You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have to find it someplace other than Craigslist.The venerable online classifieds site removed its ‚<U+0080><U+009C>personals‚<U+0080>ù section this week, after Congress sent a bill to President Trump aimed at curtailing sex trafficking.Craigslist, little changed since it unveiled its spare text design in 1995 and began to crush the paid print classifieds business, will no longer offer a way for anonymous people to connect for romance or sex.While many people used the site to find relationships ‚<U+0080><U+0094> one of the discontinued categories is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strictly platonic‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it was no secret that some postings were thinly veiled solicitations for prostitution, despite the site‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to fight overt solicitations for money.Visitors to the personals section of Craigslist are now redirected to a short statement about the bill, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which gives law enforcement officials greater authority to go after websites used for sex trafficking, while removing protections from legal liability for hosting such content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any tool or service can be misused,‚<U+0080>ù Craigslist said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking Craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through Craigslist, we wish you every happiness!‚<U+0080>ùThe website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personals section has attracted listings of all kinds, reflecting a range of interests, sexual orientations and combinations of partners. Some users have found lasting relationships and marriage.On Friday, inventive users were already turning to other parts of Craigslist, like the famous ‚<U+0080><U+009C>missed connections‚<U+0080>ù section, to post their personals instead.Craigslist has faced criticism over its role in facilitating prostitution and trafficking before. About a decade ago, after reaching an agreement with 40 state attorneys general, it undertook a series of changes in order to curb the practices.The online forums site Reddit also removed a handful of escort-related communities in recent days, though the ban was part of a broader crackdown on the exchange of weapons, drugs, sexual services, stolen goods and falsified documents.Many survivors of sex trafficking and the illegal prostitution trade have praised the legislation as a significant advance in their fight against the practice.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It really provides both survivors and folks in law enforcement with the tools to hold websites that are knowingly facilitating trafficking accountable,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a coalition of groups that worked with the legislators who sponsored the bill.Ms. Hersh said that some websites known to have been used for trafficking have already disappeared.Some tech companies, civil liberties groups and organizations of voluntary sex workers have argued that the bill overreaches.Though its goal is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>worthy,‚<U+0080>ù the bill may have unintended consequences, Ian Thompson, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a post this month.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The bill is worded so broadly that it could even be used against platform owners that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know that their sites are being used for trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a statement after the Senate passed the bill.Even anti-trafficking organizations are not united in their support. Freedom Network USA, a coalition of groups, said in a statement that the bill would only drive voluntary sex workers further underground.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Consensual commercial sex workers use harm reduction tools such as online forums to screen clients, avoid high risk activities, share resources, and protect each other,‚<U+0080>ù it said.While Ms. Hersh acknowledged that there may be some in the sex trade who use the websites willingly, the bill, she said, will save many others from exploitation.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We work with survivors, many of whom have been exploited on these websites, and so we are seeing firsthand the extraordinary harm that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening to many women and children,‚<U+0080>ù she said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.With passage of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to stay out of the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,‚<U+0080>ù the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a wake-up call,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.‚<U+0080>ùPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And down the road, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s content from foreign governments.‚<U+0080>ùInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s required,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.‚<U+0080>ùWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law ‚<U+0080><U+009C>would almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,‚<U+0080>ù said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re opening the courthouse doors,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>acknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> trafficking‚<U+0080>ù but were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>powerless to act,‚<U+0080>ù Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The big guys can take care of themselves.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.‚<U+0080>ùNEW YORK ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The leader of a secretive group in upstate New York turned female followers into brainwashed ""slaves"" who were branded with his initials and coerced into having sex, authorities alleged on Monday in a criminal complaint charging him with sex-trafficking.Keith Raniere, co-founder of the group called Nxivm, was arrested in Mexico and returned to Texas Monday, authorities said. He was to appear in court on Tuesday in Fort Worth on the charges filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.According to the complaint, Raniere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known within the group as ""Vanguard"" ‚<U+0080><U+0094> oversaw a barbaric system in which women were told the best way to advance was to become a ""slave"" overseen by ""masters."" They also were expected to have sex with him and do menial chores for masters, and to keep the arrangement a secret or be publicly humiliated, the complaint says.The name of Raniere's attorney wasn't immediately available on Monday. In a letter attributed to Raniere previously posted on a website related to Nxivm, he denied the practices were sanctioned by the self-described self-help group.""These allegations are most disturbing to me as non-violence is one of my most important values,"" the letter said.The complaint said that many victims participated in videotaped ceremonies where they were branded in their pelvic area with a symbol featuring Raniere's initials.""During the branding ceremonies, slaves were required to be fully naked, and the master would order one slave to film while the other held down the slave being branded,"" the complaint says.Investigators said Raniere preferred exceptionally thin women, so ""slaves"" had to stick to very low-calorie diets and document every food they ate. As punishment for not following orders, women were forced to attend classes where they were ""forced to wear fake cow udders over their breasts while people called them derogatory names,"" or threatened with being put in cages, court papers say.Raniere left the United States late last year after The New York Times reported the stories of some women who defected from their secret sorority and the government began interviewing potential witnesses. He sought to cover this trail by using encrypted email and ditching his phone, court papers say.He was ultimately found staying with several women in a luxury gated community in Puerta Vallarta where villas can run $10,000 a week to rent, investigators say. After authorities took him into custody on a U.S. warrant, investigators said the women got into a high-speed car chase.The website related to the group describes Raniere as a ""scientist, mathematician, philosopher, entrepreneur, educator, inventor and author"" who has ""devoted his life to studying the human psychodynamic and developing new tools for human empowerment, expression and ethics.""Nxivm's Mexican affiliate is headed by Emiliano Salinas, a son of that country's former president. Several women who belong to the group in Mexico have traveled to Albany, where they were branded, two former Nxivm members told the Times.Salinas has also denied that the sorority is affiliated with Nxivm.Raniere and Nxivm have been the subject of criticism for years, dating back to at least 2012 when the Times Union of Albany published a series of articles examining the organization and allegations that it was like a cult.Over the years, Nxivm has attracted a following that includes Emmy Award-winning actress Allison Mack. Authorities also say Raniere has been bankrolled by Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune.Bronfman gave millions of dollars covering expenses like private air travel costing $65,000 flight, court papers say.The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies.Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive.But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Congress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t able to commit offline.‚<U+0080>ùA similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon.The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield.The bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms.Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Clearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,‚<U+0080>ù said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.‚<U+0080>ùFacebook began to change its position on the bill last fall, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,‚<U+0080>ù Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.‚<U+0080>ùSome large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills.Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.Three pastors accused of exploiting and abusing teenage girls were indicted this week on federal child sex trafficking charges in Toledo, Ohio.The men, Kenneth Butler, 37; Anthony J. Haynes, 38; and Cordell Jenkins, 47, were charged with conspiracy for child sex trafficking as part of an 11-count indictment handed down on Tuesday, the United States Attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office for the Northern District of Ohio said. The three men pleaded not guilty.They are accused of sexually assaulting a girl beginning in 2014, when she was 14, through 2017. Some of the abuse is thought to have taken place at hotels and at Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, where Mr. Haynes was a pastor and used his telephone to record the sexual assaults, prosecutors said.Mr. Haynes gave the girl money and told her not to tell anyone, saying it would ruin his family and his church, according to court documents. He ‚<U+0080><U+009C>facilitated‚<U+0080>ù the victim being abused by several other men, including Mr. Jenkins, who repeatedly sexually exploited the girl at his home, in his office at Abundant Life Ministries, and at a motel in Toledo, prosecutors said.Mr. Jenkins recorded the abuse with his cellphone and paid the girl with what he called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hush money,‚<U+0080>ù court documents said. He also allegedly abused a second girl in March of this year.Mr. Butler, who was a pastor at Kingdom Encounter Family Worship Center in Detroit, about an hour from Toledo, was also indicted on sex trafficking charges involving a third girl who was abused between 2015 and March 2017, the court documents said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three have religious affiliations and knew each other in that capacity,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Tobin, a spokesman for the United States attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three claim to be ministers in one form or another.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges are part of a superseding indictment that expands sex trafficking charges originally handed down in April against Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Haynes, and adds Mr. Butler as a defendant in the case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It takes the three of them and loops them all into one big conspiracy with three victims,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Tobin.The three men will remain in custody until their next hearing, scheduled for January.Allison Folmar, a lawyer for Mr. Jenkins, said on Thursday that he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>done a lot of good‚<U+0080>ù in his community, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but all of that is clearly overshadowed with what he is facing right now.‚<U+0080>ùA lawyer for Mr. Butler, Adam S. Nightingale, confirmed on Thursday that his client had pleaded not guilty, but did not comment further. Mr. Haynes‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer could not be reached for comment.Just before he was arrested in October, Mr. Butler posted a video on the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook page introducing himself as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pastor B,‚<U+0080>ù and saying he wanted to make a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>public apology.‚<U+0080>ù In the video, which has since been removed, he said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is never my intention to hurt or displease God. Let alone you, the people.‚<U+0080>ùMOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Nearly every day, a teenager is missing from Hawthorne Cedar Knolls, a rehabilitation center for emotionally troubled children that sits on a sprawling campus in this Westchester County town.Home to many young people who have been trafficked for sex, Hawthorne is supposed to help heal them and head off their return to prostitution and exploitation. But the center, run by a nonprofit group and intended to be a relatively open facility, has seen girl after girl, most of them from New York City, go missing.People who have worked in child welfare in and around New York City say there is a pipeline from centers like the ones here back to the streets, where children fall prey to the abuse that they were supposed to escape. Over the last 18 months, the state, which oversees residential treatment centers like Hawthorne, stopped sending children to Hawthorne and to the nearby Pleasantville Cottage School. Among the 51 centers statewide, Hawthorne and Pleasantville are the only ones to have faced such severe sanctions over missing children in recent years.By design and by law, conditions at residential treatment centers are less restrictive than those at many of the other programs for children with severe mental health problems. Residential treatment centers are not juvenile detention centers, and they are supposed to provide a homelike experience. Children cannot be locked down, and older children are encouraged to attend programs outside the campus and hold part-time jobs as part of their rehabilitation. But people who work with the residents said that a lack of rigorous, engaging programs, especially for victims of sex trafficking, had made their open atmosphere a liability.Hawthorne was recently drawn into a trafficking investigation after a teenage girl who went missing from Hawthorne ended up in the Bronx with a 25-year-old man.The man has been charged with sex trafficking, rape, prostitution and other crimes in a state case involving the girl, and he has been charged as a conspirator in a federal investigation of a Bronx drug-trafficking ring.Prosecutors have not accused Hawthorne or its staff of any wrongdoing in connection with sex trafficking. But the involvement of a runaway from Hawthorne in the Bronx case underscored the challenges confronting such programs and the risks faced by some of the girls who are in them.The investigation offers a glimpse into an underworld in which exploitation is hard to document and prosecute. Victims often fear retribution or are wary of law enforcement and refuse to cooperate with investigations, according to lawyers and social workers. But the exploitation is real, said Paul Oliva, the police chief in Mount Pleasant. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We had these girls leaving campus, hooking up with their pimps,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Instead of escaping sexual exploitation, some teenagers are recruited by their peers inside centers and group homes, said Ed Gavin, a former acting chief of staff at the Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services in New York City. A piece of the pipeline in the region flows north to south, from the leafy, idyllic surroundings here to gritty ‚<U+0080><U+009C>trap houses‚<U+0080>ù run by twentysomething drug dealers, Mr. Gavin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People think of human trafficking as foreign. Human trafficking goes on right in the neighborhood. It goes on in the Bronx,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Gavin, who now works as a private investigator and specializes in finding missing children.The girls at Hawthorne, who range in age from 12 to 21, have been sent there through the recommendations of child welfare agencies, Family Court judges and a special education panel.The majority of the children return to their homes or are sent to a foster home or other setting closer to their families in less than a year, said David Rivel, the chief executive of the Jewish Board of Family and Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, which operates Hawthorne.Many children continue to run until they feel safe at the center, he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kids are not running away from the campus, they are running away from the trauma and abuse they have experienced, which we are encouraging them to face,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rivel said.To prevent children from regressing, there must be a balance between tough love and tolerance of behavioral problems that stem from deep-seated pain, said Jonathan McLean, the director of Hawthorne.The town of Mount Pleasant has long been home to Hawthorne and Pleasantville, which is run by the J.C.C.A., formerly known as the Jewish Child Care Association.About two miles apart, the campuses opened more than a century ago to take in the orphaned children of Jewish immigrants.About 80 young people children live at Pleasantville, while about 50 live at Hawthorne. The overwhelming majority of the residents there are black and Hispanic children from New York City.In an interview, an 18-year-old at Gateways, a program on Pleasantville‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campus for trafficked children, said she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sold her body for money,‚<U+0080>ù new clothes, trips to the nail salon and food.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I always have this thing where I bounce my way into stuff and bounce my way into this,‚<U+0080>ù the teenager said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to explain why people do it or why you do it.‚<U+0080>ùThe teenager said she had enjoyed a visit by local volunteers who brought Jamaican food, cupcakes and pumpkins, but she said she wished some of the staff members were more empathetic. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Be more open and understanding of behaviors. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t shut us out,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Making children feel wanted is key to preventing them from going missing, said Jim Purcell, the chief executive of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, an advocacy group. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For some of these kids, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s showing that someone cares,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Some of these kids AWOL to see if somebody is going to stop them.‚<U+0080>ùChief Oliva said his department, which has 45 officers, was stretched thin by helping to investigate sex trafficking cases involving missing girls, and by responding to calls from the centers and complaints from residents.To push the nonprofits to improve security, the town began charging them a fine of $250 last year for calls about missing children, he said. (As of October, the town had issued the fine 15 times.) The fines were instituted in part because residents had complained about crimes committed by children from the centers, but Mr. Oliva said it was important to remember that the children were being hurt or put in harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.From July 2016 though June, about 73 percent of the 188 New York City children at Hawthorne were reported missing, a rate that was significantly higher than those for similar programs.Mr. Rivel said the numbers at Hawthorne had been skewed by the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>overreporting‚<U+0080>ù of cases in which children had gone missing for just a few hours, but he did not dispute that the numbers reflected a crisis and that elected officials needed to help. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have a real problem here, a real challenge here,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Last year, the Jewish Board and J.C.C.A. hired directors of security, new positions for both nonprofits.At Pleasantville, the J.C.C.A. added more cameras, new lighting and new two-way radios. At Hawthorne, the Jewish Board began following children in a van on the 20-minute walk from the campus to the nearby Metro-North Railroad station. The board also installed a six-foot-high fence that stretches 200 feet through trees and brush.The tactics have reduced the number of children who go missing, though the figure remains strikingly high at Hawthorne. Since the state allowed Hawthorne to begin accepting new residents in August, about 54 percent of the 79 New York City children living there have been absent at some point, according to city data.But the idea of using highly restrictive security measures is at odds with a strong belief by many experts that emotionally damaged children should not be criminalized.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honestly, their goal is to protect these kids,‚<U+0080>ù said Staca Shehan, the executive director of the case analysis division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But at the end of the day, there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a way to force services upon them,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The field as a whole really doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have a consensus because running away from services is so prevalent.‚<U+0080>ùAdvocates said there was a need for more state funding for programs that engage children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those are the things that get lost in the shuffle when there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no money,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Purcell said.Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, a Queens Democrat who is the chairman of the social services committee, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has cut the operating budgets of the agencies that oversee troubled children by nearly 17 percent since fiscal 2012 to keep a vow to curb state spending.The state described the cuts as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cost savings‚<U+0080>ù unrelated to the direct funding of treatment centers.The state provides money to local districts that negotiate annual rates with the nonprofit organizations that run the centers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Jewish Board receives $419.78 per day for each child, and the J.C.C.A. receives $431.36. The state could set higher rates for the next fiscal year because of the cost of the new security measures at Hawthorne and Pleasantville, state officials said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After a bruising week before lawmakers, big internet companies including Facebook and Google relented to pressure in Washington on Friday and agreed to support a sex trafficking bill they had vehemently opposed for months.The bill would allow victims to sue websites that knowingly support and assist sex trafficking on their site. State attorneys general would also be able to go after the websites that support sex trafficking content.The companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.Under those conditions, the bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act, became an unpopular lobbying battle for the tech companies. Rivals such as the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Oracle and HP joined civil rights groups like National Urban League in support of the Senate bill.After weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill ‚<U+0080><U+009C>will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The bill amends Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, established in 1996, that protects online companies from liability over content they hosted on their sites. Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Removing the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shield of immunity,‚<U+0080>ù said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate‚<U+0080><U+0099>s latest effort to crack down on online sex trafficking is designed for success. Proposed legislation has an unassailable title, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017, and bipartisan support. And it targets websites that knowingly facilitate the work of sexual predators online.But the bill is running into vigorous opposition from technology companies and digital rights groups alarmed at the potential infringement of online speech.So far, the bill, which would amend the Communications Decency Act, is sponsored by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and a group of 26 other senators, including eight Democrats.It follows the culmination of a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website notorious for prostitution and trafficking ads.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Finally, victims of human trafficking are going to see justice when we get this passed, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really important to many of us who have been following this,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. This summer, the committee recommended that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s connection to online sex trafficking, citing evidence that Backpage employees were instructed to delete flagged words indicative of trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lolita,‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>rape,‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>teenage‚<U+0080>ù among them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before publishing the advertisements online.In federal and state investigations, Backpage has successfully cited as a defense Section 230 of the decency act, which says that websites cannot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.‚<U+0080>ùIf passed, the Portman bill would clarify that Section 230 cannot shield a website from federal trafficking laws. It would also impose liability for knowingly assisting and facilitating online sex trafficking, and allow civil suits related to sex trafficking.Backpage.com officials did not respond to requests for comment. The website announced in January that it had formally closed its adult section after the Senate investigation found that employers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>knowingly facilitated the criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls,‚<U+0080>ù but trafficking advertisements have been reported in the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dating section.The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which praised the bill in a letter to senators this week, reported that 73 percent of reported sex trafficking was traced through advertisements on websites like Backpage.However, some lawyers and members of the technology community say that while they support the policing of websites that knowingly encourage sex trafficking, the broad language of the bill opens other online entities to new legal challenges. With the potential for lawsuits, there is concern that websites would begin to actively and pre-emptively delete and police users‚<U+0080><U+0099> posts and videos.A similar bill introduced in the House in April, which would not only modify the decency act but create harsher penalties for providers found to have had knowledge of sex trafficking, has been criticized for being even broader than the Senate bill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It would be good for the drafters of the bill to engage seriously with the nontrivial objections that are meant to support freedom of expression online, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not freedom of expression to sex traffic,‚<U+0080>ù said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor of internet law at Harvard, emphasizing that critics were not arguing against prosecuting websites like Backpage.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried about sites that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t resemble Backpage at all running into trouble if the immunity is lifted,‚<U+0080>ù he said. Like many other critics of the bill, Mr. Zittrain said he would prefer narrower language or the chance to prosecute websites under current legislation, including the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015.And despite the strong bipartisan support in Congress, the bill will have to overcome dissent from other lawmakers and Silicon Valley executives concerned about freedom of speech on the internet.But Senate staff members involved in the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development said that they had made an effort to work with tech companies concerned about modifying the decency act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We did our due diligence, met these folks on a bipartisan basis for months, and yet they offered no constructive feedback,‚<U+0080>ù said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sad that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d oppose a narrowly crafted, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who was partially responsible for the inclusion of Section 230 in the decency act while serving in the House, said the bill was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another example of the technical ignorance of Congress threatening the jobs, lives and economic opportunities of millions of Americans.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This bill will make it less likely that tech companies help the victims this bill is meant to protect,‚<U+0080>ù he said Tuesday in a statement.Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents major online companies, said in a statement that the bill would create ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a new wave of frivolous and unpredictable actions against legitimate companies rather than addressing underlying criminal behavior.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Portman said such criticism of the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language was unfounded. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seems like a stretch to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that he felt the bill clearly targeted companies complicit in trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The alternative is not to do nothing and allow these girls and women to continue to get thwarted in every effort they make to seek justice,‚<U+0080>ù he said.In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday night, Mr. Portman argued that the bill preserved the decency act‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good Samaritan‚<U+0080>ù provision, which protects websites that regulate their content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This provision simply protects good actors who proactively block or screen for offensive material and thus shields them from any frivolous lawsuits,‚<U+0080>ù he said.For Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in particular phrases like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>assist, support or facilitate sex trafficking‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>conduct violates federal criminal law‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are too vague in defining what constitutes facilitation and violation. While she supports modest change to the statute, she said she would rather see the courts re-evaluate their interpretation of the law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s specific language.Critics also say the bill opens up websites to potential prosecution by states, a change that could force sites to make costly modifications to meet state laws or expose them to expensive litigation if a law is changed or accidentally ignored, said Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties online.It is a cost that tech giants like Google, YouTube and Twitter can handle, but that would likely stifle the development of new and smaller websites.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I worry about the next Google, the next Twitter, the next emerging platform that we would grow to love,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. McSherry said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never exist because that platform, that business would never get off the ground.‚<U+0080>ùCHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The young women, many of them from poor families in Thailand, were promised trips to the United States. They would also receive visas. Life in cities like Chicago would be rosy, they were told, and they would be able to help support their families back home.But the promises, the federal authorities say, came with an enormous toll: The women were required to work as prostitutes in cities all over this country until they could pay off exorbitant ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bondage debts,‚<U+0080>ù set as high as $60,000, to the very people who had promised them better lives.Law enforcement authorities on Thursday announced federal sex-trafficking conspiracy charges against 21 people, part of what they described as one of the most elaborate and extensive sex-trafficking operations they had seen. The operation had gone on for at least eight years, netted tens of millions of dollars, and involved hundreds of women who were shuttled among American cities, sometimes every few weeks, the officials said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The women did not have freedom of movement and, until they paid off their bondage debts, were modern-day sex slaves,‚<U+0080>ù an indictment unsealed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Minnesota said, laying out criminal counts against a long list of defendants, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. Gregory Brooker, the acting United States attorney in Minnesota, described the ring as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a multimillion-dollar, modern-day organized crime operation.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the eight-count indictment, the operation was intricate for its organization. Among those indicted were the people owed the bondage debts of the women brought from Bangkok. Others who were indicted served as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>house bosses‚<U+0080>ù in cities like Austin, Tex.; Chicago; Dallas; and Los Angeles, where they used apartments, hotels, houses and massage parlors for prostitution. Still others served as money launderers, putting cash returns into bank accounts, and facilitators, who took care of details like flying the women from city to city.While still in Thailand, the women were usually told that they would work as prostitutes, the indictment said, but the terms of the deals shifted substantially once they arrived in the United States. Threats were made. Bondage debts suddenly skyrocketed. Some women were even told to have plastic surgery to make them more ‚<U+0080><U+009C>appealing‚<U+0080>ù to customers, then ordered to reimburse the cost of surgery as part of their ever-growing debt.The authorities said the women were kept isolated and were not allowed to leave the prostitution houses without being accompanied by one of the ring organizers. The hours of prostitution often ran all day, every day.Officials said some of the women are now being helped by agencies to find housing and other assistance. But their immigration status in this country is uncertain; many were brought here with visas obtained using false information, the authorities said, including fictitious occupations and phony backgrounds. One of the main reasons women had accepted such deals in the first place, the officials said, was the promise of a legitimate visa.By Thursday, 20 of the 21 accused ‚<U+0080><U+0094> all of whom were described as organizers of the operation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had been arrested in various cities. More than a dozen others were arrested in connection with the ring last fall, officials said. In making the latest arrests in places like Chicago, Houston and San Diego, the authorities said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, along with cellphones, weapons and condoms. Lawyers for those arrested could not immediately be reached. Ten of the accused are Thai nationals; the rest are American citizens, the authorities said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Is this going to stop sex trafficking from going on? No,‚<U+0080>ù said Thomas J. Dart, the sheriff of Cook County, Ill., whose agency took part in the sprawling investigation. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no na√Øvet√© here. The notion that we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to eradicate this sort of thing is never going to happen until our society decides it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong.‚<U+0080>ùKat Sullivan was on a plane to Orlando, Fla., in February when she watched ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚<U+0080>ù for the first time, a movie about a woman who puts pressure on the local police to find her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s killer by renting out a series of giant advertising signs.That, Ms. Sullivan thought, was a good idea.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m getting a goddamn billboard,‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That woman totally epitomizes the feeling of just having to do something.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said that she was sexually abused and then raped by a former teacher when she was a student at the Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., in the 1990s. A report commissioned by Emma Willard concluded that a teacher there named Scott Sargent had been fired for sexually abusing a student but was still given letters of recommendations to teach elsewhere; Ms. Sullivan was that student.Because the abuse took place 20 years ago, the statute of limitations has long since run out, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So, using money from a settlement she received from the school, she bought a month‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth of ad space on three digital billboards, each about 50 feet wide, to call attention to the case.One billboard is in Albany, not far from Emma Willard. Another is on I-95 in Fairfield, Conn., near a school where Mr. Sargent later taught. The third is alongside I-90 in Springfield, Mass., near the town where Mr. Sargent lives today.Three images will rotate through each billboard. One points people to Ms. Sullivan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, and says, across a picture of a man with a question mark over his chest, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the truth will be revealed.‚<U+0080>ù Another is a picture of Ms. Sullivan and says: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My rapist is protected by New York state law. I am not. Neither are you. Neither are your children.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said the original design included Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and face, but that the company that owns the billboards would not allow her to use them, for fear of getting sued. Two billboard companies said they would not work with her at all.The three billboards will be up for 28 days, Ms. Sullivan said, which will cost her $14,000. (She spent about another $2,000 on the website.) Once the billboards come down, Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and photograph will appear on her website.Mr. Sargent did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement, Emma Willard said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We commend and support the survivors of sexual abuse who are committed to affecting change on this important issue.‚<U+0080>ùThe third graphic that will rotate through the billboards says ‚<U+0080><U+009C>NY Pass The Child Victims Act,‚<U+0080>ù a piece of proposed legislation in Albany that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges and allow them to sue until age 50. It would also create a one-year ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lookback‚<U+0080>ù window, during which cases from any time could proceed in court. Today, the statutes of limitations in New York that govern the sexual abuse of children are among the most restrictive in the country. Most adult survivors had until they were 23 years old, at the latest, to bring a case.Activist groups have been pushing the Child Victims Act in Albany for more than 10 years, and have made an especially aggressive effort this year, targeting specific state senators. Ms. Sullivan moved to New York City last month from her home in Florida to help lobby for the measure.Supporters are trying to make the act part of the state budget, which is due April 1 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a tactic that would give Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who supports the bill, more leverage to negotiate with legislators. The Child Victims Act has support from the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, but there is resistance to it in the Republican-controlled State Senate, which has blocked the bill for years. John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader, did not respond to questions about the legislation.A central sticking point is the lookback window. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said on Tuesday that any legislation that included it should be rejected and called the window ‚<U+0080><U+009C>toxic‚<U+0080>ù for the Catholic Church. Representatives of the church have said it supports changing the statute of limitations, but fears a flurry of lawsuits and the financial hit a lookback window might deliver.But proponents of the legislation have said that hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t happened in states that have enacted similar legislation, and they call the window crucial. In addition to providing victims their day in court, they said the window serves a public-safety function by flushing out suspected abusers who are still in the community.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The lookback window will help identify abusers, many of whom still have contact with kids,‚<U+0080>ù said State Senator Brad Hoylman, Democrat of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill in the Senate. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>New York has among the worst laws in the country on child sexual abuse. We are an outlier, so this fix is a long time coming.‚<U+0080>ùThe billboards strategy was used by activists in London pushing for arrests in the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people last year, who last month deployed three roving billboards to ask why there had been no arrests in the tragedy.Ms. Sullivan said she was motivated by the frustration that Mr. Sargent has faced no major consequences.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is free to teach, free to coach, free to be elected onto boards,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are no blemishes on his record.‚<U+0080>ùEAST LANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The investigation began with the goal of uncovering how Michigan State University officials had failed to prevent Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar from assaulting hundreds of young women over decades. But the inquiry took a stunning turn on Tuesday when a university dean was accused not just of facilitating Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, but of committing sexual misconduct himself.Dr. William D. Strampel, who worked as Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss at the College of Osteopathic Medicine, was accused by investigators of grabbing the buttocks of two female medical students. He suggested that one young woman leave school and become a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>centerfold model,‚<U+0080>ù investigators said. And he stored nude ‚<U+0080><U+009C>selfies,‚<U+0080>ù apparently of Michigan State students, on his work computer, court documents say, along with a video of Dr. Nassar performing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treatment‚<U+0080>ù on a young patient.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As dean of the college, Strampel used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition and sexually assault female students,‚<U+0080>ù a detective from Michigan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statewide police agency wrote in an affidavit.The arrest of Dr. Strampel, who is 70 and was for 15 years the highest-ranking official at the osteopathic college, compounded the crisis facing Michigan State. It has seen its reputation devastated in recent months as scores of women recounted abuse by Dr. Nassar, a longtime university sports doctor. Women have described a corrupt culture at the university that diminished or ignored the complaints some of them made about Dr. Nassar as far back as the late 1990s. Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, Lou Anna K. Simon, left under pressure in January and trustees have faced calls to resign, even as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigation into the university was expected to continue and additional charges were possible.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another blow to the university,‚<U+0080>ù Tom Leonard, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, said of the charges against Dr. Strampel. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an absolute disgrace.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Strampel ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who stepped down in December from his job as dean, where he made more than $383,000 annually, according to MLive, a local news outlet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was charged with misconduct of a public official, a felony, and three misdemeanors, including fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of willful neglect of duty. Dr. Strampel was jailed on Monday, and appeared in court via video on Tuesday afternoon wearing a gray sweatshirt, his hands cuffed in front of him. A personal recognizance bond was set at $25,000, and Dr. Strampel was ordered not to contact current or former students, and not to leave the state.John Dakmak, a lawyer for Dr. Strampel, said his client planned to fight the charges and denied all of the counts against him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone, any student or otherwise,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Dakmak said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors in exchange for any type of standing within the university or the medical school.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges against Dr. Strampel come as prosecutors pursue a sprawling investigation of the university, which began after Dr. Nassar, a longtime physician for Michigan State and for U.S.A. Gymnastics, admitted sexually abusing young women and was sentenced to prison in hearings that drew international attention. Dozens of women, including Olympic gymnasts, described assaults committed under the guise of medical care. At least 265 people have said they were abused by Dr. Nassar.Prosecutors said Dr. Strampel failed to take steps to protect patients from Dr. Nassar when allegations of abuse emerged. He neglected, the prosecutors said, to follow a set of protocols that would, for instance, have required Dr. Nassar to conduct exams only with other staff members present. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Despite his representation of his (and the college‚<U+0080><U+0099>s) intended response to the allegations against Nassar, Strampel did not actually enforce or monitor these protocols, nor did he alert other employees in the Sports Medicine Clinic about the existence of the protocols,‚<U+0080>ù the charging documents said.The police detective‚<U+0080><U+0099>s affidavit outlining the charges also described a series of disturbing interactions between Dr. Strampel and four female medical students, none of whom were named publicly. In several of the cases, the women said they had gone to meet with Dr. Strampel to discuss their academic work but that he had turned the conversation to other topics.One woman who said she had been summoned to Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office after falling asleep in class said that he told her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>turn around in a circle twice so that he could observe her body,‚<U+0080>ù and that he said that she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.‚<U+0080>ù When she was later called to a dinner honoring scholarship recipients at a club on Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s golf course, she said Dr. Strampel reached around and gripped her buttock as they posed for photos, according to the affidavit.Another student who had failed a medical school test said she was required to meet with Dr. Strampel, who asked her what her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Plan B‚<U+0080>ù was since ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she could not cut it in medical school.‚<U+0080>ù The student said Dr. Strampel told her he would do her a favor by letting her take the exam again, but that she would then be required to do anything for him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given the context,‚<U+0080>ù the affidavit said, the woman ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understood that she was being asked to do anything he wanted sexually in exchange for the favor.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, Dr. Nicole Eastman, who graduated from the school in 2010 and who said that she was interviewed by investigators in the case, said that Dr. Strampel made inappropriate sexual remarks, beginning soon after she started school in 2006.At one point, he told her, laughing and boasting, that it was easy to get women drunk, she said. Another time, she said, he grabbed her buttock at a crowded event, in full view of his wife, who was standing nearby.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I just remember how humiliating it was,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People knew about his behavior, and even if they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t inappropriately touched by him, they knew. And now we know that his behavior enabled Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Eastman said she told a Michigan State employee while she was in school about Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. The employee looked resigned, Dr. Eastman recalled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Everybody knows about his behavior and nothing ever changes,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like a defeated kind of tone. When I think back to that, it was like she felt powerless.‚<U+0080>ùThe charging documents said Dr. Strampel also made graphic sexual comments, solicited nude photos from at least one student, and stored dozens of pornographic images and videos on a computer in his office, including many images that appeared to be of Michigan State students.Rachael Denhollander, who said Dr. Nassar abused her, said Tuesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges reflected a systemic failure at Michigan State.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is shocking but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not shocking,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone like Larry doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get away with becoming the worst sexual abuser in history in plain sight if he were not surrounded by people who had no problem with his conduct and did not think it was a big deal.‚<U+0080>ùMichigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interim president, John Engler, last month took steps to start the process of revoking Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tenure. University officials did not answer questions Tuesday about the status of the revocation, and did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Engler.For years, university officials largely dismissed reports that Dr. Nassar had assaulted women, even though some women said they had reported abuse years ago to coaches, trainers or counselors.On Tuesday, State Senator Margaret O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien, a Republican, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>this university needs to own up to what it did.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just go away,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should know that by now.‚<U+0080>ùOn the campus of Michigan State, students said they were unsettled by the arrest of Dr. Strampel, who came to the College of Osteopathic Medicine in the 1990s after a career that included stints in the surgeon general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and several hospitals.The college enrolls more than 1,200 students and graduates about 300 physicians each year. Graduates earn a D.O. degree instead of the more common M.D., but are full-fledged doctors able to prescribe medication, perform surgeries and choose any specialty. Students also study the osteopathic techniques of manipulating the spine, muscles and bones to diagnose and treat patients.Dr. Strampel, who could face up to nine years in prison if convicted of all charges, arrived at his home outside Lansing after his court appearance on Tuesday afternoon. A woman who came to the door declined to comment.Aly Raisman, an Olympic gymnast who said Dr. Nassar abused her, wrote on Instagram that the charges against Dr. Strampel were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another painful example‚<U+0080>ù of how so much had been mishandled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clear that failing to investigate and understand how this abuse could go on for so long is just asking history to repeat itself,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Raisman, who called for a broader investigation ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that looks into everything, not just Nassar.‚<U+0080>ùAn American swimmer who competed in the 2012 Olympics has accused her former coach of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.The swimmer, Ariana Kukors, 28, said in a statement on Wednesday that the coach, Sean Hutchison, began sexually abusing her when she was 16 and had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>grooming‚<U+0080>ù her for three years before that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kukors said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement emailed by his lawyer, Mr. Hutchison, 46, said Thursday that the accusations were not true. He said that the two had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>committed relationship‚<U+0080>ù that began after she was of age and that they had lived together for more than a year after the 2012 Olympic Games.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to ‚<U+0080><U+0098>groom‚<U+0080><U+0099> her.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her younger sister also lived with us for several months and her mother was a regular visitor to our home,‚<U+0080>ù the statement added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that she would make these wild allegations all these years later.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawyer, Brad Meryhew, said Mr. Hutchison would not comment further.In response to Mr. Hutchison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, B. Robert Allard, one of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers, said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana was groomed and manipulated as a minor by her trusted swim coach. He sexually assaulted her starting when she was 16. This abusive relationship continued until the age of 24. I would hardly characterize this a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>committed relationship‚<U+0080><U+0099> in the sense of two consenting adults who freely and willingly engage in healthy relations. There is nothing healthy about childhood sexual abuse.‚<U+0080>ùThe United States Homeland Security Department is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>still in the very preliminary stages‚<U+0080>ù of an investigation into this case, Lori Haley, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an email on Thursday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But our top priority in all cases involving alleged online child exploitation is identifying any possible minor victims.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Kukors once held the world record for the 200-meter individual medley and has won medals at several international competitions. She competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.Mr. Hutchison has worked with several Olympic swimmers, including the medalists Margaret Hoelzer, Caroline Burckle and Kara Lynn Joyce. He was an assistant coach for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s swimming team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.He met Ms. Kukors when he was a coach at King Aquatic Club in Seattle, according to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement.In a statement on Thursday, Michael Brooks, the head coach at the club, said that news of the allegations ‚<U+0080><U+009C>broke our collective hearts.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana Kukors is part of the King Aquatic family and we only want the best for her,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Brooks said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our staff is meeting to review this devastating news. Sean Hutchison has stepped down as an executive with King and has had no direct interaction with our swimmers for a very long time.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Allard said that U.S.A. Swimming had been given notice in 2010 about the inappropriate coach-athlete relationship but had done nothing.U.S.A. Swimming, the organization that governs the sport in the United States, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became aware of a rumored relationship between Hutchison and then 21-year-old Ariana via a third-party‚<U+0080>ù in 2010. (The organization said Mr. Hutchison does not work for the organization, but he once had a coach membership and remains a nonathlete member.)U.S.A. Swimming said that it conducted an investigation into the rumor in 2010, but that Ms. Kukors and Mr. Hutchison both ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unequivocally denied the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship,‚<U+0080>ù and the case was closed.In light of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, the organization expressed support for her and other victims ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in their quest to break their silence and confront their horrific experiences.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, she realized that she had been abused only ‚<U+0080><U+009C>through recent therapy and after years of suppressing memories of the pain and suffering,‚<U+0080>ù and that she was coming forward with her story on the recommendation of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates.Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement follows on the heels of a dramatic sentencing hearing for Lawrence G. Nassar, a medical professional who was convicted of sexually abusing the young gymnasts, including Olympians, who were his patients. At least 265 girls and women have accused him of abuse, including while an F.B.I. inquiry into the allegations was underway.Uproar over the slow response to the allegations led the board of directors of U.S.A. Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the United States, to resign.The sexual misconduct allegations against the former Fox News host Bill O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly and the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the confidential settlements arising from those accusations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have prompted a provision in the  final tax bill that aims to stem the use of nondisclosure agreements.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, proposed the amendment last month. It says any settlement, payout or lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse could not be deducted as a business expense if such payments were subject to a nondisclosure agreement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think most Americans would be outraged to know that they are subsidizing sexual predators in the tax code,‚<U+0080>ù he said in an emailed statement.But the proposed changes may not deter some companies and businesses from seeking confidentiality.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a nudge, not a hammer,‚<U+0080>ù Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an expert in tax policy, said in a phone interview on Saturday.Publicly known sexual harassment settlements involving Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who is said to have used nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have totaled about $45 million, including a $32 million payout that he paid personally.Mr. Weinstein, whose abuse of women was exposed by The New York Times in October, also has used confidentiality agreements. The Times reported that Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment.Under the tax bill spearheaded by Republicans, a hypothetical company that paid a $10 million sexual abuse settlement would not be able to take a deduction on that amount if the payout had a nondisclosure agreement attached to it.In the absence of a confidentiality agreement, however, the new corporate tax rate would allow the company to save $2.1 million in taxes, making its out-of-pocket cost $7.9 million.For a business that generates billions in revenue, like the parent company of Fox News, a nondisclosure agreement can have far more value than tax savings.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new rules are very well-intentioned, but the impact is likely to only be symbolic,‚<U+0080>ù Gordon Klein, a lawyer, certified public accountant and faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Anderson School of Management, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The reason for that is companies cherish nondisclosure agreements because they significantly help protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and protect them from follow-on lawsuits or additional lawsuits.‚<U+0080>ùThe nonspecific language of the amendment also complicated matters, Mr. Klein said.The bill refers to settlements or payments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>related‚<U+0080>ù to sexual harassment or sexual abuse, he said, but what if only one portion of the allegations is about sexual harassment? And does it matter if the sexual harassment was merely an allegation, or does there need to be evidence of sexual harassment? Are the lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees limited to the time spent drafting the settlement, or to all of the fees associated with the settlement?Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, proposed a similar amendment for the House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tax reform bill but it did not include a stipulation about confidentiality agreements.In the end, the language in the Senate bill offered by Mr. Menendez made the final cut when lawmakers blended the two bills together. Democrats have heavily criticized the proposed tax bill and complained they were shut out of the legislative process.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the reason, in all honestly, why there was no pushback was because it was a revenue generator,‚<U+0080>ù Tricia Enright, Mr. Menendez‚<U+0080><U+0099>s press secretary, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They determined that it would be seen on the plus-side of the ledger.‚<U+0080>ùWhile the new tax plan would allow businesses to write off legal fees related to sexual harassment payouts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> provided they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not tied to nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it is a different situation for employees who make claims of sexual abuse or harassment.In those cases, plaintiffs will no longer be able to write off their legal fees. A plaintiff could ordinarily claim such an expense as an itemized deduction, but the Republican plan has eliminated that option, Mr. Hemel said, adding that it creates ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a one-sidedness.‚<U+0080>ùROME ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After his spirited defense of a Chilean bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse prompted the greatest crisis of his pontificate, Pope Francis reactivated an abuse commission on Saturday that had lapsed into dormancy.It was the latest in a series of measures by the Vatican to counter criticism that fighting abuse was not a priority for Francis‚<U+0080><U+0099> papacy.Cardinal Sean O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley of Boston was reappointed as the leader of the group, called the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. A Vatican statement said the panel would include some victims of clerical sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm,‚<U+0080>ù Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley said in a statement.The Vatican statement said the abuse victims on the commission preferred to keep their histories private.The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December, and its lapsing coincided with growing criticism of the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to addressing sexual abuse in the church. The group plans to begin its work in April by hearing the testimony of abuse victims.The Vatican statement said the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s goal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and greatest challenge‚<U+0080>ù remained embedding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>abuse prevention and protection into the life and action of local churches.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement about the commission came on the same day that the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most experienced sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, was expected to take testimony in New York from Juan Carlos Cruz, who says that he was sexually abused when he was a teenager in Chile by a priest and that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had witnessed the abuse.While visiting Chile last month, the pope initially defended Bishop Barros as a victim of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>calumny,‚<U+0080>ù saying that the Vatican had received no concrete evidence against the bishop.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,‚<U+0080>ù Francis said at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander.‚<U+0080>ùThe comments caused outrage in Chile, and Francis, amid intense pressure, dispatched Archbishop Scicluna to investigate.On Thursday, the Civilt√† Cattolica, a Jesuit journal, published the private remarks the pope made during a visit to Peru last month, in which he disclosed that he regularly met with victims of sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father meets victims of sexual abuse, either individually or in groups, several times a month,‚<U+0080>ù Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman, confirmed in a statement. He added that the pope ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tries to help them heal the grave wounds caused by the abuses they suffered.‚<U+0080>ùMany advocates for abuse survivors accused the pope of opening up a wound by saying there was no evidence that Bishop Barros had covered up abuse. It then emerged that the pope had personally received an eight-page letter in 2015 containing testimony against the bishop, and that Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley had delivered it.Eight members of the commission were reappointed, and nine others are new to the panel. Its experts, which include lay academics and psychologists, priests and nuns, come from several countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Tonga. Ten are non-clerics and eight are women, including three nuns.Two abuse survivors previously left the commission in frustration. And the pope did not reappoint six lay members who advocates for the abused considered among the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most active leaders.CHARLOTTE, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Back in court Wednesday for his third and final sentencing hearing, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports clinic doctor, heard statements from more than 20 accusers, many of whom shared accounts of sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar at a local gymnastics club known for grooming stars.Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers include elite athletes, such as the Olympic medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas. But the speakers in court on Wednesday were not global superstars. They were mostly regular teenagers who told of being charmed by Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strange laugh‚<U+0080>ù and by the autographed posters of revered gymnasts on the walls of his office at the Michigan State sports clinic.Twistars Gymnastics Club, outside Lansing, Mich., was supposed to catapult young female athletes to a fruitful career, under the guidance of John Geddert, who owned the gym and coached there. Instead it became a site of anguish and devastation, according to the statements, some of which described long-lasting injuries, both mental and physical, inflicted by the doctor known as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>healer of gymnasts.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, more than 150 young women and teenagers finished publicly confronting Dr. Nassar during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. He has received sentences of 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography and of 40 to 175 years for the sexual abuse charges in Ingham County.Starting Wednesday, 65 women were scheduled to speak here in Eaton County Circuit Court this week. The judge, Janice K. Cunningham, said that the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265, some of whom chose to remain anonymous.Unlike the Ingham County judge, Rosemarie E. Aquilina, whose frequent commentary throughout the hearing there was met with a mix of praise and disapproval, Judge Cunningham kept her comments concise and subdued, primarily expressing appreciation for the victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> bravery.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is almost beyond comprehension to listen to young women in high school to stand at that podium and come forward with their story,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Dr. Nassar, wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, remained stoic with his head hanging low throughout the first day of the hearing, which included statements from 29 of the accusers, 22 of whom had not previously offered a statement in Ingham County.The first speaker, Jessica Thomashow, said she had been assaulted by Dr. Nassar as early as age 9, at Twistars.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The way it worked at Twistars was that, if you were injured, you were specifically instructed to see Larry Nassar, not your family doctor,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Thomashow said. She recalled being excited to see the famed Dr. Nassar for a rib injury.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into the back room and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when everything changed,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to the room Dr. Nassar used at Twistars.Another victim, Bailey Lorencen, whose statement was read for her, referred to Twistars‚<U+0080><U+0099> back room as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dungeon.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is clear that in an environment like Twistars, a monster like Nassar would thrive,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lorencen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said.Dr. Nassar pleaded guilty here in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13, according to a plea agreement.The agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011, some of it under the guise of medical treatment. A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars.Dr. Nassar will be sentenced after the victims speak. The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the counts.The case has reverberated in the sports world, and it led to the resignation of the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board of directors.At Michigan State, the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president, after the longtime president Lou Anna Simon resigned last week. But Mr. Engler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appointment has already been met with student protests, and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faculty senate is debating a vote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no confidence‚<U+0080>ù in the board. The vote could come as soon as next week.The stories told Wednesday by the young women and by athletes‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents, some of whom had been in the room while Dr. Nassar abused their daughters, painted an image of a dark side in gymnastics culture. Many of the victims said the pressure to rise in the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ranks had contributed to their decisions not to report the abuse sooner.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I kept thinking, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a doctor, stop overreacting,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Katherine Ebert said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t overreacting.‚<U+0080>ùMadison Bonofiglio, whose statement was read by Angela Povilaitis, the assistant attorney general, said she had dismissed her feelings while she was being abused for fear of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>upsetting‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are judged by your body, your looks, your cuteness factor, and then your skill,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.The young women said that they were told they had no choice but to see Dr. Nassar and that he had lulled them into trusting him. He lit the fireplace to keep athletes warm when ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treating‚<U+0080>ù them in his basement, where the abuse often occurred, they said. Dr. Nassar often gave gifts, such as souvenir pins, necklaces and treats, according to some of the statements.Amy Preston, the mother of a 19-year-old who was abused by Dr. Nassar as a child, said he had brought the girl waffles with fresh berries and whipped cream. He often consoled gymnasts when Mr. Geddert screamed at them, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>John, you tried to teach our girls to be quiet and obey,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Preston said in court, apparently referring to Mr. Geddert. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We now stand before them and say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Speak.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A. sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University, formally opening an investigation into how the university handled the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, the doctor who sexually assaulted scores of female athletes.Dr. Nassar spent decades on the faculty at the university and treated its athletes, as well as members of the United States national gymnastics team.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has requested information from Michigan State about any potential rules violations,‚<U+0080>ù Donald M. Remy, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief legal officer, said in a phone interview Tuesday evening.N.C.A.A. bylaws require colleges to protect the health, safety and well-being of athletes. Among those who have said Dr. Nassar abused them are members of the Michigan State cross country and softball teams. Kathie Klages, the former gymnastics coach who retired last year, has been accused of seeking to cover up allegations against Dr. Nassar, who served as team physician for the university gymnastics and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crew programs.In a statement late Tuesday, the association said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential N.C.A.A. rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State. We will have no further comment at this time.‚<U+0080>ùA Michigan State spokesman said Tuesday night that the university was reviewing the letter before issuing a response.On Wednesday, Michigan State released the N.C.A.A‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter, which was addressed to Athletic Director Mark Hollis and copied to President Lou Anna Simon. Referring to Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>heinous and appalling assaults,‚<U+0080>ù it cited the principle of athlete wellbeing and a by-law that it said pertained to that principle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s heinous crimes of record against more than 150 victims raise serious concerns about institutional practices, student-athlete safety and the institution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions to protect individuals from his behavior.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement Wednesday, Hollis pledged a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>comprehensive response‚<U+0080>ù to the letter and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation. Of college athletes, he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety.‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A., the governing body of intercollegiate athletics, was widely criticized several years ago for its handling of a case involving Penn State University in which Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant football coach, sexually abused young boys. (Sandusky is serving a decades-long prison term.)Less than a year after the Penn State scandal became public in the fall of 2011, an independent investigation commissioned by Penn State, and led by Louis J. Freeh, helped lead to N.C.A.A. sanctions, including a $60 million fine and the vacating of more than 100 wins from the lifetime record of the former head coach Joe Paterno, who died earlier that year. Several of the penalties were later rescinded, and the wins restored.Critics contended that the N.C.A.A. had overstepped its bounds with those penalties. Emails made public because of a lawsuit two years later appeared to show N.C.A.A. officials questioning whether their institution had the authority to issue such penalties on a university, even one where several high-ranking officials later received jail time for their roles in covering up Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse.In one email, an N.C.A.A. official referred to the consent decree between the association and Penn State as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bluff‚<U+0080>ù and urged a settlement because the N.C.A.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chances of proving a violation of its bylaws before a Committee on Infractions might prove difficult.Last year, an N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions demonstrated just how narrow those bylaws can be when it declined to penalize the University of North Carolina over a scandal in which scores of dubious classes were taken disproportionally by football and men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basketball players. Through gritted teeth, the committee said it could not find an N.C.A.A. violation because the classes had been available to all students.The Nassar case has drawn comparisons to the Sandusky case, raising questions about how university officials responded to warning signs about federal crimes being committed on their campus and about whether they tried to protect someone who was considered valuable to the athletics program. The Michigan State University police received a report about Dr. Nassar as early as May 2014, and on Tuesday a former rower at Michigan State said she had received no response to two separate reports of abuse by Nassar.Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon, a former chair of what is now known as the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors, has faced calls for resignation, though the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s board has largely supported her.The Nassar case has been pushed further into the national spotlight over the past week as Judge Rosemarie Aquilina has allowed more than 140 women, and others connected to the case, to speak at a sentencing hearing for Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to multiple sex crimes and has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. On Monday, three leading members of the board of U.S.A. Gymnastics, which also employed Dr. Nassar for years, resigned amid increasing criticism of how they responded to reports of his abuse.Several voices ordinarily critical of the N.C.A.A. have urged the organization to stay away from the allegations against Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are always mindful of the voices around college athletics,‚<U+0080>ù Remy said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and we strive to do the right thing.‚<U+0080>ùAt the N.C.A.A. Convention last week in Indianapolis, Mark Emmert, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, conspicuously did not mention Michigan State in his annual address, even as he alluded to the U.N.C. scandal and the under-the-table payments in men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s college basketball that federal officials revealed last fall. Emmert told members of the news media at the convention that he did not have enough information on what happened at Michigan State to comment on it in-depth.However, in his address Emmert rebutted the notion that the N.C.A.A. should steer clear of controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dance around those things,‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to various scandals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t make excuses for it. We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say our process is slow.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do we respond? I think, first of all, by not retreating from it, not getting under our desks not hiding from it.‚<U+0080>ùCardinal George Pell, the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s third-highest-ranking official, arrived at a Melbourne court on Monday for the start of several weeks of hearings to determine whether he will face trial on charges of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ùPolice officers lined the sidewalk, as a large contingent of the local and international journalists and members of the public watched the cardinal enter the Melbourne Magistrates‚<U+0080><U+0099> Court.The slow-moving case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> charges were filed in June ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will be a test of both Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s justice system and the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to hold clerics accountable after decades of abuse scandals. Witness testimony began on Monday and is expected to continue for two weeks, during which time the court will be closed to the news media and the public.Here is a guide to what we know, what we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and how the case will be shaped by Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s court system.The son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Melbourne Response,‚<U+0080>ù a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell appeared in court on Monday wearing a black suit and clerical collar and did not speak during the initial session.Read:  How Cardinal Pell Rose to Power, Trailed by a Cloud of ScandalRead:  George Pell, Aide to Pope, Is Put on Defensive in Abuse InquiryCardinal Pell has been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ù No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and ‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses. However, nothing has been made public about the details ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not the number of accusers, not the time frame of the accusations, nor the severity of the acts at the center of the case.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said at a news conference in Rome last June.During Monday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hearing, the prosecution requested amendments to certain charges and requested that emotional support dogs be available to witnesses who testified via video link.Read: Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual AssaultRead: Vatican Sex Abuse Scandal Reveals Blind Spot for Francis Expected to run for four weeks, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committal hearing will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to trial.All relevant evidence will be presented to the magistrate by the prosecution, including witness testimony.Local news outlets have reported that up to 50 witnesses could be called during the hearing process. The court heard last year that some of the witnesses were choir boys at the time of the alleged incidents.All witnesses can be subject to cross-examination by the defense ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a noteworthy detail because Robert Richter, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, has a reputation for a withering and aggressive approach.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to demonstrate that what was alleged was impossible,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Richter told the court last October.Even if the magistrate decides that there is not sufficient evidence to proceed, Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.The hearing‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proceedings are largely conducted outside of public view. Reporters are being granted access for the first day of the hearing but will not be allowed to return to cover actual testimony.Read:  Cardinal George Pell Returns to Australia, Charged With Sexual OffensesAustralian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.The country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s contempt standards prohibit reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after charges have been filed and before a verdict has been reached ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that might be seen as prejudicial against or for a defendant.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information on a wide range of topics including: specific accusations against an individual, prior convictions and affiliations with convicted criminals, and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case.All news media organizations in Australia are subject to this restriction, which has the potential to create vast differences in articles about the case published from inside or outside Australia.Suppression orders are also used in many cases to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even the existence of a suppression order can be banned from publication, meaning that journalists cannot report precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage. These are sometimes referred to as superinjunctions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quite often, orders will be made to protect the fairness of the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial,‚<U+0080>ù said Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, whose research has focused on court proceedings. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the main purpose of an order.‚<U+0080>ùBut, he added, such orders are often approved without rigorous scrutiny about whether they are in fact necessary.In a report published before Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case began, Mr. Bosland wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Open justice is increasingly being undermined in Victoria due to the inappropriate use of suppression orders by the courts.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem in Australia is that the courts tend to make orders that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t comply with the strict requirements of the law.‚<U+0080>ùRead:  Suppression Orders Vs. Open JusticeCORYDON, Ind. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A southern Indiana elementary school teacher faces three dozen counts of child molestation that occurred over a three-year period, authorities said Monday.A not-guilty plea was entered on behalf of Corey Faith, 40, during an initial hearing in Harrison Superior Court. The Corydon man was being held at the Harrison County Jail on a $250,000 cash-only bond.Faith admitted the incidents of molestation occurred from 2005 to 2007 in his home, his classroom at New Middletown Elementary School in Corydon and elsewhere, Harrison County Prosecutor Otto Schalk said.A probable cause affidavit said the alleged victim was 12 years old when the molestations began. She had been a student of Faith's when he taught sixth grade. He most recently taught third grade.Court records said the investigation began March 19 when the Harrison County Sheriff's Department received a tip from a friend of the alleged victim after she spoke of multiple sexual encounters with Faith when she was under 14 years old.The South Harrison Community School Corp. delivered notice Monday of its intent to fire Faith. It issued a statement saying it was ""deeply saddened to learn of the events and critical lapses"" in judgment by Faith that occurred.Online court records didn't list an attorney for Faith.The team doctor accused of molesting scores of young athletes while working with the United States gymnastics team and Michigan State University pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault on Wednesday in Ingham County (Mich.) Circuit Court. He is expected to face at least 25 years in prison.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, 54, was charged with the molestation of seven girls, most of whom were gymnasts, but he has been accused of various levels of inappropriate or abusive sexual behavior by a group of more than 130 women and girls, including the Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas.Sentencing is set for Jan. 12. The victims will have an opportunity to speak.In a brief statement on Wednesday, Dr. Nassar said he made the plea ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to move the community forward and stop the hurting.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I pray every day for forgiveness,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You used your position of trust in the most vile way: to abuse children. I agree that now is a time of healing, but it may take them a lifetime of healing while you spend your life behind bars thinking of what you did by taking away their childhood.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The agreement which was placed on the record today was reached after extensive negotiations with the prosecution and with significant input from Larry Nassar. This agreement resolves all the charged and uncharged conduct for more than 125 cases currently under investigation by the Michigan Attorney General‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office.‚<U+0080>ùDuring the hearing Ms. Raisman sent out a Twitter message describing Dr. Nassar as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>monster.‚<U+0080>ùThe girls involved in this specific plea agreement testified that Dr. Nassar molested them, sometimes with their parents present, while they were seeking treatment for sports-related injuries. Complaints against Dr. Nassar reportedly go back 20 years, but USA gymnastics fired him in 2015, which is when the organization claims to have been made aware of the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He convinced these girls that this was some type of legitimate treatment,‚<U+0080>ù Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis told a judge last summer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why would they question him? Why would they question this gymnastics god?‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman, who was the captain of the teams that took home gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, has been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most vocal public critics, and has fiercely argued that the victims of the case should be blameless, despite some criticism they have received for waiting extended periods of time before reporting the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù she said in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes‚<U+0080>ù this month. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùAfter Ms. Raisman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement, and her subsequent commentary, Ms. Douglas, who had competed alongside her in both Olympics, posted a tweet that quoted a message from Ms. Raisman about the abuse. Ms. Douglas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s post included her own comment, which read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>however it is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd.‚<U+0080>ùThe comment was widely attacked as victim shaming, with Simone Biles, the 2016 all-around gold medalist, showing her disappointment in a post to Twitter in which she said it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shocks me that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m seeing this but it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t surprise me.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Douglas has attempted to walk back the post, saying it was misinterpreted and that victims are always blameless. In her clarifications she revealed that she, too, had been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.Ms. Maroney was the first of the gold medal-winning gymnasts to publicly accuse Dr. Nassar when she revealed details of her abuse in October, and Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist from the 2000 team, was among the initial group of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers last year.While Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal situation appears to be resolved in Ingham County, he faces similar charges in Eaton County, the location of an elite gymnastics club. He is also awaiting sentencing after having pleaded guilty in federal court on child pornography charges.On a flight from Seattle to San Jose, Calif., on Monday, a woman caught a glimpse of some text messages that alarmed her.A man seated in front of her on the Southwest Airlines flight was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>texting about sexually molesting young children,‚<U+0080>ù  the San Jose Police Department said in a news release.The man, identified by police as Michael Kellar, 56, of Tacoma, Wash., was using a large smartphone with enlarged text, making it easier for her to read his messages and take photographs of them.The woman alerted a member of the flight crew, who notified police officers working in the Mineta San Jose International Airport. Mr. Kellar was arrested after the plane landed.The woman is a preschool teacher, said Detective Sgt. Brian Spears, commander of the San Jose Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely a hero in our eyes,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Kellar was charged with attempted child molestation and solicitation of a sex crime, both felonies. He was arraigned on Thursday and was being held without bail at the Santa Clara County Jail.Police named Gail Burnworth, 50, also a resident of Tacoma, as the person Mr. Kellar was suspected of texting. They have also located two children, ages 5 and 7, who may have been victims of sexual abuse.Sergeant Spears said the text messages ‚<U+0080><U+009C>described specific sex acts performed on children, as well as bestiality.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It definitely goes beyond just that flight,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a history of conversations between them.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to a statement from the city of Seattle on Wednesday, it seems that Ms. Burnworth ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had access to the children either as a caregiver or babysitter.‚<U+0080>ù She was arrested in Tacoma on Monday but was released after prosecutors did not formally charge her within 72 hours.She was arrested again on Friday night on a federal warrant for conspiracy to produce child pornography.Southwest Airlines did not provide access to the crew member who alerted police because of the criminal investigation. In an emailed statement, it said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We always encourage customers to say something to our employees or law enforcement if they see something suspicious.‚<U+0080>ùThe authorities in California and Washington said federal charges are likely, and the F.B.I. was involved in the continuing investigation.Capt. Mike Edwards, commander of the Seattle Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said the two children who may have been victims remained at their home with their parents.Police did not identify the teacher who reported the text messages. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re very grateful that she was on that plane,‚<U+0080>ù Captain Edwards said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the big message and the big takeaway on this is, for all of us, is to pay attention to what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going on around you,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You never know how important it could be.‚<U+0080>ùHARRISBURG, Pa. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A judge on Friday sentenced three former Pennsylvania State University officials, including a former president, to short jail terms followed by home confinement for their roles in the child molestation scandal that rocked the university.In March, a jury found Graham B. Spanier, the former president, guilty of one misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a child, and not guilty of two other charges. His lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction, and they argued for a sentence of probation rather than jail time.The officials were charged for failing to go to law enforcement after being told in 2001 that a former assistant football coach, Jerry Sandusky, had been seen molesting a boy in a locker room shower. The officials denied that they were told at the time that the episode in the shower was overtly sexual.Mr. Sandusky went on to assault several other minors, and in 2012, he was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.It is very rare for prosecutors to try to hold university leaders criminally liable for the misconduct of others, and the case is all the more remarkable for involving one of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most prominent universities, and one of its most vaunted football programs.It has been a stunning downfall for Mr. Spanier, 68, who had spoken publicly about his own history of being abused as a child by his father, who beat him severely. He served for 16 years as president of Penn State, until he was forced out in 2011, and had earned a reputation as a skilled, energetic administrator who sometimes went too far in stifling criticism of the university.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The single most important thing I can say is that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080>ù he told the court on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that I did not intervene far more carefully.‚<U+0080>ùIn handing down the sentence in Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, Judge John Boccabella said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a Shakespearean tragedy; this is a fall from grace that is both unfortunate and well deserved.‚<U+0080>ùThe defendants are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good people who made a terrible mistake,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why no one made a phone call to police is beyond me.‚<U+0080>ùLaura Ditka, the deputy state attorney general who was the lead prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Spanier had chosen to protect his and Penn State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputations, rather than protect children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is inexcusable,‚<U+0080>ù she said.The case also badly damaged the reputation of Joe Paterno, the revered head football coach, who was accused of knowing about allegations against Mr. Sandusky. He was fired in 2011, after 45 years, and died a few months later.The university has paid tens of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits filed by Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, and the total could eventually exceed $100 million. Mr. Spanier has also sued the university.Gary Schultz, formerly a senior vice president of the university, and Tim Curley, a former athletic director, were charged along with Mr. Spanier. They pleaded guilty to related charges and testified at the trial of Mr. Spanier, who refused a plea deal.Mr. Spanier‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers had argued that he should not get jail time, in part because of health problems. Prosecutors said he should receive a penalty in the upper part of the allowable range for the conviction, which carries a maximum sentence of one year.Judge Boccabella sentenced Mr. Spanier to four to 12 months‚<U+0080><U+0099> confinement, with at least two months of that in jail followed by home confinement, and a $7,500 fine. He sentenced Mr. Curley to seven to 23 months, with at least three months in jail, and a $5,000 fine; and Mr. Schultz to six to 23 months, with at least two months in jail, and a $5,000 fine. In addition, he imposed two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> probation on all three men.The judge said he was not convinced that Mr. Spanier was as culpable as the other two.Mr. Spanier, who arrived at the courthouse holding hands with his wife, Sandra, remained impassive throughout, and he and his lawyers declined to answer questions as they left. But Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz made emotional appeals for leniency before the sentences were handed down.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sickens me to think that I might have played a part in children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s suffering,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schultz said.A founder of the now-disbanded Minuteman border patrol group has been convicted in Arizona of molesting a 5-year-old girl, bringing to an end a case that gained the attention of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s highest court after he tried to cross-examine the young victim.The defendant, Christopher Simcox, 55, was found guilty Wednesday of molesting the girl, who was a friend of his 6-year-old daughter, between April 21, 2012, and May 23, 2013, during visits to his apartment,  the Maricopa County attorney, Bill Montgomery, said in a statement. Mr. Simcox was in the process of divorcing his wife at the time.The girl told her mother of the abuse, and her mother called law enforcement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The defendant preyed upon a young child while she was meant to be in his care,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This young girl had the courage to come forward to stop the abuse and by doing so revealed his predatory behavior. With this verdict, we have been able to seek justice for this victim.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Simcox was found guilty of two counts of molestation of a child and one count of furnishing obscene materials to a minor, the statement said. He was also accused of sexual conduct with another child, but was found not guilty of that charge, Mr. Montgomery said.Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial took an unexpected turn that could have an impact on future case law. Although he is not a lawyer, Mr. Simcox represented himself and sought to question the girls he was accused of molesting.But prosecutors brought in an expert to address the trauma it would cause the victims, and they took action in lower courts to block Mr. Simcox, eventually filing a petition that is now before the United States Supreme Court.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ultimately, the defendant backed down from his insistence on personally carrying out the cross-examination of his victims and allowed his advisory attorney to question the victims,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though the issue is now moot in this case, it is still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court because of its legal significance.‚<U+0080>ùKerrie Droban, who served as Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advisory counsel, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that she had questioned the girls instead, while Mr. Simcox was allowed during the trial to question two children who were witnesses.Mr. Simcox will be sentenced on July 5. Consecutive mandatory sentences could be tantamount to a life in prison, Ms. Droban said.Mr. Simcox was a former high-profile advocate for tougher control of borders and undocumented day laborers, joining watch groups and speaking out at public events, like one in Farmingville on Long Island in 2003.He was a founder of a volunteer armed watch group, Civil Homeland Defense, which was created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and intercepted undocumented immigrants crossing into Arizona, turning them over to the authorities. Later, he helped form the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, which stepped into the national spotlight in 2005 with high-profile border patrols.The Southern Poverty Law Center said Mr. Simcox, a former kindergarten teacher, was among the movement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most charismatic figures, affecting the likeness of a vigilante with a pistol tucked into the front of his jeans.In 2012, Mr. Simcox told the center, which was investigating the possible involvement of extremist groups in the killings of Mexicans crossing the Arizona border, that he had left the movement and was living a quiet life tutoring schoolchildren in suburban Phoenix.When the verdict in his trial was announced on Wednesday, the mother of the then-5-year-old girl dabbed her eyes with tissue, The Arizona Republic reported.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was convicted on at least one, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s all we need,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This conviction is for all of the children that he hurt.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have words,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s over. I can go home and tell my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùFor more than a year, an F.B.I. inquiry into allegations that Lawrence G. Nassar, a respected sports doctor, had molested three elite teenage gymnasts followed a plodding pace as it moved back and forth among agents in three cities. The accumulating information included instructional videos of the doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unusual treatment methods, showing his ungloved hands working about the private areas of girls lying facedown on tables.But as the inquiry moved with little evident urgency, a cost was being paid. The New York Times has identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he first fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by an Indianapolis Star investigation. Some are among the youngest of the now-convicted predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s many accusers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 265, and counting.The three alleged victims then at the center of the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inquiry were world-class athletes; two were Olympic gold medalists. Nearly a year passed before agents interviewed two of the young women.The silence at times drove the victims and their families to distraction, including Gina Nichols, the mother of the gymnast initially known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Athlete A‚<U+0080>ù: Maggie Nichols, who was not contacted by the F.B.I. for nearly 11 months after the information she provided sparked the federal inquiry.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never got a phone call from the police or the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ù during that time, Gina Nichols, a registered nurse, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not one person. Not one. Not one. Not one.‚<U+0080>ùThe F.B.I. declined to answer detailed questions about the speed and nature of its investigation, or to provide an official who might put the case in context. Instead, it issued a 112-word statement asserting that the sexual exploitation of children ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is an especially heinous crime,‚<U+0080>ù and that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the safety and well-being of our youth is a top priority for the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also said that the many allegations against Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+009C>transcended jurisdictions‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an apparent suggestion that internal efforts to coordinate among its bureaus and with other law enforcement agencies partly explained the inquiry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s slow tempo.The agency left unaddressed the oft-repeated claim by U.S.A. Gymnastics officials that after initially presenting the sexual assault allegations to the F.B.I. in July 2015, they came away with the impression that federal agents had advised them not to discuss the case with anyone. The ensuing silence had dire consequences, as the many girls and young women still seeing Dr. Nassar received no warning.Among them was Emma Ann Miller.By the summer of 2015, Emma Ann, the only child of a single mother, was both a competitive dancer and just another Michigan kid immersed in the joys and dramas of middle school life. She got braces, with baby blue rubber bands that matched her eyes. She began receiving Snapchat attention from boys.And once a month, she went to Suite 420 in a six-story office building close to Michigan State University in East Lansing, where her solicitous doctor, who encouraged everyone to just call him Larry, molested her.According to her lawyer, Emma Ann had about a dozen sessions with Dr. Nassar between the summers of 2015 and 2016. The pain of the procedures increased, and her self-confidence plummeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whenever he asked if my lower back hurt, he would always find a way to touch me down there,‚<U+0080>ù she said, explaining that Dr. Nassar would say that her pelvis was in need of adjustment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whether or not I said my back hurt, he would always find a way to, to. ‚<U+0080>¶‚<U+0080>ùThe young girl paused.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve blocked out a lot of what he did to me,‚<U+0080>ù she said finally.Only three years ago, Dr. Nassar was a popular doctor among the athletes he treated for U.S.A. Gymnastics, known for being goofy but maybe a bit too attentive. His treatments, which gymnastics officials believed were at the cutting edge, were also in demand at Michigan State, where he worked, as well as at Holt High School, and at a gymnastics academy called Twistars.Issues had cropped up: a parent raising concerns about his behavior at Twistars; a female athlete or two at Michigan State complaining to no avail about inappropriate exams. In 2014, a university investigation of another complaint cleared Dr. Nassar of misconduct, but he was now required to have a third person present when treatment involved sensitive areas of the body ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and to wear gloves.Still, the doctor was trusted enough to conduct his procedures ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intravaginal adjustment‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> without supervision when treating the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s best gymnasts at the Karolyi ranch, the exclusive and secluded national team training camp, about 60 miles north of Houston. Gymnasts of international caliber, like Ms. Nichols, of suburban Minneapolis, would spend a week each month at the ranch, under the exacting supervision of the revered coach Martha Karolyi.But at the ranch in late spring of 2015, Ms. Nichols‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal coach, Sarah Jantzi, overheard the 17-year-old girl talking with another elite gymnast, Aly Raisman, about Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s invasive and inappropriate techniques. The alarming information was quickly shared with the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents and, by June 17, with officials at U.S.A. Gymnastics.Gina Nichols, Maggie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, recalled telling Steve Penny, then the president of U.S.A. Gymnastics, that the police had to be called immediately. But he insisted that she not tell anyone, she said. The organization would take care of alerting law enforcement.Weeks of silence passed, Gina Nichols said, interrupted occasionally by admonitions from Mr. Penny to keep quiet about the matter ‚<U+0080><U+0094> although the United States Olympic Committee has said that U.S.A. Gymnastics reported that one of its physicians had been accused of abusing athletes ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and was in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement authorities.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics eventually retained what it called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an experienced female investigator‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a specialist in workplace harassment. After completing her interviews, the investigator recommended on Friday, July 24, that Dr. Nassar be reported to law enforcement.Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman competed the next day at the U.S. Classic in Chicago. Gina Nichols said that she saw Mr. Penny at the event and that he told her: We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re working on this. Keep it quiet.On Monday, July 27, gymnastics officials contacted the F.B.I. in Indianapolis, where U.S.A. Gymnastics has its headquarters. The next day, its chairman, Paul Parilla, and its president, Mr. Penny, met with F.B.I. agents who, they later said, assured them they had come to the right place. Forty-one days had passed since U.S.A. Gymnastics first received the report of the sexual abuse of one of its charges.At this moment, F.B.I. agents in Indianapolis were also immersed in the child-exploitation case of Jared Fogle, the longtime pitchman on Subway television ads. Mr. Fogle was arrested that summer on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child and distribution of child pornography, and later sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison.The gymnastics officials provided the agents with contact information for three gymnasts: Ms. Nichols, Ms. Raisman and someone emerging as the central complainant: McKayla Maroney, then 19, a retired Olympic gold medalist who by the summer of 2015 had become a minor celebrity, struggling in public to find her next purpose in life ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a struggle she has since indicated was related to serious emotional issues stemming from the abuse.They also turned over copies of videos of Dr. Nassar demonstrating his technique as he chatted clinically about pulled hamstrings, buttocks and trigger points. Reporters for The New York Times have seen the videos, which show him kneading the legs of girls before his ungloved hands begin to work under a towel, between the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> legs.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not a fun place to dig,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar says to the camera.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do the hand-shaky thing,‚<U+0080>ù he adds later, demonstrating how he shakes his hand vigorously when it is deep between a girl‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legs.W. Jay Abbott, who at the time was the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. bureau in Indianapolis, said on Thursday that while he did not watch the videos, he vividly remembered the reactions of colleagues who had.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will never forget sitting around the table and thinking, What?‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Abbott, who retired in January. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the reaction of my special agents who were very well versed in this was one of disgust. That is why we worked it with such urgency.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At the time, it was being portrayed as a legitimate medical procedure. But to the layman, like ourselves, we were ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to be kidding me.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe next day, U.S.A. Gymnastics quietly, even surreptitiously, relieved Dr. Nassar of any further assignments. It later issued a statement saying: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>U.S.A. Gymnastics understood from its meeting with the F.B.I. that it should not take any action nor communicate anything that might interfere with the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation.‚<U+0080>ùAll the while, Dr. Nassar continued his uncommon treatment techniques on young patients.Emma Ann Miller remembers the summer of 2015 as her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>best summer ever.‚<U+0080>ùShe competed in a dance competition in Las Vegas, where she performed to a song from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Legally Blonde,‚<U+0080>ù and won a trophy that was two and a half feet tall ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about half her height. She spent time at a sleep-away Bible camp, where she went kayaking, horseback riding and zip-lining, and had water balloon fights.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We T.P.‚<U+0080><U+0099>ed the boys‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabin down the hill and had a Silly String fight with two of the other girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said with a laugh. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone threw a frog into one of the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins. It was so much fun.‚<U+0080>ùBut then there were those monthly visits to the office of Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+0094> doctor to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all of these super-high-up Olympians‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who had treated her mother for years for injuries related to a car accident. Given that Emma Ann had known him her entire life, he was almost like family, an intimacy reflected in the half-dozen photographs of her that he displayed in his treatment room.Dr. Nassar first molested her when she was 10, she recalled. She remembered the pants she was wearing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> black leggings with white flowers, from A√©ropostale. She was having back and neck issues, and he had her remove the leggings and put on loose shorts. In a medical supply room that doubled as a treatment room, he began exploring ‚<U+0080><U+009C>down there.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Is this O.K.?‚<U+0080><U+0099> and I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And he was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Just hang in there.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how it felt. I just knew that it hurt.‚<U+0080>ùIn the summer of 2015, the treatments hurt even more. She had tried wearing three pairs of underpants or especially tight shorts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> anything to keep Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fingers from probing her. Now that she was older, she began lying that she was having her period.At some point, Emma Ann told her mother that she preferred not to be alone with Dr. Nassar. That did not end it. She said he continued to abuse her while positioning himself so that her mother couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t see what he was doing. He would grope the girl beneath a white towel meant to convey propriety, all the while chatting with her mother, a kindergarten teacher.How‚<U+0080><U+0099>s your class going?‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew that he had helped my mom, so I had to persuade myself into thinking that he also helped me,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really sure.‚<U+0080>ùEmma Ann now knows that she was not alone. The growing number of other girls who say they were being molested between the summers of 2015 and 2016 includes Alexis Alvarado, 19, who began seeing Dr. Nassar in 2010 for a stress fracture in her back. He began that treatment by massaging her legs, but then his hands crept up until, she said, his fingers were inside her. She was 12.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize what he was doing was wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Alvarado said. But she explained that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thought everything could be fixed through the butt.‚<U+0080>ù That is why her gymnastics teammates in Lansing, Mich., called him the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>butt doctor.‚<U+0080>ùThe monthly appointments continued through the summer of 2015 and into the next year. So did her shame, and dread.The same was true for Hannah Morrow, of Naperville, Ill., who will turn 18 on Tuesday. Several times a year, starting when she was 11 or 12, she took the four-hour car ride to see Dr. Nassar, looping around the bottom coast of Lake Michigan. At some point, she started listening to playlists she compiled to help keep her mind off what was about to be done to her.She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d try to get hooked on a new song to sing in her head, over and over. Her favorite, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I Write Sins Not Tragedies‚<U+0080>ù by Panic! At the Disco, included the line: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.‚<U+0080>ùAs with Emma Ann Miller, Hannah also began wearing tighter pants and underwear that covered more of her buttocks, in the unrealized hope that it would dissuade him. She struggled to reconcile his outsize reputation with what he was doing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If all of those Olympians loved him, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Hannah remembered thinking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though I feel weird with what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s doing, I guess I shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d make excuses: He doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too close to my butt, or that he brushed over my boobs.‚<U+0080>ùIn late July or early August, F.B.I. agents asked Ms. Maroney to travel to Indianapolis from her home in California to discuss the allegation, according to her lawyer, John Manly, but she declined. It is unclear why an agent did not travel to see her in person. As a result, the first substantive interview of an alleged victim in a child-molestation case was conducted by telephone.Meanwhile, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman continued their gymnastics pursuits ‚<U+0080><U+0094> both competed at the P & G Championships in Indianapolis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but they still had received no word from any law enforcement official about the allegations now lodged with the F.B.I.Some of the delay appears to have been related to questions concerning federal-versus-state jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction within the F.B.I. itself. Although the Indianapolis bureau had received the information, the alleged sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar had taken place in Texas, at the Karolyi ranch, and in Michigan, where he lived and worked. And Ms. Maroney lived in California.According to Mr. Abbott, his agents in Indianapolis did not have the case for long. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we consulted with the U.S. attorney, we knew right away that we would not have venue,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was never really our case.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Abbott said that his agents conducted some interviews, but he declined to say with whom. He also said written reports were sent within weeks to F.B.I. offices in Michigan and Los Angeles.The retired agent emphasized how the sensitivities and difficulties of child-exploitation cases can contribute to the length of investigations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are dealing with victims who sometimes don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be interviewed,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is extremely delicate. And you also have the parents of minors who are sometimes not comfortable with interviews.‚<U+0080>ùAsked why federal law enforcement officials did not notify people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> other gymnasts, parents, coaches ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that a potential child molester was in their midst, Mr. Abbott said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s where things can get tricky.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a duty to warn those who might be harmed in the future,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But everyone is still trying to ascertain whether a crime has been committed. And everybody has rights here‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reference to both the alleged victims and the person being accused.The Nassar case might have been further complicated, he said, by the fact that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there was a vigorous debate going on about whether this was a legitimate medical procedure.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics officials said that around this time they were told that pertinent interviews had been completed and that the case had been transferred to another jurisdiction. Indeed, on Sept. 12, Ms. Maroney was directed by U.S.A. Gymnastics to contact the F.B.I. East Lansing office.According to Mr. Manly, the retired gymnast‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Erin Maroney, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>called repeatedly,‚<U+0080>ù but received no follow-up response.Two weeks later, on Sept. 27, Dr. Nassar announced on Facebook that he was retiring from the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team staff, notwithstanding a note he had posted in late June saying he would remain with the team through the summer of 2016.He did not elaborate.In April 2016, Ms. Raisman shared a gold medal with the national team at the Pacific Rim Championships in Seattle, while Ms. Nichols damaged a knee during training, underwent surgery, and was out for several weeks ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reminder of the physical toll of the sport. Meanwhile, neither she nor her parents heard anything about the federal investigation that U.S.A. Gymnastics had instructed them to remain silent about.The Raisman family was similarly frustrated. According to a person close to the family, Ms. Raisman and her mother, Lynn, repeatedly reached out to Mr. Penny to find out about the status of the federal investigation, only to be told that an F.B.I. agent would be getting in touch with them.Finally, the absence of information about the federal investigation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the increasing concern of the victims and their families ‚<U+0080><U+0094> prompted Mr. Penny and Mr. Parilla, the U.S.A. Gymnastics officials, to visit the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Los Angeles bureau in early May. Mr. Parilla lives in Southern California, as does Ms. Maroney, and Mr. Penny stopped in Los Angeles while returning from an overseas trip.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As time passed, concern about a perceived lack of development prompted Board Chair Paul Parilla and C.E.O. Steve Penny to report the matter a second time to a different F.B.I. office,‚<U+0080>ù U.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement to The Times on Friday.Through a lawyer and a spokeswoman, Mr. Parilla and Mr. Penny declined to be interviewed for this article.The visit appears to have jump-started the federal investigation into Dr. Nassar. Agents asked for more information, including a list of the members of the national women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics team. And on May 17, the F.B.I. finally interviewed Ms. Maroney in person.It had been 294 days since the F.B.I. was first notified of accusations against Dr. Nassar.A few weeks later, on June 13, Gina Nichols received an email from Michael Hess, an F.B.I. agent then based in Los Angeles. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am looking into a complaint that was filed involving alleged misconduct by an individual associated with U.S.A. Gymnastics,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When you have a moment, please give me a call at the below numbers.‚<U+0080>ùIt was a stressful time: Her daughter was preparing for the Olympic trials. But several days later, the gymnast went to a suburban Minneapolis building, not far from her home, to meet Mr. Hess, who had flown in from Los Angeles.In addition, a person close to the Raisman family said that the F.B.I. also contacted Ms. Raisman in the summer of 2016. While Mr. Manly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who represents Ms. Raisman, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Maroney ‚<U+0080><U+0094> applauded the diligence of Mr. Hess, he expressed amazement that so little had been done for so long.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given who these women were, all competing for their country, and given that these assaults had occurred in different states and countries, there was an obvious need to have a multilayered, multijurisdictional investigation,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Manly said.Gina Nichols, who had been instructed by U.S.A. Gymnastics not to talk about the matter, recalled that while venting in a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Hess, the agent told her:You can talk to anybody you want.That August, in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Raisman had an Olympics for the ages, demonstrating poise and leadership as she won three medals, including gold. But Ms. Nichols, returning from her knee injury, was ultimately not invited to join the Olympic team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even as an alternate.Meanwhile, Emma Ann Miller continued to keep her treatment appointments with Dr. Nassar. But the abuse had worsened, and she no longer felt like the bubbly teenager she had been only a year before. She stopped taking selfies because she felt ugly and fat. She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d cry if she received an A-minus on a paper or test, thinking it was evidence of her stupidity.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even want to order a drink at Starbucks because I was so scared I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d mess it up,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said.Her mother, Leslie Miller, struggles now with her rage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at what he did to my happy girl,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Miller said, in tears. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at all the people who could‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve stopped him earlier. My goal is to find every single one of them in the haystack ‚<U+0080><U+0094> expose them all, so this will never happen again.‚<U+0080>ùIt was only a matter of time.On Sept. 12, 2016, The Indianapolis Star published an in-depth investigation detailing allegations that Dr. Nassar had repeatedly molested two gymnasts when they were young. One woman had filed a criminal complaint with the police in Michigan. The other, initially described only as an Olympic medalist, had filed a lawsuit against the doctor and U.S.A. Gymnastics in California. Neither was involved in the F.B.I. inquiry.Suddenly, the Nassar case took on urgency. As other girls and women began calling the Michigan State University Police to file complaints, their numbers eventually growing into the dozens, their abuser did what he could to mask his behavior, including throwing hard drives containing more than 37,000 images and videos of child pornography into the trash for pickup in the morning.But trash pickup in his neighborhood was late that day, allowing a police officer to find the horrifying material while executing a search warrant on behalf of the university police.By the close of 2016, Dr. Nassar was in custody. By the close of 2017, he had been convicted of myriad state charges, as well as federal child pornography charges, based in large part on that state search warrant. Given that he has been sentenced to nearly two centuries in prison, Dr. Nassar will likely die there.In recent weeks, a communal catharsis has played out, as dozens and dozens of empowered victims or their proxies have confronted the doctor at sentencing hearings. The angry but resolute words of Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols have echoed in the courtrooms of Michigan.So, too, have the words of the lesser-known accusers, those girls and young women who report they were abused in the year after allegations were first presented to the F.B.I. in Indianapolis: the likes of Alexis Alvarado and Hannah Morrow ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and Emma Ann Miller, who in November turned 15.The American gymnast McKayla Maroney, an Olympic gold medalist, said she was sexually abused by the same team doctor who is already facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Maroney, 21, posted on Twitter early Wednesday morning that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13.Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven other individuals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 125 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and dozens of civil suits filed against him in Michigan are currently in mediation.In her Twitter post, Maroney said Nassar molested team members, including her, under the guise of treating them for medical conditions over several decades. Her claims matched the stories of other gymnasts and former teammates.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treated,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Maroney said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened in London before my team and I won the gold medal, and it happened before I won my silver.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old. I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treatment.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I thought I was going to die that night.‚<U+0080>ùJamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the gymnasts who have accused Nassar. Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward, and many have joined a lawsuit against USA Gymnastics.Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, declined a request to comment on Wednesday.Maroney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusation comes a day after another gold medalist, Tatiana Gutsu of Ukraine, accused a star gymnast of raping her when she was 15. Gutsu won the all-around title at the 1992 Barcelona Games as part of the Unified Team of former Soviet athletes.Maroney said she chose to speak out publicly because of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Me Too‚<U+0080>ù movement in which women post the phrase on social media to show that they, too, have been sexually assaulted or harassed.Maroney was part of the 2012 American gymnastics team that won a team gold medal. She also won an individual silver on her specialty, the vault.She drew extra attention that year for a look of disappointment she displayed on the medal stand after winning her silver. The picture became an internet meme, often labeled, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>McKayla is not impressed,‚<U+0080>ù and President Barack Obama and others emulated her expression.The American gymnast Aly Raisman said that she too had been sexually abused by the team doctor who is facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Ms. Raisman, 23, made the revelation in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes,‚<U+0080>ù excerpts from which were released Friday, and in a book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fierce,‚<U+0080>ù being released next week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am angry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m really upset because I care a lot, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman was captain of the teams that won gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics. Another member of the 2012 team, McKayla Maroney, said last month that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13. Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the other gymnasts who have accused Dr. Nassar.Dr. Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 100 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges.Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward.Dr. Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, said Friday that he did not have a comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman told ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, USA Gymnastics said it had adopted a new policy that requires the reporting of suspicions of sexual abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused, and we are very sorry that any athlete has been harmed during his or her gymnastics career.‚<U+0080>ùThe interview will air in full on Sunday on CBS.In addition to her team gold medals, Ms. Raisman won the 2012 gold medal in floor exercise, as well as two individual silver medals and one bronze in her Olympics career. She also won four world championships medals and numerous national titles.Though she was the oldest gymnast on both the 2012 and 2016 teams, she has spoken of continuing her career and going for the 2020 Games.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, a former team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics who has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing gymnasts under the guise of medical treatment, was sentenced on Thursday to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.The charges, which stemmed from more than 37,000 images of child pornography found on Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer, are separate from the 10 molestation counts on which sentences will be handed down in January. He pleaded guilty to the pornography charges over the summer, and to the molestation charges in November.Dr. Nassar, 54, is expected to be sentenced to 25 years or more on the molestation charges. But even without that, he is virtually certain to spend the rest of his life in prison after Janet T. Neff, a federal district judge in Grand Rapids, Mich., imposed three consecutive 20-year sentences in the child pornography case.Matthew Newburg, a lawyer for Dr. Nassar, declined to comment on Thursday.The case against Dr. Nassar emerged last year, after an Indianapolis Star investigation found that U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national governing body, had systematically failed to report gymnasts‚<U+0080><U+0099> allegations of sexual abuse by coaches. Then, in September 2016, The Star published detailed accounts from two former gymnasts who said that, among other sexually abusive behavior, Dr. Nassar had penetrated them with his fingers, claiming it was a treatment for back pain.Those two gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Rachael Denhollander, who was the first to step forward by name, and Jamie Dantzscher, who initially remained anonymous but later spoke out publicly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> broke a dam of silence in the sport, more than a year before the #MeToo movement began revealing sexual misconduct by innumerable men in powerful positions. More than 130 women ‚<U+0080><U+0094> mostly but not exclusively gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have now described abuse by Dr. Nassar (who worked both for the national team and for Michigan State University). Among them are at least seven former members of the United States national gymnastics team, including four Olympians.Many of the women submitted victim impact statements to the court before the sentencing on Thursday. Judge Neff ruled last week that they could not be read aloud in the courtroom, but some women shared their statements through other channels.McKayla Maroney, a 2012 Olympian who came forward in October as one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, wrote in her statement that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He abused my trust, abused my body and left scars on my psyche that may never heal,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Maroney wrote, according to ESPN.And Aly Raisman ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the captain of the American women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics teams at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and one of the most outspoken survivors of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> published thousands of words in The Players‚<U+0080><U+0099> Tribune on Thursday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I ask that you give Larry the strongest possible sentence (which his actions deserve), for by doing so, you will send a message to him and to other abusers that they cannot get away with their horrible crimes,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman, 23, said in her statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe knowing that Larry is being held accountable for his abuse will help me and the other survivors feel less alone, like we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re being heard, and open up pathways for healing.‚<U+0080>ùBecause of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, Ms. Raisman wrote, she is frequently afraid: afraid that other doctors will treat her similarly; afraid even that a man will deliver her room service order when she travels.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hold the door open as he drops off the food and keep it open until he leaves,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I often wonder if I am hurting their feelings by being so obviously distrusting of them. I always used to give people the benefit of the doubt, but if a decorated doctor who served on the national team for over 30 years turned out to be a monster, then how can I trust anybody?‚<U+0080>ùEven so, she continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am not a victim. I am a survivor. The abuse does not define me, or anyone else who has been abused.‚<U+0080>ùBeyond Dr. Nassar himself, the cases have ensnared U.S.A. Gymnastics and many of its top officials, whom lawsuits have accused of turning a blind eye and of fostering toxic environments in which abuse could flourish. Earlier this year, U.S.A. Gymnastics adopted stricter reporting policies in response to an extensive report on its previous failings.Some gymnasts said it was difficult to feel entirely victorious after the sentencing, because Dr. Nassar was part of a much larger problem.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, the justice feels very incomplete,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said at a news conference on Thursday.NASHVILLE, Tenn. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A longtime pastor has been returned to Tennessee to face charges that he molested several children during his time leading a Nashville congregation.Media reports say Matthew Dennis Patterson was arrested March 8 by Nashville police in Pennsylvania, where he moved after leaving the Tennessee church last September.Patterson was extradited to Nashville on Friday.He served as pastor of Nolensville Road Baptist Church. After his resignation, authorities say church members went to police with complaints about his requests to ""engage in strange activities"" with children.According to a police statement, children told adult church members that Patterson had asked them to sit on his face and stomach, sometimes in their underwear.Patterson has been indicted on eight counts of aggravated sexual battery. Police say each count is linked to a different child.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a child sex abuse scandal that has rocked English soccer, a former youth coach and talent scout who worked for a number of well-known teams was convicted on Tuesday of 36 counts of sexually assaulting boys aged 8 to 15, from 1979 to 1990.The case against the former coach, Barry Bennell, began in late 2016, when Andrew Woodward became the first professional player to say publicly that he had been molested by a coach, accusing Mr. Bennell. But the scandal widened, as other allegations were made against Mr. Bennell, and then against other well-known coaches and scouts, until those stepping forward to say they had been victimized numbered in the hundreds, including dozens of former professionals.Soccer has taken its place among the institutions tarnished by the disclosure of systematic sexual exploitation, including the Roman Catholic Church, the news media and Hollywood. In Britain, the case of Mr. Bennell came after revelations that Jimmy Savile, a longtime host of BBC television shows who died in 2011, had molested dozens of children.From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Mr. Bennell, now 64, worked for several well-known professional teams ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one, Manchester City, that plays in the upper echelon of the game ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as a scout and sometime coach for youth programs. The work gave him access to boys who lived away from their parents at times.Prosecutors said that he equipped his home with video games, exotic animals and fast food to make it attractive to boys, and that he abused them there and in his car.Twice in the 1990s and again in 2015, Mr. Bennell ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has changed his name to Richard Jones ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was convicted of multiple counts of sexually abusing youth players and sent to prison. The latest revelations were surprising less in that additional long-ago victims might be found than in the numbers and prominence of some of them.The jury in Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday found him not guilty of three charges, and they will continue deliberating on seven others.CHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Federal prosecutors on Friday for the first time provided details of sexual abuse allegations against J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, asserting that he molested at least four boys, as young as 14, when he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades ago.Mr. Hastert, 74, is not charged with abuse because of statutes of limitation, prosecutors said, but he was accused last year of illegally structuring bank withdrawals to pay one of his victims in an effort to hide the abuse. He pleaded guilty in October to the banking violation, and suffered a stroke in November while awaiting sentencing, set for April 27.In a court filing late Friday, making suggestions for a judge who will decide Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentence, the prosecutors described specific, graphic incidents that they say occurred when Mr. Hastert was a popular, championship-winning coach in a small Illinois town in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. The ‚<U+0080><U+009C>known acts,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said, consisted of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intentional touching of minors‚<U+0080><U+0099> groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The actions at the core of this case took place not on the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national public stage but in his private one-on-one encounters in an empty locker room and a motel room with minors that violated the special trust between those young boys and their coach,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors wrote.A lawyer for Mr. Hastert did not reply to a request for comment on the prosecution claims. In a court filing earlier this week, Mr. Hastert, who has stayed largely out of view since the charges emerged nearly a year ago, requested probation and said he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>profoundly sorry‚<U+0080>ù for past conduct, though he did not specify those actions. On Friday, Mr. Hastert also filed under a seal a response to the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-sentence investigation. A hearing is set for next week on whether his filing remains under seal.According to the prosecutors, Mr. Hastert gave one boy, a 14-year-old freshman wrestler, a massage in the locker room, then performed an unspecified sex act on him. Another boy, Stephen Reinboldt, who died in 1995, was sexually abused by Mr. Hastert throughout high school in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his sister and others told the prosecutors. A third boy, who was 17 and remembered Mr. Hastert sitting in a recliner-type chair with a direct view of the locker room shower stalls, said Mr. Hastert had told him that one way to make his wrestling weight was to get a massage, then performed a sexual act. And prosecutors said Mr. Hastert had massaged another boy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s groin area after asking the boy to stay in his hotel room during a wrestling camp.That incident became the center of the prosecution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. It was also the reason that the allegations, which were never exposed during Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s eight years as the Republican speaker of the House, came to light. The boy, known in court documents as Individual A, confronted Mr. Hastert years later, around 2010, asked him why he had done what he did, and sought a settlement ‚<U+0080><U+0094> beginning the payments that would be Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s downfall.In late 2014, as law enforcement authorities were investigating unusually large withdrawals from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bank account, Mr. Hastert said that he was doing nothing unusual with his money ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and that he simply did not trust banks. Not long after, his lawyer told the investigators a different story: The lawyer said that Mr. Hastert was paying large sums ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and promising as much as $3.5 million, the authorities say ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to Individual A because Individual A was extorting him for false allegations of abuse.After a series of recorded phone calls, with Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation, the investigators concluded that there was no extortion, but that Mr. Hastert was actually carrying out an agreed-to settlement for real abuse.Even when Mr. Hastert told Individual A, as investigators listened in, that he needed more time to come up with more money, Individual A ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did not make any threats‚<U+0080>ù and even ‚<U+0080><U+009C>expressed understanding,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. At another point, Individual A seemed agreeable, even empathetic, suggesting that they settle on smaller amounts and keep the payments as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>private, personal matter.‚<U+0080>ù Individual A even pushed Mr. Hastert to tell his wife about the payment agreement, and suggested that an outside lawyer or confidante might be called in.Of the abuse of Individual A, prosecutors said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no ambiguity.‚<U+0080>ùProsecutors said the motel incident had happened during a trip to a wrestling camp, in which several other boys shared a room but where Individual A and Mr. Hastert spent the night together. Individual A told prosecutors he did not know why Mr. Hastert had singled him out.The court filing says Mr. Hastert had the boy strip naked and lay on a bed under the guise of treating a groin pull, but it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became clear to Individual A that defendant was not touching him in a therapeutic manner to address a wrestling injury but was touching him in an inappropriate sexual way.‚<U+0080>ù The boy then ran across the room, confused and embarrassed, before Mr. Hastert asked him to get onto Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s back and to give the coach a massage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Defendant lay on the bed in only his underwear, and Individual A gave him a back massage,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They then went to sleep in the same bed.‚<U+0080>ùWhen Mr. Hastert was charged last year, the accusations rattled the town of Yorkville, Ill., about an hour west of here. Mr. Hastert, a Republican who served as House speaker from 1999 to 2007, was regarded as a hero by many in Yorkville, where he had taught high school. But prosecutors said Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marred by stunning hypocrisy.‚<U+0080>ùThey alluded to a fifth boy from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s days in Yorkville who recalled Coach Hastert brushing against his genitals during a massage at one point. But he said he was unsure whether the contact was intentional though he found it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>very weird.‚<U+0080>ùOf the boys, prosecutors said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He made them feel alone, ashamed, guilty and devoid of dignity. While defendant achieved great success, reaping all the benefits that went with it, these boys struggled, and all are still struggling now with what defendant did to them.‚<U+0080>ùIn the court filing, prosecutors said they believed Mr. Hastert should face up to six months in prison, as suggested under federal guidelines.Prosecutors took note of Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor health, but said that Mr. Hastert could continue getting medical care in prison if needed.Steven A. Block, an assistant United States Attorney, said that Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentencing judge should ‚<U+0080><U+009C>balance the positive nature of defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public service with the need to avoid a public perception that the powerful are treated differently than ordinary citizens when facing sentencing for a serious crime.‚<U+0080>ùBEIJING ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Thirty years after Gao Chengyong embarked on a succession of 11 rape-murders of women in northwest China, a court sentenced him to death on Friday, following an investigation that involved sifting through 230,000 fingerprints.The sentence by a court in Baiyin, a small city in Gansu Province, was not unexpected in China, which executes more prisoners than any other. But the verdict against Mr. Gao, 53, a farmer, itinerant worker and shopkeeper, was widely reported, and applauded, in China, where the killings drew intense attention.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The motives for the defendant Gao Chengyong‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crimes were utterly despicable, the means were utterly vicious, the nature of the crimes utterly vile,‚<U+0080>ù the court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s verdict stated, according to the China News Service, an official agency.The court found that Mr. Gao had killed 11 women, whom he usually followed to their homes. He murdered all but one around Baiyin; another woman was killed in Baotou, a city in the north Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. In many cases, he molested the women and dismembered their bodies. Besides homicide, he also was found guilty of rape and of defiling corpses. He stood trial last July.When Mr. Gao was arrested in 2016, the last murder had taken place 14 years earlier, and the police needed advanced forensic technology, as well as an element of chance, to link him to the crimes.Zhang Enwei, a forensic detective who helped solve the murders, said he had checked 230,000 sets of fingerprints trying to identify a suspect, Beijing News, a newspaper, reported on Friday. But Mr. Gao was one of hundreds of millions of rural migrants who move around, often slipping past city data checks, and he was not caught in the dragnet for fingerprints in Baiyin.But by 2011, the detectives in Baiyin had acquired technology to trace DNA clues, and five years later a relative of Mr. Gao had his DNA sample taken after he was suspected of giving kickbacks. Their shared traits led the investigators to Mr. Gao, who was then running a small store in a school in Baiyin with his wife.Mr. Zhang said Mr. Gao was very calm when he was shown the evidence, according to the Beijing News. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Basically he did not offer too much of a defense,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Mr. Zhang said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew that this day would come.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Gao said he would not appeal the sentence. In an interview last year, his defense lawyer, Zhu Aijun, denied reports that Mr. Gao had chosen as his victims only women and girls with long hair and dressed in red.Mr. Gao said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chosen his targets for crimes at random,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Zhu told a Chinese news website. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That was one of the reasons that it was so hard to crack the case for a long time.‚<U+0080>ùSALT LAKE CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Mormon church is changing its guidelines for how local leaders handle sexual abuse reports and one-on-one meetings with youth a week after a former prominent missionary leader was accused of sexually assaulting two women in the 1980s.The changes announced Monday by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints direct lay leaders never to disregard a report of abuse, a more direct instruction than previous guidelines.A key new rule allows children to bring a parent or adult with them during one-one-one interviews with local church leaders known as bishops. Parents were only allowed in a hallway or adjacent room under old rules. Youth can still go in alone if they choose.Critics say the changes still don't go far enough.The guidelines also tell leaders to never encourage a person to stay in a home or situation where abuse is suspected, guidance not in there before. An introduction to the guidelines says most, but not all, ""allegations of abuse made by assault victims are true, and should be taken seriously and handled with great care.""The meetings with children usually happen twice a year starting at age 12. Bishops ask about topics such as school, sports, hobbies, education goals and family issues. The questions sometimes delve into sexual behavior because of the church's strict teachings on abstinence before marriage.Last year, a group of Mormons and ex-Mormons demanded an end to the one-on-one interviews and a prohibition on all sexual questions.Sam Young, a Mormon father from Houston who is leading the campaign, said Tuesday the changes don't go far enough. He said a parent or adult should be required for all meetings. He said sexual questions often become explicit and argues children should only be asked if they are obeying the faith's law of chastity.The group plans a protest march Friday in Salt Lake City and expects to deliver 50,000 signatures to church headquarters.""Our march is even more important than it's ever been because we know the church is listening,"" said Young, 65, a former bishop and missionary. ""I care about the church. This is my church. What are we're doing harming these children gives my church a horrid name.""Mormon church spokesman Eric Hawkins on Tuesday pointed to previous comments that the interviews allow bishops to get to know youth better and determine their religious habits and obedience to God. The bishops are instructed how to handle the meetings and swear to keep the conversations confidential, he said.""They are counseled to not be unnecessarily probing or invasive in their questions, but should allow a young person to share their experiences, struggles and feelings,"" Hawkins said.Former Mormon Amy Hall, 56, compared the changes to ""putting a Band-Aid on open surgery.""She said she was molested around the age of 12 by a bishop in Bakersfield, California, causing her a lifetime of shame and leading her to leave the faith in her 20s. The Associated Press doesn't normally name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Hall agreed to share her story to support Young's campaign and said she hopes other Mormon children don't have to endure similar abuse.She never reported her abuse and only recently confronted how it impacted her life, adding she is in therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Asking children about sexual things is perverted,"" Hall said.A letter sent by new Mormon president Russell M. Nelson to local and regional leaders in the U.S. and Canada announced the changes. ""This global issue continues to be of great concern to us today,"" Nelson wrote.The changes come as the church investigates two allegations of sexual abuse against a former missionary leader in the 1980s. Joseph L. Bishop has denied the allegations through his adult son but he acknowledged in a police interview that he asked one of the women to expose her breasts at a time when he was president of the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.Bishop is also heard apologizing on a secretly recorded conversation made by one of the victims. He is heard saying he molested the second woman during a massage that he said got ""too frisky.""The church said it knew previously about both claims, but declined to discipline Bishop because the allegations couldn't be verified.This past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Denver ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The radio host whom Taylor Swift has accused of groping her testified Tuesday that her version of what occurred is false and that her account, embraced and acted upon by his employers, ruined his life.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cost me my career, the thing I love to do, my passion,‚<U+0080>ù the host, David Mueller, who was known on air as Jackson, said. He was the first witness to testify in the trial that grew from the civil case he filed in 2015 against Ms. Swift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been hard on my friends,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has an impact on my girlfriend. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable.‚<U+0080>ùIn court documents, Ms. Swift says Mr. Mueller put his hand up her dress and grabbed her bottom as he posed for a photograph with her before a June 2, 2013, concert in Denver. Mr. Mueller contends Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account led the Denver radio station KYGO to fire him and he later sued the entertainer, her mother and one of her managers. Ms. Swift then countersued, accusing Mr. Mueller of assault and battery.Eight jurors ‚<U+0080><U+0094> six women and two men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will decide the two suits and they listened Tuesday in United States District Court here as both sides outlined their cases.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, hammered at Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility during cross-examination, raising, for example, the disappearance of recordings that Mr. Mueller had secretly made of conversations with his bosses about Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations. And while Mr. Mueller said he had filed suit to clear his name, not to win a specific amount in damages, he acknowledged to Mr. Baldridge that he had hired an expert who determined the termination had cost him nearly $3 million.Mr. Mueller also acknowledged a strained relationship with his superiors at KYGO before the encounter with Ms. Swift and he noted that his suit targets only Ms. Swift and her associates, not the station or its executives.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He wants you to give him the payday,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Baldridge told the jurors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is trying to make the victim pay the price.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift, who also is scheduled to testify, sat with her lawyers and looked at Mr. Mueller occasionally during his testimony. At times she appeared to be taking notes which she shared with her mother. It is unclear when Ms. Swift will take the stand.Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice was shaky at the start of his testimony under questioning by his lawyer but grew steadier. Pressed hard for answers during the cross-examination, his voice occasionally rose in pitch and several times he looked toward the judge, as if for support, when questions came in a barrage.His lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, said in his opening statement that his client, who was with his girlfriend during the photo shoot, had no reason to jeopardize a lucrative job and a budding relationship by groping Ms. Swift.Mr. Mueller repeatedly denied groping Ms. Swift. He said that he reached out with his right arm and a closed hand and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>felt what seemed to be a rib cage‚<U+0080>ù with his knuckles as he rushed to get into position for the photograph. In that image, which was shown to jurors Tuesday, Ms. Swift is standing at a slight distance from Mr. Mueller, whose right arm is extended behind her back and toward her bottom. His hand is not visible and is it not possible to see whether the back of her skirt has been moved.Under questioning from Mr. Baldridge, Mr. Mueller said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible‚<U+0080>ù his hand came into contact with Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bottom, and if so she had a right to tell KYGO officials.Mr. Mueller also testified about a conversation he said he had with his boss, Hershel Coomer, known professionally as Eddie Haskell. He said Mr. Coomer, a longtime acquaintance of Ms. Swift, told him that he had greeted her at the Pepsi Center by putting his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hand on her butt.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mueller described Mr. Coomer going on to speculate that the singer wore bicycle shorts under her stage outfits. Mr. Mueller said he did not give that account to imply Mr. Coomer had groped Ms. Swift.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer said Mr. Coomer would testify that he never said the things Mr. Mueller has attributed to him.Mr. Baldridge described Ms. Swift as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taking a stand through this case for all women, including my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fans rose early for a chance to see her in court and filled a quarter of the courtroom. The presiding judge, William J. Mart√≠nez, set aside 32 seats for the public in the courtroom and 75 in an overflow room with a closed circuit video feed of the proceedings.Lucy Peterson, 17, arrived at the downtown Denver courthouse just after 4 a.m. Tuesday with two friends from her Denver high school to seize the first places in a line that had grown to two dozen by 8 a.m. Ms. Peterson said she believed many of Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s admirers had experienced sexual harassment and looked up to the star for speaking out about something that others might be embarrassed or afraid to address.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shedding light on the issue and I hope bringing more attention to it,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Peterson said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her experiences,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not different from ours.‚<U+0080>ùNEW YORK ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Summer Zervos, a California restaurant owner who appeared as a contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" isn't asking for much in her defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump. She wants less than $3,000 and an apology for what she said were unwanted sexual advances.But if the lawsuit continues, it could land Trump in the same cycle of depositions and document discovery that caused so much trouble for President Bill Clinton after he was sued by Paula Jones.That would mean he would have to answer potentially embarrassing questions under oath about his relationships with women.Trump's attempts to get the lawsuit tossed out have failed so far, but the battle isn't over yet.Here's a look at the case and where it could go from here:WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT?Near the end of the presidential race, Zervos and more than a dozen other women came forward to say Trump had sexually harassed or assaulted them.Zervos, who appeared on ""The Apprentice"" in 2006, said that when she returned months later to inquire about a job, Trump groped and forcibly kissed her.Trump said Zervos and his other accusers made up phony stories to get attention.""Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election,"" Trump tweeted.Zervos isn't suing Trump for sexual harassment. The statute of limitations for that kind of lawsuit passed years ago. She's suing Trump for calling her a liar, saying it harmed her reputation.In the suit, Zervos has asked for an apology, a retraction of Trump's denials, and at least $2,914 in compensation, though damages could ultimately be higher if a jury finds the president defamed her.WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE TO PROVE TO WIN?Zervos has to prove Trump lied about her to other people and that those lies caused real harm. Legal experts say that means she must show that Trump really did kiss and grope her against her will.Proving that took place won't be easy since the encounter allegedly took place in 2007 in Trump's room at the Beverly Hills Hotel. But in trying to build a case, Zervos' lawyers can request documents, videos, and emails in which Trump, his employees or aides might have discussed the incident.They can also request that the president be questioned under oath, in which case he would be obligated to answer questions truthfully.""The nature of that relationship, his behavior and his conduct ... that's all on the table,"" said Alexander A. Reinert, a law professor and director of the Center for Rights and Justice at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.CAN TRUMP GET THE CASE THROWN OUT?He's trying. A New York judge on March 21 shot down an initial attempt to get the case dismissed.Trump's attorneys have said they will appeal. They say the case should at least be delayed until Trump is out of office.They may face an uphill fight. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1997, in the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Jones against then-President Bill Clinton, that presidents are not immune from civil litigation while in office.That ruling forced Clinton to answer questions under oath for nearly six hours in 1998.But Trump's lawyers might have luck delaying the case through appeals and legal maneuvers. Jones' lawsuit against Clinton was tied up in court for four years before he was finally forced to testify ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after he had been re-elected.WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A DEPOSITION?For Clinton, the Jones deposition was a disaster. Faced with embarrassing questions about adultery, he denied having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.That denial was investigated by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who questioned Clinton before a federal grand jury. Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice by the U.S. House of Representatives, but was ultimately acquitted by the U.S. Senate.Zervos' attorney, Mariann Wang, now says she wants to get Trump to give a deposition, where she would get a chance to ask the same sorts of uncomfortable questions.A lawyer for Stormy Daniels also wants to depose Trump in a legal dispute involving a $130,000 payment paid to the porn actress in exchange for her silence about a consensual extramarital affair.""The president has the ability to avoid a crisis by, one, not being deposed, or, two, telling the truth,"" said attorney Joseph Cammarata, who represented Jones in her lawsuit. ""It poses a peril if you don't tell truth. Even if you're the one running the country.""Even if Trump is truthful, there could still be political fallout.""I think people are revisiting their thoughts on the subject of what's right and what's wrong with respect to claims of sexual assault,"" Cammarata said.Wang said in court that she could work around Trump's busy schedule and would agree to videotaped depositions.""We can take a deposition down to Mar-a-Lago in between him going to play golf,"" she said, a jab at Trump's frequent visits to his Florida resort.SYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats.But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter.Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crony politics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,‚<U+0080>ù said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland.The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is not a healthy place,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Joyce, a gregarious bull of a man often seen in a trademark Akubra bush hat, now faces a series of uncomfortable questions:‚<U+0080>¢ Were public funds used to cultivate an extramarital affair?‚<U+0080>¢ How did he and his new partner, Vikki Campion, a former journalist, end up in a supporter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s free apartment?‚<U+0080>¢ How did Ms. Campion  secure a high-paying job with a Parliament colleague?‚<U+0080>¢ And, did Mr. Joyce grope a woman after an awards ceremony in 2011?Mr. Joyce, 50, has denied groping and other ministerial misconduct. He has spent much of the week offering defiance and remorse, and trying to hold on to his job.He acknowledged his relationship with Ms. Campion on Tuesday, apologizing to his family, his constituents and the National Party of Australia, which he still leads.But he also told his party colleagues he would not step down. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Every political career has a time of trial,‚<U+0080>ù he said.His stand fits with his longstanding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>just a bloke‚<U+0080>ù appeal. He grew up on a farm in Tamworth, in Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s southeast, which is home of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s largest country music festival. Mr. Joyce is known as an off-the-cuff maverick who is loyal less to ideology than to his constituents.But since 2004, he has been a Canberra man. He was a senator for Queensland and then joined the House of Representatives in 2013. He became leader of the National Party and deputy prime minister in 2016.Mr. Joyce is no stranger to scandal. A few years ago he made headlines worldwide when he threatened to euthanize two dogs belonging to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after the celebrity couple brought them to Australia without the proper documentation and quarantine.Last year, Mr. Joyce was one of several politicians revealed as holding dual citizenship.After the High Court ruled that he had been ineligible to run for Parliament because of it, Mr. Joyce renounced his New Zealand citizenship and returned to his district to campaign again for his seat. He won comfortably.But experts say the backlash has only been intensified by his supposed authenticity, his eagerness to parade his wife and four children in political campaigns, and his brash conservative positions, like his opposition to same-sex marriage, which he argued would destroy families.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The public expected a Barnaby that was a solid country family man, and we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re seeing that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not that at all,‚<U+0080>ù said Jill Sheppard, a lecturer in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there was a political trait Australians hate, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hypocrisy,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said.But the biggest threat to Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s career may involve questions about the mingling of adultery, money and power.Records show he claimed a travel allowance for 50 nights in Canberra last year when Parliament was not in session, far more than other senior leaders.Government watchdogs and journalists have also zeroed in on two high-paying positions that were allegedly created for Ms. Campion in the offices of a party colleague, Senator Matt Canavan.Mr. Joyce and Prime Minister Turnbull ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has continued to back him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> said the jobs were beyond reproach because Ms. Campion was not technically his partner at the time.Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s critics contest that assertion.Officially, for now, Mr. Joyce still has the support of his party. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Barnaby Joyce is the best deliverer for rural and regional Australians in generations,‚<U+0080>ù  Bridget McKenzie, the Nationals deputy, told reporters on Wednesday.But time is not on his side. Mr. Turnbull is scheduled for an overseas trip that includes meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23, which would make Mr. Joyce the acting prime minister.A broader reckoning on the capital‚<U+0080><U+0099>s workplace culture may also be coming.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the Australian public feels the political class is isolated and don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t appreciate their concerns, then that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem the political class has to respond to,‚<U+0080>ù said Andrew Giles, a Labor Party politician.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not meeting people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expectations,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re legitimate expectations.‚<U+0080>ùIf ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù suffered any loss of visibility during its monthlong Winter Olympics hiatus, the show got a most unusual promotional boost on Friday. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when President Trump, a frequent target of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù and a once-vocal critic of the show, broke a monthslong silence and went on Twitter to vent his spleen at Alec Baldwin, his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù impersonator.A complete rundown of the Trump-Baldwin spat can be found here, but to quickly summarize, Baldwin in an interview on Thursday said that every time he plays the president now, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like agony,‚<U+0080>ù adding that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we have to get rid of him.‚<U+0080>ù In response, Trump tweeted that Baldwin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me‚<U+0080>ù and that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>agony for those who were forced to watch.‚<U+0080>ù Baldwin then followed with a series of tweets in which he mused, among other things, that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to stick around in the role long enough ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride‚<U+0080>ù to Mar-a-Lago.This weekend‚<U+0080><U+0099>s broadcast of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.,‚<U+0080>ù hosted by Charles Barkley and featuring the musical guest Migos, didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t directly acknowledge the feud, though it did give Baldwin plenty of airtime to lampoon the president in its opening sketch.In what purported to be another presidential listening session on gun control, Baldwin (as Trump) led off by addressing the audience: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tonight I am here to bring you a message of healing and a show of unity,‚<U+0080>ù he said as he looked at his notes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hear you and I care. Rent ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Lego Ninjago Movie.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Sorry, Eric scribbled some notes on there, too.‚<U+0080>ùAfter contemplating the idea of taking guns away from all Americans ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even whites‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+0094> Baldwin went on to address the latest personnel losses in the Trump administration. Paying homage to Hope Hicks, the outgoing White House communications director, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like a daughter to me. So smart, so hot. You know, I hate seeing her go but I love watching her walk away.‚<U+0080>ùIn her absence, Baldwin said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jared Kushner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basically the hottest chick left in the place.‚<U+0080>ù And when he sought assurance from Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that he was still on board, the camera cut to an empty chair with McMaster‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name in front of it.Turning to the subject of tariffs, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Both sides hated it. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I said I was going to run this country like a business. That business is a Waffle House at 2 a.m. Crazies everywhere, staff walking out in the middle of their shift, managers taking money out of the cash register to pay off the Russian mob.‚<U+0080>ùIn other highlights from the episode:Though he occasionally stumbled in his delivery, Barkley, the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Inside the NBA‚<U+0080>ù analyst, scored with a pointed comedic commentary on the role of athletes in American civic life. He began:Alluding to the Fox News host Laura Ingraham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recent criticism of LeBron James, Barkley added:At the conclusion of his monologue, Barkley traded riffs with the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Michael Che. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud to stand for the anthem,‚<U+0080>ù Barkley said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unless Fergie is singing it, and I just fall over laughing.‚<U+0080>ùChe responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I stay seated for the anthem, because I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m still in my Uber. Because black people are always late.‚<U+0080>ùOn the night before the Oscars, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù imagined a far more scathing (if timely) event called the Grabbies, presented by the Academy of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Hollywood and dedicated, as an announcer described, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>celebrating this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worst behavior in entertainment.‚<U+0080>ù Its categories include Handsiest Actor, Best Animated Grope, Worst Thing Done to a Plant and the coveted Cecil B. Molestin‚<U+0080><U+0099> Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as Most Open Robe. Previewing his possible awards speech, an actor played by Pete Davidson said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, first, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to thank guns for pivoting the national conversation away from harassment. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d also like to thank my uncle for always saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Boys will be boys.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Even when it was, like, O.J.‚<U+0080>ùPlaying the soon-to-be departed Hope Hicks, Cecily Strong recalled her time at the Trump White House as if it were summer camp. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You make all these new friends,‚<U+0080>ù she explained. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You barely get any sleep and then everybody leaves after eight weeks.‚<U+0080>ù She bid farewell to friends like Kellyanne Conway (‚<U+0080><U+009C>You taught me that a strong woman can run a campaign and win. And you showed me what I could turn into if I stick around too long‚<U+0080>ù), and in a final message to her colleagues, she said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll see you guys at the reunion in 10 years. Seven with good behavior.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù cast member Leslie Jones, who provided running commentary on the Winter Olympics both in person and over Twitter, spoke to the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Colin Jost about her time in Pyeongchang. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a six-foot black woman,‚<U+0080>ù Jones told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You think I stand out in America? Everybody in Korea was 4-foot-1. They either thought I was an athlete or a guy. Some of them thought I was a Transformer, but Transformers don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t eat Korean barbecue like that.‚<U+0080>ùAt the end of her segment, Jones brought out Hilary Knight, a member of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> gold-medal winning women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hockey team, and gave Jost a warning. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be talking about how you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to teach me something,‚<U+0080>ù Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got friends who are gold-medal Olympians.‚<U+0080>ùTo understand what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s at stake in the battle between Apple and the F.B.I. over cracking open a terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphone, it helps to be able to predict the future of the tech industry.For that, here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one bet you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never lose money on: Digital technology always grows hungrier for more personal information, and we users nearly always accede to its demands. Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphones hold a lot of personal data ‚<U+0080><U+0094> your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow‚<U+0080><U+0099>s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.Consider all the technologies we think we want ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.This gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.But if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no longer any room for keeping secrets?‚<U+0080><U+009C>This case can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be a one-time deal,‚<U+0080>ù said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is about the future.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards is the author of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intellectual Privacy,‚<U+0080>ù a book that examines the dangers of a society in which technology and law conspire to eliminate the possibility of thinking without fear of surveillance. He argues that intellectual creativity depends on a baseline measure of privacy, and that privacy is being eroded by cameras, microphones and sensors we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re all voluntarily surrounding ourselves with.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>deviant‚<U+0080><U+0099> ideas ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The particular legal issue is actually quite narrow,‚<U+0080>ù James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., wrote in a blog post on Sunday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s it.‚<U+0080>ùBut civil liberties activists say they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d have an easier time believing Mr. Comey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s assurances if there weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a long history of the government relying on legal cases based on old technology to decide how to handle newer technologies. Courts in the 1960s and 1970s created rules for the wiretapping of analog phone calls; those rulings were later applied as the basis for mass surveillance of the Internet.‚<U+0080><U+009C>By and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before email, before search engines, before social networks,‚<U+0080>ù said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Soghoian pointed out the government had already tried to turn connected devices into surveillance machines. In a mob case more than a decade ago, the F.B.I. asked a company that made an in-dash roadside assistance device ‚<U+0080><U+0094> something like OnStar, which uses a cellular phone to connect to an operator in case of an emergency ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to secretly record the private conversations of people inside a car. A court ruled against the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s request, but only on the very narrow grounds that bugging the car would have interfered with the proper functioning of the in-dash device.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Soghoian said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Soghoian was referring to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s handy digital assistant, a device that is constantly listening to your household conversations to try to offer you friendly help. The Echo listens for a keyword ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alexa!‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prompts it to start streaming your voice to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s servers to decipher your request. Amazon, which declined to comment on how the Apple case might affect Echo users‚<U+0080><U+0099> privacy, has said it is not constantly recording people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voices, and that it keeps voice recordings only to help the system learn to better understand you.But the Apple case threatens to undermine those promises. If a court can get Apple to hack into an iPhone, why couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t it also force Amazon to change the Echo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s security model so the Echo can record everything you say? Mr. Soghoian believes the Apple case could set that precedent.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Some readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t buy the Amazon Echo. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t put cameras in your house. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re home and when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not.There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.The Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From a historical perspective, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re entering into a very new era,‚<U+0080>ù said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.‚<U+0080>ùBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Now we have a surveillance-enabled world,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Granick said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cheap, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy. The question that society has to ask is, Is that what we really want?‚<U+0080>ùAn Alaska Airlines pilot has sued the airline, alleging she was drugged and raped by another pilot during a layover last year.The lawsuit by Betty Pina, 39, was filed in King County Superior Court in Washington State on Wednesday, 20 days after it was presented to the airline on Feb. 13. A copy of the complaint was provided by her lawyer, Eric John Makus.It claims that Ms. Pina, an Army veteran who flew helicopter missions in Afghanistan, was the co-pilot on a June flight with the captain from Anchorage to Seattle to Minneapolis, where the two had a scheduled layover.According to the complaint, the pilot asked Ms. Pina to join him for pizza and drinks in the hotel bar where flight crews spend time. Once there, Ms. Pina said she had one glass of wine, and then he brought her a second. Sitting on a stool, she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hard time keeping her head up‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>things appeared to be closing in,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint says.It claims that he proceeded to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>drug Ms. Pina and rape her during a state of involuntary intoxication.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawsuit was reported this week by The Seattle Times and other local news outlets.In an interview late on Thursday, Ms. Pina, reached between flights, repeated many of the details in the lawsuit. It says she blacked out, and when she came to early the next morning, she was in his hotel room bed, naked from the waist down; her underwear was in her purse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew something gravely bad had happened,‚<U+0080>ù she said in the interview.In the lawsuit, she said she was sick and vomited, and when she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>challenged‚<U+0080>ù the pilot, he denied that there had been sexual contact and replied, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You were coming on to me pretty hard.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the lawsuit, a flight attendant told a flight operations officer that she saw the pilot walking down the hall ‚<U+0080><U+009C>with a girl and two glasses of wine,‚<U+0080>ù and that the attendant expressed concern about flying with him.The two were taken off duty for the return to Seattle on June 6, the day after the episode. Ms. Pina said over subsequent weeks, she reported details of what she could remember to the union, an airline human resource official and an investigator referred by the airline. She did not report the episode to the police.She did not fly again until January, she said.Ms. Pina is seeking damages for workplace rape and the airline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unlawfully retaliatory‚<U+0080>ù actions, according to the complaint. It claims that the airline has failed to hold the male pilot accountable and that he poses a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>threat to other employees.‚<U+0080>ùCourts in the United States have previously tackled the issue of sexual harassment of flight crews during layovers, expanding the definition of a work site. In 2001, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Delta Air Lines was potentially liable for not doing enough to stop what a flight attendant said was a rape by another attendant, even though the events occurred when the two were off duty in a hotel room.In a statement, Alaska Airlines said it was taking the matter seriously.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our policy is to withhold an employee from work during this type of investigation,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was immediately removed from flying back in June and remains on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.‚<U+0080>ùThe pilot, who is not named as a defendant, could not be reached on Friday. He has not been charged with a crime.Ms. Pina has been flying for 17 years, including seven years of active duty military service that included flying Chinook helicopters in Afghanistan, for which she was featured in a PBS documentary series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kansas to Kandahar: Citizen Soldiers at War.‚<U+0080>ùShe started working for Alaska Airlines in 2016. She said that after years in the military, she was accustomed to reporting problems only to her superiors. That, she said, might explain why she did not report what happened to the police when she returned to the Seattle area.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought to call the police,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was more worried about my job than my own personal safety.‚<U+0080>ùBut over time, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew I failed myself.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Pina said that she pursued the lawsuit because she wanted the company to hold the pilot accountable. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened on an overnight with a captain who was abusing his position of authority in an opportunity with me being in a hotel right next to him,‚<U+0080>ù she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It needs to stop from being swept under the rug,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t hate my company. I just hope they step up, and say we have zero tolerance and maybe make any future attackers think twice and not follow through.‚<U+0080>ùIn 1995, Drew Dixon was working her dream job as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, helping to oversee a chart-topping album and a ubiquitous single by Method Man and Mary J. Blige. But as her star rose, Ms. Dixon, then 24, was spiraling into depression, she said, because of prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, Russell Simmons, the rap mogul and co-founder of the label.On work calls, he would talk graphically about how she aroused him. At a staff meeting, he asked her to sit on his lap. He regularly exposed his erect penis to her. Late that year, Mr. Simmons raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment, Ms. Dixon said. She quit Def Jam soon after.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was broken,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In recent interviews, four women spoke on the record about a pattern of violent sexual behavior by Mr. Simmons, disclosing incidents from 1988 to 2014. Three of the women say that he raped them.In each case, numerous friends and associates said they were told of the incidents at the time. The women said they were inspired to come forward in the aftermath of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, as victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> stories have been newly elevated and more often believed.Told in detail about the rape accusations and other misconduct, Mr. Simmons, 60, said in a statement: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have enormous respect for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power.‚<U+0080>ù[Read Russell Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Complete Statement]Last month, Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a forefather of hip-hop who went on to great success in fashion, media and more ‚<U+0080><U+0094> apologized for being ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thoughtless and insensitive‚<U+0080>ù and announced he was stepping down from his companies after the screenwriter Jenny Lumet became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual assault at the time.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have re-dedicated myself to spiritual learning, healing and working on behalf of the communities to which I have devoted my life,‚<U+0080>ù he said in his statement on Wednesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have accepted that I can and should get dirt on my sleeves if it means witnessing the birth of a new consciousness about women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What I will not accept is responsibility for what I have not done. I have conducted my life with a message of peace and love. Although I have been candid about how I have lived in books and interviews detailing my flaws, I will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.‚<U+0080>ùThe most powerful men and companies in popular music have thus far gone largely unscathed in the national reckoning over sexual abuse. A major reason: Sex and debauchery are built into the music industry, where the boundaries between work and play blur in late nights at clubs and studios, and many women have scant power or incentive to complain about being mistreated.These women still face powerful industry gatekeepers like Mr. Simmons, whose pedigree and ability to make or break careers allowed his abusive behavior to go unchallenged for decades, his accusers contend. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Russell was like the king of hip-hop,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.She said she was later harassed by another boss, L.A. Reid, the music legend known for his work with TLC and Mariah Carey, driving her from a business where women had little autonomy. In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Reid did not address the specific claims but apologized if his words were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misinterpreted.‚<U+0080>ùBlack women, especially, felt powerless against Mr. Simmons and his cohort in the small world of urban music, with several saying that misconduct against them could go unchecked because their place in the industry was so tenuous. They feared being ostracized, or worse.Three of the women now accusing Mr. Simmons were pursuing careers in the music industry that they said were disrupted or derailed in part by their experiences with him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sing for almost a year,‚<U+0080>ù said Tina Baker, a performer who said Mr. Simmons raped her in the early ‚<U+0080><U+0099>90s, when he was her manager. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The second he agreed to work with me, my budget increased, the label was paying more attention to me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker recalled. But after the assault, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into oblivion.‚<U+0080>ùFirst known as a hyperactive party promoter turned manager from Queens who helped boost Run-DMC, Mr. Simmons was among the first to view hip-hop as a big business and cultural force. In 1983, with the producer Rick Rubin, he made Def Jam the defining rap label of its era, with hits by the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Public Enemy.Even after Mr. Simmons sold his remaining stake in Def Jam for a reported $100 million in 1999, he served as an ambassador for hip-hop through comedy (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Def Comedy Jam‚<U+0080>ù), clothing (Phat Farm) and activism. Today, his company Rush Communications oversees an array of businesses and nonprofits.In 1987, Toni Sallie, a music journalist for the trade magazine Black Radio Exclusive, met Mr. Simmons while on assignment. She found him to be a charming, if gruff, playboy. They ended up going on a few dates before Ms. Sallie, then 28, decided they were not a match.But the two remained cordial, Ms. Sallie said, and in the fall of 1988, Mr. Simmons invited her to his Manhattan apartment for a party he said he was hosting for his girlfriend. When Ms. Sallie arrived, the place was empty except for Mr. Simmons, she recalled. Saying he wanted to show her the apartment, Mr. Simmons led her to his bedroom.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He pushed me on the bed and jumped on top of me, and physically attacked me,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We were fighting. I said no.‚<U+0080>ù He raped her, she said. Two friends, Sheila Brody and Arlene Hirschkowitz, and a colleague confirmed that Ms. Sallie told them about the assault around the time it happened.Through his lawyer, Brad D. Rose, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he dated Ms. Sallie but denied any nonconsensual sex.Ms. Sallie said she was too afraid to report the assault: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I went to the police, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how that would turn out.‚<U+0080>ùShe also worried about her burgeoning career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to understand, I was very much in a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s game,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Sallie said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Black women were just starting to break into the field.‚<U+0080>ùAbout a year later, at a music conference in South Florida, Ms. Sallie, who was then working for Warner Bros. Records, said she encountered Mr. Simmons in a hotel lobby. When he tried to lead her to a dark beach, she resisted and he attacked her, grabbing her by the hair, she said, and even chasing her into the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s restroom before she escaped to her room, where she barricaded the door. (‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did Mr. Simmons conduct himself inappropriately,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rose said.)To this day, Ms. Sallie said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t feel comfortable in a room full of men.‚<U+0080>ùMusic executives she told about the hotel incident brushed it off, she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt alone for 29 years,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like nobody would listen to me.‚<U+0080>ùFollowing the reports of alleged misconduct by Mr. Simmons in November, Ms. Sallie said she contacted the Manhattan district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to accuse him.A law enforcement official confirmed that a woman contacted the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to report an incident from 1988 and added that a different anonymous woman had recently reported an incident from 1991. The official said the incidents had occurred so long ago that the statute of limitations had lapsed and the crimes had not been prosecuted. There are no details about the woman from the 1991 incident.But the official said the women had been referred to the New York Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Special Victims squad so that there would be a record of their complaints if more recent allegations were to emerge.Ms. Baker, the singer, thought Mr. Simmons could elevate her career as her new manager. She had performed as a backup vocalist for Madonna and Bruce Springsteen, and, as Tina B, released pop and dance records in the 1980s.One night in late 1990 or early 1991, she ran into Mr. Simmons at a club, and he invited her back to his apartment to discuss her career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think anything of going,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, having been there many times without incident.This time, though, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it all got really ugly, pretty fast,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. As soon as they entered, Mr. Simmons started pouring drinks and trying to kiss her, leading to a scuffle, she said. She recalled ‚<U+0080><U+009C>him on top of me, pushing me down and him saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fight me,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. She was pinned on the bed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I did nothing, I shut my eyes and waited for it to end.‚<U+0080>ùShe cried the whole way home, she said. In interviews and email, her ex-husband, Arthur Baker, a music producer; her psychologist, Dr. Robin Goldberg; another therapist; and a former roommate all confirmed that she told them she was raped.Mr. Simmons, through his lawyer, said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no recollection of ever having any sexual relations with Ms. Baker.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the assault, Ms. Baker remained tethered to Mr. Simmons professionally, she said. She returned to his apartment for a meeting; Mr. Simmons liked to conduct business while working out in his penthouse. But as soon as he stopped exercising, she said, he pulled out his penis and moved toward her. She fled.Amid strife with her label, she tried to extricate herself from her contract with Mr. Simmons, she said, but he ignored her. Her music ‚<U+0080><U+0094> two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> worth of songwriting and recording ‚<U+0080><U+0094> languished. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a deep depression,‚<U+0080>ù she said, and her recording career foundered.Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did everything he could to professionally promote her career‚<U+0080>ù while Ms. Baker was signed to a label, and then stopped representing her, according to his lawyer.The events took a heavy toll on her romantic relationships. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have sex with a man for almost nine years,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Baker, now a lawyer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a cocoon.‚<U+0080>ùDrew Dixon left Stanford University in 1992 to join the hip-hop revolution.After about two years on the fringes of the business, Ms. Dixon ‚<U+0080><U+0094> whose mother, Sharon Pratt, was mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 until 1995 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had a professional breakthrough: Russell Simmons, whom she had met through friends, was looking for a new A&R executive at Def Jam to scout talent and coordinate hit records.She said he was a decadent figure, complete with a Rolls-Royce ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>living, breathing personification of hip-hop and glamour mixed up‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and his sexual advances started right away and became relentless. At a restaurant, Mr. Simmons pushed Ms. Dixon into a broom closet, she said, and tried to kiss her. At work, he would close the door to her office and expose himself, leading her to give a copy of her key to a male co-worker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>If I ever buzz you, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pick up, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t call me back ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just open my door. That means Russell is in here and he whipped his‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù penis out, she said.Through his lawyer, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he engaged in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>inappropriate conduct‚<U+0080>ù with Ms. Dixon while she worked at Def Jam.Fending him off ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was a full-time job,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Ms. Dixon knew Mr. Simmons valued her expertise. She had an ear for emerging talent, even bringing a rising Notorious B.I.G. to the office.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cut off my one conduit to having any hope of a career,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought if I could survive long enough to have a hit ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a real bona fide hit with my name on it ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I would move categories,‚<U+0080>ù from sexual object to respected colleague.In 1995, Ms. Dixon thought she had found her lifeline. Her first major project ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a soundtrack for the music documentary ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show,‚<U+0080>ù featuring Tupac and A Tribe Called Quest ‚<U+0080><U+0094> went platinum. She and Mr. Simmons were listed as executive producers.One night, as she left the Bowery Bar near Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apartment to get cab money from an A.T.M., she ran into him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have the No. 1 record in the country; I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll order you a car,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled him saying.Waiting for the ride, she let her guard down and entered his apartment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I remember realizing I was cornered,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Dixon, who said she rejected Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual advances that night directly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>many ways to say no‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as well as explaining that she had just had a gynecological procedure and could not have sex. He told her he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and I just blacked out.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The last thing I remember was him pinning me down to kiss me on the bed,‚<U+0080>ù she said. The next thing she recalled was being in Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hot tub, both of them naked and Mr. Simmons gleeful. (Ms. Dixon said she had not been drinking and did not think she had been drugged; rather, she said, she had disassociated from the experience.)Denise Gayle, a friend who was then staying with Ms. Dixon, recalled her coming home in a daze. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She pretty much told me right away that he had sexually assaulted her, that she had told him no, cried and that he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be interested in stopping,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Gayle said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She mentally deteriorated instantly.‚<U+0080>ù Three others confirmed that Ms. Dixon told them about the assault and harassment around that time.Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+009C>emphatically states that he did not have sex with her,‚<U+0080>ù his lawyer said.Soon after, Ms. Dixon said she composed her resignation letter to Def Jam by hand, humiliated and in a panic, crossing out her mistakes rather than starting again. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was going to give up,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Dixon considered escaping to graduate school. But the success of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show‚<U+0080>ù soundtrack had made her taste a commodity, and she started at Arista Records, as an A&R executive under Clive Davis, in 1996. She enjoyed more success, helping to orchestrate smash singles like Whitney Houston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My Love Is Your Love,‚<U+0080>ù Aretha Franklin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Rose Is Still a Rose,‚<U+0080>ù and Santana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maria Maria.‚<U+0080>ùBut even at Arista, the long shadow of Def Jam remained, partly over a dispute about what she said were unpaid business expenses. Ms. Dixon hired a lawyer and threatened to sue Mr. Simmons for sexual harassment, as well as outstanding bills from the label. In 1997, the parties settled out of court. Mr. Rose, Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, confirmed the settlement.Ms. Dixon said she accepted about $30,000 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> around $3,000 for the expenses and the rest for legal fees ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and stayed quiet. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I do not want to be famous for being sexually harassed by Russell Simmons,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said, citing the lingering criticism of black women like Anita Hill, and Desiree Washington, who accused Mike Tyson of rape. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to make records and be famous for that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Dixon hoped to move on with her career at Arista. But in 2000, L.A. Reid replaced Mr. Davis atop the label. Mr. Reid began sexualizing her, Ms. Dixon said, and would turn cold when she denied his unwanted overtures.Ms. Dixon said she tried to parry his come-ons as best she could without offending him. But when she openly defied his demands ‚<U+0080><U+0094> declining his invitation to meet him late at night at his hotel; wearing jeans when he insisted on skirts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she worried that her artists would receive short shrift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a quid pro quo: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have power, you want access, sleep with me ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m going to be really mean to you the next day. And there will be consequences,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Reid left this year as the chairman of Epic Records following accusations of sexual harassment. Told in detail of Ms. Dixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, he said in a statement to The Times: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.‚<U+0080>ùIn 2002, at the top of her game, Ms. Dixon left the music industry for Harvard Business School. She concluded that no matter how many hits she had, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I could not have success in this industry unless I slept with somebody ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a gatekeeper,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that I would be doing it to advance my career, I would hate myself.‚<U+0080>ùPost-Def Jam, Mr. Simmons rebranded his image from high-rolling modelizer, partying with Donald Trump and Naomi Campbell, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Uncle Rush,‚<U+0080>ù a spiritual yogi and elder statesman. He released books like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Success Through Stillness‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Happy Vegan,‚<U+0080>ù while focusing on philanthropy and political advocacy.Ms. Dixon said that years after her experience with Mr. Simmons at Def Jam, he apologized to her at an industry event. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have daughters and I do yoga now, Drew, and I know what I did was wrong, and I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.Yet this Mr. Simmons is not the one that Christina Moore said she encountered in Miami at Art Basel in 2014. Ms. Moore, who was 26 at the time, and a friend bumped into Mr. Simmons in the elevator of Soho Beach House.The women were meeting friends at a bar there, but were lost, Ms. Moore said. Mr. Simmons suggested he knew where to go. Ms. Moore and her friend followed him; he led them to his room. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt duped,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Immediately, Mr. Simmons began to run a bath, Ms. Moore said, and then pushed her up against a column in the room ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hands all over my body, up and down,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt assaulted.‚<U+0080>ù He told Ms. Moore that she was a bad girl and threatened to tie her up, she said. Ms. Moore and her friend bolted.Mr. Simmons recalled meeting Ms. Moore and her friend. He said the women followed him to his room of their own accord and asked him about getting into parties. His lawyer said running the bath was Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>signal to Ms. Moore and her friend to leave.‚<U+0080>ù He denied any misconduct.The whole interaction lasted about five minutes, Ms. Moore said, but it stayed with her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt a lot of shame and guilt at ending up in that situation,‚<U+0080>ù she said.When reports of Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged sexual misconduct began circulating, Ms. Moore grew more alarmed and decided to come forward. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would hate to think what would have happened if I were alone,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Baker, too, spent years feeling guilt over how she handled the situation with Mr. Simmons. After the Weinstein revelations, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I started to get very agitated and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, scanning for mentions of misconduct by Mr. Simmons. She concluded that she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>moral duty‚<U+0080>ù to tell her story.Ms. Sallie said speaking out was a form of affirmation, and relief. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I still cry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. But, she added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m happy that the truth is coming out. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m ready.‚<U+0080>ùThe professional price Ms. Dixon paid was steep, she said. She cannot listen to the taste-shifting music she helped create; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too emotionally taxing. Her promising career was curtailed, her ear for talent wasted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I gave up something that I loved to do,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I erased myself.‚<U+0080>ùNow, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want people to know why.‚<U+0080>ùMAIDUGURI, Nigeria ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The camp was supposed to be a refuge. Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been stolen by war ever since the sixth grade, when she was abducted from her home and raped repeatedly by Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fighters for the next three years.She finally escaped last spring, slipping into the bush while her captors slept. Fourteen years old and alone, she made it to a camp for victims of the war, and had just settled in for the night when she heard footsteps outside her tent. A security officer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice instructed her to come out. Frightened, she obeyed.He took her to his quarters, she said, and raped her.Hours later, after she had returned to her tent, another officer arrived, she said. He raped her, too.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The same day I was brought there, soldiers started coming to rape me,‚<U+0080>ù Falmata said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They did it one after another. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure those two knew about each other.‚<U+0080>ùRape has been a defining horror of the war with Boko Haram, which has consumed northeastern Nigeria for eight years and spread beyond its borders. At least 7,000 women and girls have endured Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual violence, the United Nations estimates. Militants kidnap and rape young girls, teenagers and women, handing them out as so-called brides who are sometimes passed from fighter to fighter.But Nigerian security forces have also raped victims of the war, preying on the people they are assigned to protect. Dozens of cases of rape, sexual violence and sexual exploitation were reported in seven camps in Borno State last year alone, carried out by guards, camp officials, security officers and members of civilian vigilante groups, the United Nations says.More than a year ago, the Nigerian government pledged to investigate the allegations of rape in camps for people displaced by the war, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>these very distressing reports will not be taken lightly.‚<U+0080>ù But accounts of sexual assaults in the camps are still common, including from young girls who say they were raped by soldiers on many occasions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The soldiers would come and hold me so tight,‚<U+0080>ù one 13-year-old girl said in an interview. She said she had been raped about 10 times this year at a camp in Maiduguri, the city at the center of the fight against Boko Haram, before running away for her own safety.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They were old enough to be my parents,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the soldiers who raped her.The Nigerian military has cleared parts of the countryside to hunt for Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hide-outs, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to move into huge settlements throughout northeastern Nigeria. Many other civilians have made it to the camps on their own after fleeing Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deadly assaults.Most of the camps are overflowing, with new arrivals every day. Food and water are often in short supply, residents say, and health workers are battling a cholera outbreak that has killed dozens.At night, the camps are dimly lit. Aid workers come during the day, but typically not after sunset because of wartime curfews. Security forces tightly control who goes in and out of the camps, sometimes coercing women and girls to trade sex for food.Government officials say they need 24-hour security to protect the residents, especially since some of the camps are regular targets of suicide bombers deployed by Boko Haram.But in one camp, called Teachers Village, some residents said the security forces had worked out a system to select their victims. Young women were called to cook for them. After the women finished, security officers insisted that they clean up, telling them to go bathe in the officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> quarters as the men watched.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At first none of us knew they were doing this, but then the stories started to spread around camp that anyone cooking for them would be raped,‚<U+0080>ù said Hadiza, 18.After living in the camp for several weeks, Hadiza said, she was picked to cook for the officers. She was terrified.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Definitely my time has come,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled thinking.Later, she was asked to serve water to four security officers in their room as they dined. One by one they left, she said, until only one man remained. He dragged her into a separate room and raped her, she said.Hadiza was injured, she said, but didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ask for medical care, fearing that the officers would seek revenge. She said she tried to keep a low profile for a couple of weeks, but officers spotted her and raped her again. She said she had been raped as many as 20 times in the camp.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once they identified you as a girl they wanted to have sex with, they would hardly leave you alone a single day,‚<U+0080>ù Hadiza said.By spring, word of the rapes at Teachers Village camp had spread so widely across Maiduguri that people began showing up at the gates to look for missing relatives. Distant relatives arrived for Hadiza and took her away.Last year, President Muhammadu Buhari called for an investigation into sexual assaults at the camps after Human Rights Watch detailed the abuse in a report, ordering new measures to protect the vulnerable. Security officers have received more training, and at least 100 female officers have been deployed inside the camps. As a result, the number of complaints of sexual abuse has declined, according to some aid groups and the police.The police have arrested several men for sexually abusing and exploiting women and girls, according to the United States Embassy. The arrests, made last December, include two police officers, a prison warden, two civilian militia members, a civil servant and three soldiers.But an Army Special Board of Inquiry said in June that allegations against its soldiers at the camps were unfounded, while Jimoh Moshood, a police spokesman, said the investigations were continuing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Very little progress has been made by Nigerian authorities to implement President Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s promise of justice for the survivors,‚<U+0080>ù said Mausi Segun, the executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The delay reinforces displaced people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sense of helplessness, and likely emboldens more perpetrators to prey on their vulnerability.‚<U+0080>ùIn the war with Boko Haram, Nigerian security forces have been accused of many human rights abuses, including killing innocent civilians and detaining children for months to determine their loyalties.At checkpoints to enter Maiduguri, soldiers and militia members have turned away large groups of displaced people fleeing Boko Haram, unless they can pay an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>entrance fee,‚<U+0080>ù aid workers say. People escaping with their herds are sometimes charged a fee for each animal. Those who can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pay the bribes have been sent back into harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.Inside the camps, soldiers and members of civilian vigilante groups have been accused of forcing people to pay for the privilege of setting up tents or leaky shelters made of tarps and grass. Some displaced people told Amnesty International that they had to sell their belongings to survive, and when they ran out of things to sell, they had to have sex with soldiers and civilian militia members to get food.Falmata, the 14-year-old kidnapped by Boko Haram, said her ordeal began when she was in primary school, enjoying her classwork and dancing to local Kanuri music.Militants stormed into her home and took her while she was caring for her sick mother. They forced her to marry a fighter, but that man died in battle a week later, so they gave her to another husband. She tried to resist, so they gave her a third. Barely a teenager by then, she became pregnant, she said, but the baby died days after he was born.One night, Falmata woke up and realized the whole camp was asleep. Now was the time, she thought. She ran until she reached a village, finding an older woman with a lantern who pointed her to a road. Soldiers spotted her and took her to Dalori Camp, a sprawling site outside Maiduguri.She thought she was being delivered to safety ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but immediately faced the same kind of sexual abuse she had risked her life to flee. And this time it was being committed by the people who were there to protect her.During her two months at the camp, she said, security officers, not always the same men, came for her repeatedly. Falmata described the men as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>soldiers,‚<U+0080>ù but it was unclear if they were members of the military, the police or another security force. She said they carried weapons.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt it would continue forever,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the abuse.She knew she had to flee, again, so she asked for a pass to go to the market. She walked out of the camp the same way she had escaped Boko Haram: alone, with no money and no idea where she was going.As a little girl, she remembered, she had visited her grandmother once in Maiduguri, but she had only a vague idea where. Falmata spotted a man she had seen around the camp who spoke her dialect, and begged for help.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look, I have a problem,‚<U+0080>ù she told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>These people are going to kill me. They come to me every night.‚<U+0080>ùThe two drove around the city for hours, trying to track down Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s grandmother, asking everyone. Eventually, they found her. She had thought Falmata was dead.Falmata now lives with her grandmother, but is too ashamed to tell her what happened. Someday, she hopes to continue her education and become a lawyer. She wants to represent the powerless.The 17-year-old migrant was pregnant. She said she had been raped in her home county, and she knew from the timing that she was carrying her attacker‚<U+0080><U+0099>s child.She wanted to terminate her pregnancy. But she was underage and undocumented, and, after she was caught crossing the border illegally, living in a government shelter.The Trump administration official in charge of her care decided not to grant her access to an abortion ‚<U+0080><U+0094> because, he said, abortion was itself a form of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>violence.‚<U+0080>ùA woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s desire to end a pregnancy springing from rape might be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understandable,‚<U+0080>ù wrote Scott Lloyd, the director of the federal agency that oversees the shelter, in his denial memo on Sunday. But, he wrote, it was not possible to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cure violence with further violence.‚<U+0080>ùHe went on: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We cannot be a place of refuge while we are at the same time a place of violence. We have to choose, and we ought to choose protect life rather than to destroy it.‚<U+0080>ùIt took a lawsuit, a federal court order and an unexpected reversal this week for Jane Poe, as the teenager is known in court papers, to secure access to an abortion. Yet Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo, released by government lawyers in court on Thursday, spells out a fervently uncompromising opposition to abortion that all but guarantees further clashes at the charged intersection of abortion and immigration.The agency Mr. Lloyd leads, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, announced in March that it would prohibit federally funded shelters from taking ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any action that facilitates‚<U+0080>ù an abortion for an unaccompanied minor without his approval. The Trump administration has said that there is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no constitutional right‚<U+0080>ù for young women in the office‚<U+0080><U+0099>s custody to obtain an abortion.The director has personally gone to meet with pregnant teenagers in immigration custody to persuade them not to have abortions, drawing accusations from abortion rights advocates that he is forcing his beliefs onto the young women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This latest revelation exposes the Trump administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s extreme anti-abortion ideology: It seeks to force women to continue pregnancies against their will,‚<U+0080>ù said Brigitte Amiri, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented Jane Poe and two other teenagers who also won the rights to get abortions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will continue to fight to strike down this cruel and heartless policy.‚<U+0080>ùOn Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agency declined to comment on his views on abortion. In October, a spokesman told The Washington Post: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a child in the program who is pregnant, he has been reaching out to her and trying to help as much as possible with life-affirming options.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He by law has custody of these children,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman continued, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and just like a foster parent, he knows that that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot of responsibility, and he is going to make choices that he thinks are best for both the mother and the child.‚<U+0080>ùThe Trump administration had originally opposed a federal judge‚<U+0080><U+0099>s order on Monday to allow Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abortion. Then, for reasons it has not explained, it dropped its legal appeal, clearing Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s path. (She still faces the possibility of deportation.)Government lawyers had pushed to keep Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sealed in court, but agreed to release part of it on Thursday after the A.C.L.U. argued for its unsealing. The group has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy.Though Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers have disclosed almost no information about her out of concerns for her safety and privacy, Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sketches the outlines of her situation. She told shelter workers that she had been raped in her home country, and though she had a boyfriend with whom she had had sex, both she and federal officials came to believe, based on the timing of her assault, that her pregnancy resulted from the rape. She arrived at the border several weeks after the attack.When the shelter confirmed that she was pregnant, she asked for an abortion, only to change her mind after she said her mother had threatened to beat her if she got one. A few days later, however, she decided that she wanted it, and later threatened to hurt herself if she did not receive it. She was nearly 22 weeks pregnant when Mr. Lloyd said no.Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo describes the abortion procedure, known as dilation and evacuation, that she would have to undergo at that stage of pregnancy as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one that even many abortionists find troublesome.‚<U+0080>ù He cites anecdotal evidence, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>impossible to ignore,‚<U+0080>ù that abortions can be a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating trauma‚<U+0080>ù for women, even as he concedes that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>formal research on this matter appears to be sparse.‚<U+0080>ù An abortion would not only fail to erase her trauma, he wrote, but also might ‚<U+0080><U+009C>further traumatize her.‚<U+0080>ùBecause many immigrants are sexually assaulted in their home countries or on the journey through Central America and Mexico to the southern border, cases like Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s are likely to recur.A Gallup poll this year showed that 18 percent of Americans believe that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, a share that has not changed significantly for many years. Half of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances and 29 percent said it should always be legal, according to the poll.The House recently passed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, a measure the White House supports, but it contains an exception for cases of rape. It is unlikely to pass the Senate, where most Democrats and some Republicans generally oppose new laws restricting abortions.KABUL, Afghanistan ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Taliban on Sunday denied an assertion by a freed Canadian hostage that his American wife had been raped during their five years of captivity and that their infant had been killed by the Haqqani network, a brutal arm of the Afghan insurgency.The militants said the child had died during a miscarriage.Soon after arriving in Toronto on Friday with his wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their three children, the former captive, Joshua Boyle, said she had been raped by members of the Haqqani network.He also said the network had authorized ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the murder of my infant daughter,‚<U+0080>ù their fourth child. Ms. Coleman was pregnant when the couple were abducted in 2012 while traveling in Afghanistan.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, rejected the accusations of rape as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fabricated claims‚<U+0080>ù fed to Mr. Boyle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From the beginning up to their freedom, the wife and the husband were not separated even for a few minutes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the reason for that was to avoid any suspicions,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman said by telephone.When Ms. Coleman was about to deliver the child, Mr. Mujahid said, there were no doctors in the area where they were being held.‚<U+0080><U+009C>One female child was naturally miscarried,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mujahid said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No one has intentionally killed the child or carried out any other abuse on them. If that was our plan, they would not have gone home with three children.‚<U+0080>ùMany questions about the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s travels to Afghanistan, their captivity and their eventual release remain unanswered. Several members of the Taliban leadership reached by phone repeated the lines put out in their statement without offering new details.Mr. Mujahid also declined to talk about how the couple had been freed, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>only the few people guarding them‚<U+0080>ù had details of the release and that he was still trying to reach those people.Pakistani officials have said that the family was freed in northwestern tribal areas of the country after their forces acted on intelligence provided to them by the United States.At a news conference, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman for the Pakistani military, said its forces had managed to trace the vehicle carrying the hostages within five hours of a tip from the United States, and had rescued the hostages after blowing out the vehicle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tires. The captors ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fled on foot,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Boyle, in a video message posted by the Pakistani military soon after their freedom, effusively thanked the Pakistani military for a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tremendously professional operation,‚<U+0080>ù and said the military and intelligence forces ‚<U+0080><U+009C>got between the car and the criminals to make sure the prisoners were safe and that my family was safe.‚<U+0080>ùAmerican officials have expressed gratitude to Pakistan for the release, and President Trump called it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a positive moment‚<U+0080>ù in the countries‚<U+0080><U+0099> relationship. The release came as pressure by the Trump administration seemed to be mounting on Pakistan for its ties to the Afghan insurgency.American officials have said repercussions could be severe if Pakistan failed to curtail its support for the Afghan insurgency, and in particular, continue to allow a haven for its leaders, including the Haqqanis.But Afghan officials in Kabul viewed the hostage release as an old Pakistani trick of offering the United States a concession each time the pressure builds. A senior Afghan official said that two and a half years ago, its intelligence service had concluded that the family had been moved across the border into Pakistan, and that the information had been shared with the Americans.In recent years, the Haqqani network has become increasingly integrated with the mainstream Taliban. The network‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, serves as the Taliban‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy supreme leader and has played an important role in the insurgency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s military victories.But the network still maintains its special skills, including hostage-taking and carrying out some of the more sophisticated attacks and bombings in cities like Kabul. The group previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, one of Sirajuddin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s half brothers, in exchange for the freedom of the North American family.The Haqqanis are believed to be still holding Kevin King, a professor of the American University of Afghanistan who was kidnapped in Kabul in 2016; and another American, Paul Overby, whose family said the Haqqanis abducted him in 2014 after he tried to interview the group‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùDREW DIXON, a former executive at Def Jam Records, who said fending off advances from the label‚<U+0080><U+0099>s co-founder Russell Simmons was a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>full-time job.‚<U+0080>ù She has accused Mr. Simmons of sexual assault.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A growing national outcry over sexual harassment reached the Senate on Thursday, when a radio newscaster accused Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office.Mr. Franken, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, almost immediately released an apology to the newscaster, Leeann Tweeden, who said that Mr. Franken forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal and groped her for a photo as she slept. After initially apologizing without fully acknowledging all of her accusations, he then released another lengthier, more contrite statement that contested nothing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Franken wrote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I respect women. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t respect men who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t,‚<U+0080>ù he continued. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.‚<U+0080>ùThe storm that enveloped Mr. Franken in a matter of hours marked a merger of sorts between the harassment scandals darkening the political world and the grave misconduct marring the entertainment industry. Republicans are still struggling to resolve their quandary with Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.President Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and has refrained from weighing in on the accusations against Mr. Moore, wrote on Twitter late Thursday that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued the tweet in a cruder manner: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?‚<U+0080>ùEarlier, response from Republicans and Democrats alike was swift and unsparing. Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the Senate leaders, wasted no time before forwarding the matter to the Senate Ethics Committee ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a move supported by Democrats, including Mr. Franken. Lawmakers did stop short of meting out a punishment on a fellow senator, and it appeared that Mr. Franken would be able to weather the disclosure.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in the workplace or anywhere else.‚<U+0080>ùDemocrats gave Mr. Franken no quarter.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is unacceptable behavior and extremely disappointing. I am glad Al came out and apologized, but that doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t reverse what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done or end the matter. I support an ethics committee investigation into these accusations and I hope this latest example of the deep problems on this front spurs continued action to address it,‚<U+0080>ù said Patty Murray of Washington, one of the most senior Democratic women in the Senate.The realm of comedy, which spawned the charges against Louis C.K., has been particularly suspect, and Mr. Franken, who emerged from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù as a nationally known celebrity, appeared to acknowledge that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coming from the world of comedy, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the intentions behind my actions aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the point at all. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taken me so long to come to terms with that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Tweeden published a first-person account of the incident on KABC Radio in Los Angeles on Thursday. She wrote that it occurred in December 2006, not long before Christmas, when she was a performer for the tour alongside Mr. Franken, then a well-known comedian. Ms. Tweeden was then a Fox Sports Network correspondent and model. U.S.O. tours are meant to boost morale among American troops abroad and typically include celebrity entertainment.She also presented evidence, including a photograph of Mr. Franken, his head turned toward the camera, with his hands placed over Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breasts as she slept.According to Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, Mr. Franken wrote a bawdy script that included a kiss for the two to perform onstage. When it came time to rehearse the skit, she wrote, Mr. Franken insisted on kissing despite her protestations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be so nice about it the next time,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt disgusted and violated,‚<U+0080>ù she added.Ms. Tweeden said that no one else witnessed the kiss, and she did not tell the tour‚<U+0080><U+0099>s organizers. She said Mr. Franken retaliated against her with insults and, she learned after the trip ended, the compromising photograph.Ms. Tweeden said the photograph was taken while she was asleep on a flight back to the United States from Afghanistan and that she saw it only later, after the trip ended.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s funny?‚<U+0080>ùSpeaking on air on KABC Thursday morning, Ms. Tweeden, a former model, said that women were too often blamed for provoking male aggression based on their looks or clothing. She told reporters later that she would accept Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apology.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The apology? Sure. I accept it,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People make mistakes.‚<U+0080>ùAsked if she would call on Mr. Franken to step down, Ms. Tweeden said no, barring the emergence of new accusations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not my place,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Tweeden wrote that she had been compelled to share the story after an on-air conversation with Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, who has been a leading voice sounding alarms about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill in recent weeks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to have the same effect on them that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want them, and all the other victims of sexual assault, to be able to speak out immediately, and not keep their stories ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and their anger ‚<U+0080><U+0094> locked up inside for years, or decades.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Speier and others have labored to force Congress to begin grappling with sexual aggression that has long been a part of work life on Capitol Hill. She testified at a House hearing on the topic on Tuesday that helped draw increased scrutiny of the sort that has already begun to take place in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and newsrooms in New York and Washington.Mr. Trump has also been accused of sexual harassment. Shortly before the presidential election last year, a 2005 recording surfaced that showed Mr. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about women. The recording captured Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and bragging that he could get away with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>anything‚<U+0080>ù because of his celebrity.Others have recounted unwelcome romantic advances and unsettling workplace conduct, including at the offices of Trump Tower and backstage at beauty pageants.Even before the accusations against Mr. Franken, lawmakers in both the Senate and House had moved to begin mandatory anti-harassment training for all Capitol Hill employees and interns.Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story came one day after Ms. Speier and four other lawmakers, including Representative Ryan Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Representative Bruce Poliquin, Republican of Maine, introduced legislation to overhaul the way sexual harassment and assault are reported in Congress.Congressional aides, lawyers and lobbyists say the existing system is convoluted, and has long been stacked against those wishing to speak out against an abuser: The current process requires nondisclosure agreements and can take up to six months before a formal complaint is filed.The proposed legislation would make anonymity optional, as well as require lawmakers to reimburse the United States Treasury for paying out any settlements to victims.While his fellow senators rushed to rebuke him, Mr. Franken hunkered down out of sight, skipping four votes in the Senate and the Democrats‚<U+0080><U+0099> regularly scheduled luncheon.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fellow Minnesota Democrat, condemned his actions and like other senators called for an Ethics Committee query.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This should not have happened to Leeann Tweeden,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Klobuchar said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another example of why we need to change work environments and reporting practices across the nation, including in Congress.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Johnny Isakson, the Ethics Committee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Republican chairman, cited committee rules in saying that he could not comment on a prospective investigation.Republicans, eager to talk about sexual accusations other than Mr. Moore‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, tried to turn the allegations to their political favor. The campaign committees of Republican Senate and House candidates sent out a blizzard of news releases demanding that Democrats denounce Mr. Franken and return campaign contributions that he had made.Lisbeth Kaufman, who worked for Mr. Franken during his first term while she was in her mid-20s, said Mr. Franken never behaved inappropriately in the office to her knowledge, and recalled him as a focused and intelligent lawmaker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are predators on the Hill for sure,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kaufman, 31, said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And there are so many terrible stories. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard them myself. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve never heard such stories about Senator Franken.‚<U+0080>ùRussell Simmons has once again been accused of rape. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.In the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.The complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vehemently‚<U+0080>ù denied all of the allegations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests.‚<U+0080>ùOver the past few months, Mr. Simmons has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault or rape by multiple women, and is the focus of a police investigation in New York City. In January, an aspiring filmmaker named Jennifer Jarosik filed a $5 million lawsuit that claimed Mr. Simmons attacked her during a 2016 visit to his home. He stepped down from his companies in November.DETROIT ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A former Michigan State University dean, who supervised the doctor at the center of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, was himself charged on Tuesday with criminal sexual conduct involving medical school students.A student at the College of Osteopathic Medicine accused William Strampel, 70, of forcible sexual contact, prosecutors said in papers filed in state district court in East Lansing. Prosecutors said other students also accused Strampel of sexual misconduct.The charges emerged during a probe into how Michigan State handled complaints about the gymnastics doctor, special prosecutor William Forsyth told reporters in Lansing. The focus widened after investigators received a tip.The new charges, which Strampel's attorney denied, make the university a bigger target for the ""#MeToo"" movement that has engulfed powerful men across society in harassment and abuse allegations.""We did what we felt we needed to do and it led us to where we are today,"" Forsyth said.Strampel was dean from 2002 until the end of 2017. He supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar, who has been sentenced to prison for sexually abusing female gymnasts.The four criminal counts against Nassar's former boss include fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The accusations also include failing to properly oversee Nassar, whose scandal sparked probes into why the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and the university failed for years to investigate complaints.After a short hearing in state court in East Lansing, Strampel's attorney John Dakmak told reporters, ""My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone. He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors.""Regarding the charges relating to Strampel's supervision of Nassar, Dakmak said his client immediately involved other school officials in 2014 when the complaints surfaced and fired Nassar in 2016 when the sexual assault allegations were made.Michigan State's interim President John Engler said in a statement that one of his first actions upon his appointment in early February was moving to fire Strampel. Engler called the allegations against the former dean ""disturbing.""""Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges confirm our belief that he has fallen short of what is expected and required from academic leadership,"" Engler said.Four female medical students told investigators Strampel made sexually suggestive comments during meetings, including what some perceived as academic privileges in exchange for sex. Two accused him of grabbing their buttocks without consent.One student described meeting with Strampel in June 2017 to appeal a test score and feeling intimidated when he mentioned her age, saying: ""26-year-old women can 'put out' for 20 minutes with an old man ... and in return the women could get the benefit of a free vacation,"" according to court documents.Another witness said Strampel suggested she become a centerfold model and related to her how another student had become a stripper to pay for school, court documents said.When Strampel agreed to let the student retake a test, he said she must agree to do anything for him, which she interpreted as a request for sex, court documents said.Strampel is also accused of using his position as dean to receive pornographic images of women ""through threats and manipulation,"" court documents said. They said investigators seized his computer in February and found about 50 photos of nude women, sex toys and pornography, including selfies of female students, pornographic videos and a video of Nassar performing ""treatment"" on a young female patient.Strampel, handcuffed hands clasped in his lap and his legs crossed, appeared at his arraignment via video feed. A split screen showed him expressing little emotion as he interacted with the judge.Judge Richard Ball, citing a lack of criminal history, set a $25,000 personal recognizance bond, meaning Strampel need not post a cash bond. A preliminary hearing is set for May 3.If convicted, he faces five years and a possible fine of $10,000 for a misconduct in office charge, two years and a possible fine of $500 for the fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charge and one year and a possible fine of $1,000 for each of the two willful neglect of duty charges, according to court documents.An attorney for more than 150 of Nassar's victims said his clients were encouraged by the charges against Strampel.The charges demonstrate that officials are ""serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at MSU that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history and holding the responsible parties accountable,"" John Manly said in a statement.Michigan State has been criticized for its handling of Nassar, 54, who was a faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic. Athletes had complained about Nassar since the 1990s, but the school did not open an investigation until 2014.Nassar was fired in September 2016. He received sentences this year that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life.(Additional reporting by Rebecca Cook in East Lansing, Michigan, Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by David Gregorio)OTTAWA ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Joshua Boyle, the Canadian man who was held hostage along with his American wife in Afghanistan for five years, has been arrested and faces 15 criminal charges, court records show.The charges include sexual assault, forcible confinement, drugging and assault, and all involve events that happened after Mr. Boyle and his family returned to Canada in mid-October. Court documents show that Mr. Boyle was arrested on Monday.Since being freed by Pakistani troops along with his wife, Caitlan Coleman Boyle, and their three children who were born in captivity, Mr. Boyle has described several gruesome episodes that he said occurred during their captivity. Among other things, he said that members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network raped Ms. Coleman and killed their fourth child, an infant.Ms. Coleman Boyle has said that the captors beat their eldest son.It is still unclear why the couple took what many viewed as an exceedingly dangerous trip into an unstable region of Afghanistan during 2012.The first of the events that led to the charges Mr. Boyle now faces, according to court documents, occurred on Oct. 14, and the most recent was on Dec. 30. The charges include misleading the police.A court order prohibits the publishing of anything that might identify the two people who the Ottawa Police say were Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.The Ottawa Police declined to comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mr. Boyle is presumed innocent,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Eric Granger, wrote in an email on Tuesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s never been in trouble before. No evidence has been provided yet, which is typical at this early stage.‚<U+0080>ùAfter their release in a dramatic raid, the family initially moved in with Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario, about an hour from Ottawa. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Boyle was living in an apartment in downtown Ottawa, court records show.Mr. Boyle, 34, was previously, and briefly, married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of Omar Khadr, the only Canadian held by the United States military in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. He also acted as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s spokesman.Canadian courts found that Mr. Khadr, who was 15 when captured, was unjustly held. He was offered a formal apology by the Canadian government and agreed to a substantial monetary settlement last year. But Ms. Khadr has been widely rebuked by Canadian politicians and others for many of her public statements, including a defense of terrorism.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a dusty, overheated rehearsal room near London Bridge, things were getting ghoulish. On a mocked-up stage set, a soprano wearing a mask with black buttons over her eyeholes was slamming a fake hand into a door, trying to make it look as if it had been severed. Around a table, two ‚<U+0080><U+009C>magic consultants‚<U+0080>ù were huddled around a miniature toy theater, debating what sort of fake mice would freak audiences out the most. Eerie, discordant chords drifted from another room: A trio was practicing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doomed,‚<U+0080>ù they seemed to be singing.It was the fourth week of rehearsals for the Royal Opera‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new adaptation of Neil Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Gothic children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s novella ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù, and no bumps in the night were being left to chance. The seven singers had memorized Mark-Anthony Turnage‚<U+0080><U+0099>s angular, complex score and had worked out where to stand and walk; today was all about making sure that the supernatural transformations required by Rory Mullarkey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s libretto happened where they were meant to. The piece presented an unusual number of challenges, sighed Aletta Collins, the director: Never before had she been required to work out how to throw someone through a mirror onstage, as happens at the climax of the action, let alone how one might recruit a mouse orchestra, which pops up in Act One.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing our level best,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In the 16 years since it was published, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline,‚<U+0080>ù a tale of a plucky girl who falls into a parallel universe and battles forces from the dark side, has developed a passionate fan base, selling more than a million copies. In 2009 there came a stop-motion movie, and there have been video game and comic book adaptations, too ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even an Off Broadway musical. Propelled by this, and by the astonishing success of other stories, such as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sandman‚<U+0080>ù series and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Gods,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman has become something of a cult figure, not just among the Comic-Con crowd, but in mainstream literary circles, too.Even so, the idea of making a fantasy novel into an avant-garde opera still seems like a leap ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not only because of the mice. But then Mr. Turnage has always had eclectic taste: His last opera, which had its debut seven years ago, focused on the wayward life and tranquilizer-fueled death of Anna Nicole Smith, and his orchestral and instrumental works have gleefully referenced Miles Davis, the paintings of Francis Bacon and Beyonc√©‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Single Ladies.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>If someone says you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, or shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, then I think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a very good reason to do it,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has to provoke me, otherwise I get bored.‚<U+0080>ùThough Mr. Gaiman hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been directly involved in this new version ‚<U+0080><U+0094> earlier this month he finished shooting a screen adaptation of his novel ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Omens,‚<U+0080>ù written with Terry Pratchett ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage and Mr. Mullarkey have had plenty to play with. The novel begins when little Coraline Jones discovers that a bricked-up door in the apartment she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s just moved into is a portal to a nightmarish ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other world.‚<U+0080>ù Trapped behind the door, she finds a figure with black buttons for eyes who coos that she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other mother‚<U+0080>ù and promises her anything she desires, if only she agrees to stay ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for ever and always.‚<U+0080>ù Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s journey home to her real parents is not only a coming-of-age story; it also becomes a mythic quest.A powerful, self-determined heroine, Coraline is more than a match for operatic heroines like Leonore in Beethoven‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fidelio‚<U+0080>ù or Rosina from Rossini‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Barber of Seville.‚<U+0080>ù The role is shared in the new production by the sopranos Mary Bevan and Robyn Allegra Parton.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a strong female character,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s powerful; she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to solve these things. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got a seven-year-old daughter. S he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too young to read the book, but she saw the film, and she was very taken with Coraline.‚<U+0080>ùAlthough the opera, like the novel, is aimed at young audiences ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage has dedicated it to his daughter and his youngest son ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it goes to some genuinely disturbing places. The sense that evil lurks around every corner is palpable; there are heavy hints, too, of abuse in the plotline of parent-like figures who bribe a child to love them. While critics have often compared the book to Lewis Carroll, Mr. Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s universe is arguably closer to David Lynch or Stephen King in its atmosphere of suspenseful, what-lies-beneath horror.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted to write about how people who have your best interests at heart may not always pay you the kind of attention that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And people who pay a lot of attention to you may not always have your best interests at heart.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Collins agreed that, despite its fairy-tale qualities, this narrative is not for the fainthearted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The story is: You can have anything you want in the whole wide world, as long as you let me sew buttons into your eyes,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Turnage clearly relishes the material‚<U+0080><U+0099>s otherworldly side; the score, written for 15 musicians, is astringent and occasionally violent, bringing to mind early chamber pieces such as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>On All Fours‚<U+0080>ù (1983) and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blood on the Floor‚<U+0080>ù (1996). But ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù does allow audiences some moments of fun. The composer said he enjoyed coming up with Broadway-ish music for the character of Mr. Bobo, an eccentric old man who dwells in the apartment above Coraline and conducts the mouse orchestra. Two retired actresses who live in the apartment beneath, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, are portrayed as divas of a certain age who issue Cassandra-like pronouncements about fate in high-voltage coloratura.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The fantasy element is so heightened,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Completely operatic.‚<U+0080>ùThe Royal Opera has staged eight new operas for young people and families in the last five years, among them Julian Philips‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How the Whale Became‚<U+0080>ù (2013), based on children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stories by Ted Hughes, and Adriano Adewale‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hatch‚<U+0080>ù (2017), billed as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sensory experience for children aged 2 to 5.‚<U+0080>ù The profusion indicates how seriously the company is trying to demolish the perceived barriers that surround the art form, and to attract new and more diverse audiences.The company is under continual pressure to justify its annual governmental subsidy of around $33 million annually ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the highest of any arts institution in Britain ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and has invested in co-productions with theater and dance companies around the country. It also runs school workshops and outreach projects in towns outside London, including in some of the region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most deprived areas.Mr. Turnage, who grew up in Essex, not far from London, and was the first member of his family to get a college education, said he hoped audiences for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù would come from all walks of life. The opera world sometimes wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t as outward-facing as it should be, he suggested.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A lot of opera directors are making opera for other opera directors, and quite a few opera composers are writing for their peer group,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Although ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù has been in development for over four years, both he and Ms. Collins said that the theme of a young woman standing up for herself against the odds had acquired particular topicality in the context of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The classical world has experienced plentiful rumors about sexual harassment, along with some high-profile firings ‚<U+0080><U+0094> notably of the conductors Charles Dutoit and James Levine, who was pushed out of the Met earlier this month.Mr. Turnage said that, while some things had improved over his years in the business, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m acutely aware of women working in the opera world and the way that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re marginalized, and how tough it is. Everybody knows this.‚<U+0080>ùHe added he was proud that, as well as having created a strong female lead, the production also has a largely female creative team, led by Ms. Collins and the conductor Sian Edwards. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The world is changing,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said.He added that he hoped ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù offered a path forward, in its way. He was inspired by a quotation from G.K. Chesterton that Mr. Gaiman uses as the epigraph of the book: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fairy tales are more than true: Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.‚<U+0080>ùGov. Andrew M. Cuomo directed the state attorney general on Monday to review how the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., handled a 2015 sexual assault allegation against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Mr. Vance decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein even though his accuser, an Italian model, had provided police officers with a recording of Mr. Weinstein apologizing when she asked him why he had groped her breasts the day before.Mr. Vance said at the time that there was insufficient evidence, a defense he repeated last year after an outpouring of accusations against Mr. Weinstein reopened scrutiny of the decision, and also cast light on Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s acceptance of campaign donations from Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are confident that any review will confirm that our office has pursued its investigation without fear or favor, based on the merits alone,‚<U+0080>ù Danny Frost, a spokesman for the district attorney, said in a statement on Monday evening. He said the office would provide the attorney general with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any necessary information.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement of the investigation, which will be conducted by Eric T. Schneiderman, came hours after Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up, the star-powered organization dedicated to fighting sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond, wrote a letter to the governor calling on him to open an investigation into Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is of great concern that sexual assault cases have not been pursued with full vigor by our criminal justice system,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement also came the same day that Cynthia Nixon, an actress and education activist, announced her candidacy for governor; Ms. Nixon, a Democrat, is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the left.Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office is currently investigating other claims against Mr. Weinstein, including that he twice raped the actress Paz de la Huerta. Mr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said the review of Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case would not interfere with those open investigations, which he said would conclude within about 45 days. Afterward, the statement said, Mr. Schneiderman would review the entire matter and decide if further action was warranted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are deeply familiar with Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s years of egregious sexual abuse, and recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against him alleging severe and persistent abuse of employees at The Weinstein Company,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are committed to pursuing a full, fair and independent review of this matter.‚<U+0080>ùReports of possible conflicts of interest between Mr. Vance and Mr. Weinstein have circulated since last October, when a deluge of accusations against Mr. Weinstein, once one of Hollywood‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful producers, sparked an international reckoning around sexual abuse. Two of the lawyers Mr. Weinstein retained after being brought in for questioning about his encounters with Ms. Battilana had personal and financial ties to Mr. Vance: Elkan Abramowitz was a former law partner of Mr. Vance and a donor to his campaign, and Daniel S. Connolly was a former prosecutor turned white-collar defense lawyer.Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers also brought on Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor and close friend of the head of the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex crimes bureau, as a consultant; she facilitated an introduction between Mr. Abramowitz and the bureau head, Martha Bashford.And David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein who hired a private investigative firm to dig up information in an attempt to stop The New York Times‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expose on his client, has given $55,000 to Mr. Vance over the years. Mr. Boies has said he never spoke to Mr. Vance about any criminal investigation of Mr. Weinstein.In Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, Ms. Bashford determined after two weeks of investigation that she could not prove the crime of forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse had been committed, even though she had the audio tape, Mr. Vance has said. Prosecutors judged it would be hard to prove Mr. Weinstein touched Ms. Battilana for sexual reasons because the advance came as the two were talking about Ms. Battilana becoming a lingerie model and whether her bosom had been surgically enhanced.Prosecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to pursue charges, and it is not uncommon for assistant district attorneys not to see eye-to-eye with detectives on the strength of a case. But the tensions over Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision in the case have exploded in recent months into an open feud between some detectives in the Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s special victims unit and the district attorney.For detectives, assembling enough evidence to establish that it is probable someone committed a crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known in law as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>probable cause‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is enough to make an arrest. Prosecutors, however, must take things further and prove every element of the crime in court, and that can often be a much higher bar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The police have a job to do, and we have a job to do, and they are very different jobs,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Vance said in an interview Monday night. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our job is to ensure that any case that we bring has proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard we have to meet in court. Any other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes. If you are trying cases where you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have the proof, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not going to be a satisfactory outcome for the survivor.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Vance also issued a joint statement with the police commissioner, James P. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Neill, in which he called his office and the Police Department ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fully committed partners in the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>From time to time we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have our disagreements, but we will never allow them to undermine this shared endeavor,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.Since its inception a quarter century ago, the independent city agency that investigates allegations of police abuse in New York City has done nothing more with complaints about sexual misconduct than send them to the Police Department. In the 18 months ending last June, 117 such allegations were funneled to the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internal Affairs Bureau, where findings remain hidden and any discipline of officers is cloaked in administrative secrecy.Now, however, as allegations about a wide spectrum of sexual misconduct ‚<U+0080><U+0094> from inappropriate comments to workplace coercion to sexual abuse and rape ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are roiling the country, the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, has added a layer of oversight to allegations of sexual harassment and abuse in policing.In a board meeting on Wednesday it adopted  a resolution from its staff to immediately investigate certain allegations of sexual misconduct by officers against civilians, such as lewd comments or gestures, snapping unwanted photographs or sexually humiliating or ticketing civilians if they rebuff flirtations like a blown kiss. The vote was unanimous, with three board members appointed by the police commissioner joining seven others appointed by the mayor or City Council.Later, it hopes to broaden that mandate and select a group of specially trained, senior investigators to handle the most serious allegations, including rape, though not before it builds up a budget and some expertise in helping survivors of traumatic sexual violence by officers.That next phase must be done carefully, to ensure that, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the procedures we put in place do not negatively impact the complainants and also don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t impact potential criminal investigations,‚<U+0080>ù Jonathan Darche, the executive director of the board, told board members at the meeting.In a memo outlining its rationale, the staff of the agency said there is little in the arena of abuse by sworn, armed law enforcement officers that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>undermines society‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confidence in the police more than an officer who wields the badge as a tool of sexual intimidation and coercion.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unfortunately,‚<U+0080>ù it went on, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the question is not whether such misconduct occurs. Rather, C.C.R.B. must investigate how often it occurs and what can be done to stop it.‚<U+0080>ùOutside watchdogs of the New York City police immediately embraced the idea as necessary and long overdue. The C.C.R.B. was formed in 1993 with a mandate by the City Charter to investigate four types of misconduct allegations: force; abuse of authority; discourtesy; and offensive language. It said in its memo that allegations of sexual misconduct by officers fall clearly under its power to look into cases of officers abusing their authority, though some cases might also involve discourtesy, offensive language or force.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s any surprise here, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s that the C.C.R.B. is only now getting to the point where it recognizes that sexual harassment by N.Y.P.D. officers is something the board has to be dealing with,‚<U+0080>ù Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the board before its vote, in Lower Manhattan. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I am glad you are confronting it now.‚<U+0080>ùFor allegations of criminal sexual conduct, the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo called for a new policy allowing the board to notify the appropriate district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a step beyond its current practice of only notifying the Internal Affairs Bureau ‚<U+0080><U+0094> though it said the high burden of proof in such cases means prosecutors often cannot or will not pursue them.Andrew Case, a lawyer who was a spokesman for the review board, said he worries ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that if these cases, particularly forcible assaults, fall to C.C.R.B., then that would be a sign that D.A.s are not doing all they can to investigate truly criminal acts.‚<U+0080>ùNew York state law does not explicitly forbid sexual contact between police officers and people in their custody, though it forbids such conduct by correction and parole officers. The New York State Assembly last week passed legislation to prevent police officers from escaping legal consequences of an alleged sexual assault by saying arrestees consented, and the State Senate is now considering the same measure. The New York City Council is also considering legislation that would make it a misdemeanor crime for police officers to have sexual contact with people in custody.The 117 allegations of sexual misconduct the board referred to the Internal Affairs Bureau between January 2016 and June ‚<U+0080><U+009C>included a variety of allegations, from catcalls and sexual propositions to unwanted touching and rape,‚<U+0080>ù the memo said. It summarized three of them to provide a range of cases the board receives.In one, a woman questioned by a Bronx detective in 2014, at a shooting scene, went on to repeatedly encounter the same man around the neighborhood ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and recalled that he would regularly lick his lips and make lewd expressions toward her,‚<U+0080>ù the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo said. In 2016, as she was held in a station house jail cell on a driving charge, the same detective entered her cell and made a profane gesture and a reference to oral sex.In another, a man alleged that an officer twice squeezed his genitals during a frisk last year that followed a street stop for jaywalking.The Police Department declined to answer questions about any discipline handed down to officers in the 117 complaints referred to its Internal Affairs Bureau, how the cases were decided or what the complaints alleged. It said it would work with the review board to implement the new procedure.For all review board referrals to the Internal Affairs Bureau, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a huge issue‚<U+0080>ù is that the police ‚<U+0080><U+009C>don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t tell us what happens with any of them,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Case said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One of the things this speaks to, a broader issue, is reporting from I.A.B. to C.C.R.B. about all referrals.‚<U+0080>ùWASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has argued for weeks that Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, should leave the race, said on Sunday that he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>going to let the people of Alabama make the call.‚<U+0080>ùAsked during an appearance on ABC News‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This Week‚<U+0080>ù whether he thought Mr. Moore, who has been accused of preying on teenage girls, should be in the Senate, Mr. Connell said the decision should be left to the Dec. 12 special election.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This election has been going on a long time,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There has been a lot of discussion about it. They are going to make the decision a week from Tuesday.‚<U+0080>ùIn the past, Mr. McConnell had said that he was looking at drafting a write-in candidate for the election, and that if Mr. Moore, a Republican, won the race, he would support a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the allegations against him.But on Sunday, Mr. McConnell seemed to accept that Mr. Moore, who has denied the allegations, would not be stepping down with only days remaining before the vote.Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Mr. McConnell, said the senator was not backing down from any earlier comments about Mr. Moore. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The leader did not change or retract any of his previous statements,‚<U+0080>ù she said in an email on Sunday.Mr. McConnell told ABC News that he still believed that the Ethics Committee should investigate the allegations against Mr. Moore.Several women have accused Mr. Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior. They said they had been subjected to groping, forcible kissing or other unwanted advances when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor in his 30s.Mr. McConnell noted on Sunday that two decades ago, when he was the chairman of the Ethics Committee, he had recommended the expulsion of Senator Bob Packwood, the powerful Oregon Republican, who resigned in 1995 after he was accused of sexual harassment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Senate has been very sensitive to these matters for a long time, and the Senate Ethics Committee will handle this in the regular order way that we do this in the Senate,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m confident they will come up with the right conclusion.‚<U+0080>ùA prominent donor to the Democratic Party says she is considering withdrawing support for senators who urged their colleague Al Franken to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct.The donor, Susie Tompkins Buell, has been one of the Democratic Party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most generous supporters for decades. In particular, she has been a champion of female politicians, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Maria Cantwell of Washington.Last month, those senators were among the dozens who called for Mr. Franken to resign from the Senate after at least six women accused him of sexual harassment or misconduct, such as forcible kissing and groping.Mr. Franken announced his resignation on Dec. 7 before the Senate Ethics Committee had completed a review of the accusations, which he disputed.Before he was elected to the Senate to represent Minnesota in 2008, Mr. Franken, a Democrat, was a well-known comedian and a cast member on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live.‚<U+0080>ù After he resigned, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith of Minnesota was named as his replacement.Ms. Buell said in a text message on Saturday that withdrawing support from the senators who called for his resignation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an option‚<U+0080>ù she was considering.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In my gut they moved too fast,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote, adding that Mr. Franken ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was never given his chance to tell his side of the story.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me this is dangerous and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a big believer in helping more women into the political system but this has given me an opportunity to rethink of how I can best help my party.‚<U+0080>ùShe is a friend of Hillary Clinton‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and has spoken in support of Ms. Gillibrand, who led the charge in the Senate to urge Mr. Franken to leave.In her text, Ms. Buell said she did not know Mr. Franken personally but had met him a couple of times and was impressed by his work as a senator.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As for Gillibrand, unfortunately, I believe she miscalculated and has shot herself in the foot,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have supported her for many years. Will I going forward? To be determined.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Buell, of San Francisco, was a founder of the clothing brand Esprit and has spent decades fund-raising and donating millions of dollars for liberal causes and candidates. Her Susie Tompkins Buell Foundation has awarded grants to organizations supporting climate change education, a free press and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights.In 2016, Ms. Buell contributed money to help a woman who had accused President Trump of harassment, she said, adding that the money was not used and was refunded. The New York Times reported last month that she was said to have donated $500,000 to support accusers, but Ms. Buell would not confirm the amount.Her comments about the senators who called for Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation were reported by BuzzFeed.A spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand did not respond directly to Ms. Buell but pointed to the senator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook post on Dec. 6, in which she urged Mr. Franken to resign.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have to rise to the occasion, and not shrink away from it, even when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard, especially when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is what this larger moment is about. So, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on Senator Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. Enough is enough. The women who have come forward are brave and I believe them.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Gillibrand added that the allegations against Mr. Franken were not equal to the harassment and assault accusations against the Hollywood filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, the Alabama politician Roy S. Moore and Mr. Trump. She has called for Mr. Trump to resign. In response, he wrote in a tweet that she was a lightweight ‚<U+0080><U+009C>who would come to my office ‚<U+0080><U+0098>begging‚<U+0080><U+0099> for campaign contributions not so long ago.‚<U+0080>ùThis past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Steven Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new movie, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Crown‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life with quick, grim strokes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ostensibly because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a suicide risk ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s who and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t belong in the hospital but doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help her case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Carrie‚<U+0080>ù) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Shining,‚<U+0080>ù another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich√©s and sadism and just read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crickets‚<U+0080>ù is slang for critics, but maybe the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.BOSTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A state senator's husband was indicted Thursday on charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos without consent and criminal lewdness.The indictment of Bryon Hefner, the husband of Democratic Sen. Stanley Rosenberg, came months after The Boston Globe reported on allegations that Hefner sexually harassed or abused several men, some of whom had business before the Legislature.Prosecutors said Hefner sexually assaulted three victims between 2014 and 2016. They said he also obtained nude and partially nude photos of another victim without that victim's knowledge and sent or showed the photos to other people.""Today's indictments on multiple felony charges send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,"" Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. ""I want to thank the victims who have come forward and put their trust in us.""Hefner's attorney said he ""intends to plead not guilty and looks forward to contesting the evidence and confronting the witnesses against him in a court of law.""Hefner is set to be arraigned on April 24 in Suffolk Superior Court, prosecutors said.Rosenberg, who is separated from Hefner, said these are ""serious charges.""""They are now being handled by the judicial system,"" he said in a statement. ""I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.""Rosenberg, who's in his late 60s, announced in January that he had separated from Hefner, who's 30, and that Hefner had entered treatment for alcohol dependency.Democratic state Senate President Harriette Chandler, who replaced Rosenberg as president, called the charges ""deeply disturbing.""""Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the District Attorney and Attorney General's Office,"" she said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, both Republicans, said they ""commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.""The initial reports that several men had accused Hefner of sexual assault or harassment sent the chamber into turmoil late last year, resulting in Rosenberg's decision to step down.The Senate Ethics Committee voted to hire a Boston law firm to independently investigate whether Rosenberg violated any Senate rules in connection with the allegations. That probe is ongoing.Rosenberg, a state senator since 1991, had initially hoped to return as president once the investigation was completed, but pressure mounted on senators to move on after the Globe subsequently reported that Hefner had involved himself in matters before the Senate. That included having access to Rosenberg's email account, despite Rosenberg's earlier promise to keep a ""firewall"" between his professional and personal lives.A lawyer for Hefner said at the time that Hefner ""did not have independent access to his husband's official email.""Rosenberg has repeatedly said that Hefner did not influence his actions and decisions as Senate president.Rosenberg assumed the top leadership post in January 2015. He was the first openly gay leader of either legislative chamber in Massachusetts.Democratic state Sen. Karen Spilka last week announced that she had secured commitments from enough of her colleagues to become the next Senate president, essentially ending any hope of Rosenberg's return as president. Rosenberg continues to serve as senator.When Chandler, who's 80, took over after Rosenberg's decision to step down, she said she intended to serve as president only through the remainder of this year.___Associated Press writers Bob Salsberg and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.OKLAHOMA CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed Wednesday that it is looking into a lawsuit's allegations that a middle school student was sexually assaulted and threatened by classmates over 18 months and that school officials did nothing to stop the attacks.The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Oklahoma City by the now 14-year-old boy and his parents, alleges that Superintendent A.J. Brewer and Principal Stuart McPherson of Washington Public Schools, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City treated the assaults as ""horseplay"" or ""accidental touching.""The OSBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations should be finished soon, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.""We should have our reports completed in a few weeks. We will then hand it over to the district attorney. The DA will then determine how to proceed,"" and whether criminal charges are warranted, Brown said.School attorney Andy Fugitt said Wednesday that he was aware of the lawsuit but that he could not comment on pending litigation.Under Oklahoma law, anyone who suspects a child under the age of 18 is being abused is required to report the suspicion to the state's Department of Human Services.According to the lawsuit, DHS was notified of the allegations in May 2017, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation began investigating in November at the request of the Washington Police Department.DHS spokeswoman Sheree Powell said the agency is prohibited by state and federal law from confirming any investigation.""We don't or confirm investigations involving particular allegations or individuals,"" Powell said.The lawsuit comes after four former football players in the Tulsa suburb of Bixby were previously charged with sexually assaulting a teammate that prosecutors said wasn't promptly reported.The four have pleaded not guilty and their attorneys have asked that the each be certified as juveniles.An Associated Press investigation published in 2017 examined sexual violence in school sports as part of a larger look at student-on-student sex assaults. The investigation found that team sexual assault is often mischaracterized as hazing and bullying and that the violence is so normalized that it persists for years, as players attacked one season become aggressors the next.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The British actress Minnie Driver, who recently resigned from her role as an Oxfam ambassador after revelations of sexual misconduct by staff members at the charity, said on Tuesday that the conversation around sexual assault should be based on a model similar to a truth and reconciliation commission to heal wounds and move forward.Ms. Driver, known for her roles in movies like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù was speaking at a London event focused on the #MeToo movement and organized by The New York Times and the How To Academy. Here are highlights of the interview.She spoke at length about comments made by Matt Damon, a former boyfriend, who said that alleged sexual misdeeds by powerful men involved a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>spectrum of behavior.‚<U+0080>ù Speaking on ABC News in December, Mr. Damon had said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be conflated.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver said that Mr. Damon ‚<U+0080><U+009C>represented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, she said men needed to be included in the conversation about sexual assault because ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no way to move forward unless we do this together.‚<U+0080>ù Use the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>model of truth and reconciliation,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to courtlike commissions set up after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda or apartheid in South Africa, where the judicial bodies were tasked with revealing wrongdoing in hopes of healing wounds.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Women get to be heard,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to metabolize that and then there is due process and then there is healing.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, the deputy chief executive of Oxfam resigned in the wake of accusations that the British charity had covered up misconduct by its staff members after revelations that aid workers had hired prostitutes in crisis zones in Chad and Haiti.Ms. Driver, who was affiliated with the organization for 20 years ‚<U+0080><U+0094> her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>longest relationship with anyone,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> announced last week that she was resigning from her role as a celebrity ambassador. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It broke my heart in so many ways,‚<U+0080>ù she said, particularly because she had been primarily involved in programs that were helping prostitutes in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam to retrain and rebuild their lives. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cut me to the very heart of what I had been involved with,‚<U+0080>ù she said.She added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I needed to send a very clear message, not to the beautiful people that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked with on the ground for so many years who are amazing and industrious, but to the corporation that knew, corporate people who knew this was going on. Who hush-hushed it. Who were not transparent about it, either with me or the people that worked for them, and who didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything about it.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver recounted her experience with Mr. Weinstein, the disgraced mogul who produced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù in which she plays an erudite Harvard graduate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cast me,‚<U+0080>ù she said, because he told her and the casting director that she was not attractive enough to have sex with. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got off lightly with him. I really did,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we talk about sexual harassment, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not about sex, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s about power.‚<U+0080>ùThe inhabitants of the derelict mansion in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lodgers‚<U+0080>ù don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get out much. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s script, the director Brian O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins‚<U+0080><U+0099> birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a measure of this movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insistently fright-free storytelling that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Edward. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dracula,‚<U+0080>ù as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers.Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chilling effect‚<U+0080>ù on campus sexual assault investigations.Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them.In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus.A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation.Under Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations.Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases.The Obama-era guidance, issued in 2011 and 2014, reinforced the obligation of colleges and universities to respond to sexual assault claims and was widely hailed as strengthening protections for accusers amid increasing evidence that those institutions were skirting their responsibilities to investigate sexual misconduct. But it was widely assailed by men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights and conservative civil liberties groups as heavily biased against the accused.In an extensive policy speech announcing the new guidance, Ms. DeVos outlined what she described as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>failed system‚<U+0080>ù that violated students‚<U+0080><U+0099> due process rights and lacked public confidence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. DeVos said in September. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.‚<U+0080>ùMs. DeVos issued interim guidance that raised the standard of proof for accusers to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>clear and convincing evidence‚<U+0080>ù from a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>preponderance of evidence‚<U+0080>ù and allowed cases to be settled in mediation sessions between the accuser and the accused. It also dropped time frames for completing investigations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new policy discriminates against women and girls and makes it harder for them to learn in a safe environment,‚<U+0080>ù said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center, which is representing the litigants in the suit.The plaintiffs in the suit, Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice and the Victim Rights Law Center, all advise or represent people who say they were sexually assaulted. The groups are being represented by Equal Rights Advocates, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Center for Youth Law and the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center.In the complaint, SurvJustice said that the group had not only seen ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a decrease in the number of sexual violence survivors seeking its services,‚<U+0080>ù but also observed a trend in educational institutions not responding at all, or not responding as promptly to its clients‚<U+0080><U+0099> complaints.The group also wrote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>students who have questioned whether they should continue with their plans to report sexual violence given the uncertainty regarding their legal protections and an anticipated lowered likelihood of success created by the policy change.‚<U+0080>ùThe Victims Rights Law Center, which focuses its efforts on rape and sexual assault, said Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s guidance was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating‚<U+0080>ù to its mission and operational activities.The groups are asking that the guidance be rescinded as unlawful.‚<U+0080><U+009C>With each day that passes, this discriminatory policy will continue to cause harm to survivors of sexual harassment and violence,‚<U+0080>ù said Alice Y. Abrokwa, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law.In their complaint, the groups wrote that Ms. DeVos and her acting leader of civil rights, Candice Jackson, made statements that revealed their bias against accusers.They cited Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy address during which she asserted that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>if everything is harassment, then nothing is,‚<U+0080>ù and Ms. Jackson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal of women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fake victims.‚<U+0080>ùSAN ANTONIO ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  In October of 2016, not long after a sexual assault scandal at Baylor swept out the football coach, athletic director and president of the university, the NCAA convened a commission to combat campus sexual violence.The commission crafted a policy focused on educating athletes and coaches and ensuring athletic departments were following school policies regarding the handling of sexual assault allegations. The commission's proposal was adopted by the NCAA board of governors last year .Since then, Michigan State has become embroiled in a horrific scandal involving a former athletic department doctor, Larry Nassar, who has been convicted of molesting dozens of women, including many Spartans athletes.NCAA leaders see the association as an agent of culture change, trying to curb a problem that goes beyond athletics. Others want the NCAA to take a more active role, putting rules in place that would ban individual offenders from competing in college athletics and sanction schools that fail to weed out potential predators. That is highly unlikely.""This is a systemic issue in society and certainly on campuses regardless of whether it's student-athletes or not,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday at the Alamodome, site of Saturday's Final Four. ""On that score, the NCAA and the Board of Governors in particular have been more engaged than any other higher education entity. In fact, we're providing leadership to the rest of higher ed right now on trying to figure out how to deal with these issues in advance and prevent them, rather than just always coming in after the fact and imposing some kind of punishment or solutions afterwards.""Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor and activist who speaks to college sports teams all over the country, is part of the NCAA's commission to combat campus sexual assault. Tracy was encouraged by the passing of the commission's recommendations by NCAA Board of Governors in August . But she is pushing for an NCAA ban on athletes who commit sexual violence.""I don't feel like anyone should be banned from their education,"" Tracy said. ""But I do think that playing sports is absolutely a privilege and not a right. It's a privilege to be an NCAA athlete. To be a scholarship athlete.""Tracy said because of the prestige that goes with being an athlete, especially in high-profile sports such as football and basketball, they have more influence on campus.""And so we have a duty and a responsibility to make sure we're driving conversations that effect attitudes and beliefs and how we view these issues correctly,"" she said. ""And we're not. We're basically saying if you can run fast enough and throw a ball and make enough money for a school or a sports program then you can do whatever you want. You can break a woman's face. You can stomp her. You can rape her. You can do whatever you want as long as you're a good enough athlete. And that's wrong.""And so I also talk to them about, you know, what about attaching eligibility to behavior. You attach it to grades. Why can't we say sexual assault is not OK. Domestic violence is not OK.""For the NCAA, stepping into the area of what it refers to as individual accountability is complicated territory.""You quickly recognize that there are other entities that hold individuals accountable for criminal acts per se or even for violations of Title IX on specific campuses when investigations are completed,"" NCAA chief legal officer Don Remy said. ""And so as we have looked at this we have looked at our role as composed of all of higher education. And how can we in college athletics be part of the higher education dialogue to change the culture. And how can we make sure that student-athletes are treated the same as students who are on campus who don't compete in athletics. Not to create any preferential treatment for student-athletes or to create a negative environment for student-athletes, but to have student-athletes be able to matriculate through their time on campus like other students who aren't competing in athletics.""Kathy Redmond, founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, said at the heart of the problem is athletes are often given preferential treatment and protection by athletic programs, boosters and even local enforcement when they are accused of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. Redmond called the sexual violence policy the NCAA passed last year a ""check-the-box"" measure.""But when it comes down to it, the individual players know that the system will work for them,"" she said.Redmond said the NCAA should use a proposal crafted by the Drake Group , a watchdog for college sports, to guide policy on sexual violence committed by athletes.Tracy would like the NCAA to adopt a policy similar to the one Indiana University implemented last year, which bans its teams from accepting any athletes with a documented history of sexual or domestic violence. IU's policy was inspired by a similar one implemented by the Southeastern Conference regarding transfers.Though Indiana athletic director Fred Glass said: ""We didn't implement it to be like a trailblazer or pulling people toward this policy.""Laws differ from state to state, down to definitions of sexual assault. A one-size fits all NCAA policy that bans athletes with past transgressions would be difficult to craft and possibly vulnerable to legal challenges.""What is that a life sentence?"" said Cleveland-based attorney Susan Stone, who represented Ma'Lik Richmond, the Youngstown State football player convicted of rape in juvenile court when he was in high school.Campus backlash prompted Youngstown State to ban Richmond from playing last season. He sued the school, which had no policy like Indiana's. The school settled and lifted the ban.""There needs to be some thought before you ostracize students,"" Stone said.Tracy said she is not just looking to punish wrongdoers.""We're not just failing survivors, but we're also failing these young men, too,"" she said. ""Especially with our athletes the way we place entitlement on them from a young age. The way we set them up for failure by protecting them from everything. All this stuff that we do with our athletes, we're not helping them.""___Follow Ralph D.

The once-beloved comedian and television star has been accused by more than 50 women of sexual assault going back decades.Only one of those accusations was recent enough to prosecute. Cosby, 80, is charged with drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, 44, at his home near Philadelphia between Dec. 30, 2003, and Jan. 20, 2004. Jury selection is due to start on Monday.Cosby, best known as the wise and witty dad in the 1980s TV hit ""The Cosby Show,"" has denied criminal wrongdoing, saying any sexual contact he had was consensual.Cosby's first trial ended in June with a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict following six days of deliberations.Cosby, who now walks with a cane and has poor vision, sat at the defense table on Thursday for the first of two days of pre-trial arguments, with the defense and prosecution clashing over what witnesses and evidence the jury should be allowed to see.Cosby's defense team sought the judge's recusal because his wife, Dr. Deborah O'Neill, is a psychotherapist at Penn who coordinates a group that helps sexual assault victims. She made a $100 donation to a feminist group at the University of Pennsylvania sponsoring the annual V-Day activities, which include a production of the play ""The Vagina Monologues.""O'Neill dismissed the request, saying, ""She's an independent woman and has a right to be involved in anything she believes in.""Prosecutors want to quash any mention of a 2005 press release in which former District Attorney Bruce Castor announced that he would not prosecute Cosby, and of how current District Attorney Kevin Steele later decided to file charges.Defense lawyers want the jury to hear from Margo Jackson, who they say will testify that she heard Constand say she could make money on a sexual assault accusation against a celebrity.In the first trial, O'Neill ruled Jackson's testimony was inadmissible as hearsay but now he is reconsidering.The pre-trial hearing was due to resume on Friday morning.Jury selection is to begin on Monday, with the jury pool being sequestered starting on Sunday night, O'Neill said.(Reporting by David DeKok Writing by Daniel Trotta Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Trott)A star University of Minnesota basketball player announced Thursday that he would not appeal a university ruling expelling him for sexual assault, effectively ending his college career.The university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action had found Reggie Lynch, 23, a senior, responsible for violating the university code over two incidents. In one case, the sentence was suspension; in the second, expulsion.Lynch played with the Gophers during investigations into the incidents, which dated back more than a year, but he was suspended from play last month when the first decision was made public.At a news conference on Thursday, Lynch insisted upon his innocence and blamed a national atmosphere that is unfair to those accused of sexual misdeeds for his downfall. In recent months, accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men have stirred new interest in combating such behavior.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, people will automatically assume that you are guilty if any accusations have been made,‚<U+0080>ù Lynch said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I feel scared that in today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, this is the world we live in today. I am angry that there is no real way to defend myself.‚<U+0080>ùA university spokesman confirmed Lynch was no longer an active student.Lynch was previously suspended from the team over the summer of 2016, after he was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a third woman. In that case, prosecutors did not charge him and a university investigation cleared him of responsibility.A center, Lynch was a standout for the Gophers last season, his junior year, winning the Big Ten‚<U+0080><U+0099>s defensive player of the year honors as Minnesota went 24-10 and made the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time under Coach Richard Pitino.This season, the Gophers are 14-14. Lynch had not played since Jan. 3.Lynch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Marlene, who appeared alongside her son and his lawyer on Thursday, specifically blamed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the current political climate at the U‚<U+0080>ù for what she characterized as an injustice done to her son.In late 2016, Minnesota football players threatened to boycott a bowl game to protest the suspensions of several teammates for their alleged involvement in a sexual assault. That brought national attention to the university, prompting the president, Eric W. Kaler, to vow a renewed initiative to combat sexual assault.Some sexual encounters are obviously consensual, while others are obviously not. But what about those that are neither black nor white? In the second episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars plunge deeper into the gray area.A woman who calls herself ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stuck in the Gray‚<U+0080>ù is still haunted by her first sexual encounter over a decade later. At age 22, she lost her virginity to her brother-in-law, who is 11 years her senior. The encounter had lasting repercussions on her sex life and her relationship with her family, especially her sister, her brother-in-law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife. Stuck in the Gray struggled to define the encounter for years and now she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unable to conclude if it was consensual. She asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I a coward and a liar who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hiding my accountability behind victimization?

He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an enemy of the state, a man of God and the great hero of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Power and the Glory.‚<U+0080>ù Father Frank Docherty, the protagonist of Thomas Keneally‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new novel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crimes of the Father,‚<U+0080>ù is a bad priest to some and a good one to others, and he certainly knows it. Sent away from his native Sydney in 1972 by an archbishop who found Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political activism and theological liberalism unacceptable, he is by the 1990s a psychologist and a professor in Canada. Under those auspices, he researches the sexual abuse of children and minors by the clergy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew the suspicion he attracted from his brethren in the wider priesthood. He was a priest who ponced around academia all week, dealing with unhealthy and distasteful subjects, and helped out at a local parish on the weekend ‚<U+0080><U+0094> how graceful of him!‚<U+0080>ùFor his 36th novel, Keneally has chosen a subject that is by now painfully familiar to both Roman Catholics and the wider public. The main action takes place in Sydney in 1996 and concerns the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding Irish population. This is a time and place and community in which those abused are just beginning to come forward more boldly, while church leaders and the faithful more broadly are themselves only just starting to reckon more openly with longstanding patterns of institutional failure, corruption and concealment. As he returns to Sydney to lecture on his research, resume complicated friendships and seek permission from the current archbishop to celebrate Mass again in his native archdiocese, Docherty becomes involved in an intertwined series of private and public revelations.For obvious reasons, Keneally admires his protagonist. As such, Docherty is not especially interesting, for he rarely seems genuinely unsure of himself. Whether he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preparing to confront an elite clergyman and his superior with evidence of the clergyman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse or trying to deal with once strong, now reheated feelings for a married woman, his struggles come across as stylized, even romantically heroic. You can be damned sure, mate, that tough-and-tender ol‚<U+0080><U+0099> Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to do the difficult thing, and do it well, no matter the odds.The novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far more distinctive and well-wrought character is Sarah Fagan, the Sydney cabdriver who picks up Docherty at the airport upon his return. Through intensely told flashback sequences, Keneally brings out the confusion and pain teenage Sarah experiences when she comes under the influence of Father Leo Shannon, a rising young star in the archdiocese. Under the guise of hiring her as his office assistant, Shannon makes Fagan feel privileged, even blessed, to spend secret time doing secret things with him. When he coolly rejects her for other girls, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she felt the jolt of this news, and a sickening bewilderment in the pit of her stomach; the extreme sentiments of the rejected.‚<U+0080>ùFrom this brilliant, brutal rendering of Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victimization, Keneally traces out her jagged trajectory through a convent childhood, university studies, a teaching career and assorted vocational and spiritual spinouts, and finally into her very tentative alliance with Docherty. This last happens to coincide with Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confrontation with Shannon himself, now a key adviser to the archbishop in legal proceedings concerning another abuse case. The heroism and villainy that play out thereafter is suspenseful, if predictable. Far more powerfully felt is Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unexpected expression of thanks to Docherty, near the novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end, for a favor he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done her, which has made possible both personal renewal and public justice. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What favor is that?‚<U+0080>ù the priest asks. Her answer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You believed me.‚<U+0080>ùJust one day after Hollywood offered a show of support for the #MeToo movement on the Golden Globes red carpet and stage, a famous actress on the other side of the Atlantic lent her name to a public letter denouncing the movement, as well as its French counterpart, #Balancetonporc, or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Expose Your Pig.‚<U+0080>ùCatherine Deneuve joined more than 100 other Frenchwomen in entertainment, publishing and academic fields Tuesday in the pages of the newspaper Le Monde and on its website in arguing that the two movements, in which women and men have used social media as a forum to describe sexual misconduct, have gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and have created a totalitarian climate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is a crime. But insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression,‚<U+0080>ù the letter, dated Monday, begins. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As a result of the Weinstein affair, there has been a legitimate realization of the sexual violence women experience, particularly in the workplace, where some men abuse their power. It was necessary. But now this liberation of speech has been turned on its head.‚<U+0080>ùThey contend that the #MeToo movement has led to a campaign of public accusations that have placed undeserving people in the same category as sex offenders without giving them a chance to defend themselves. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This expedited justice already has its victims, men prevented from practicing their profession as punishment, forced to resign, etc., while the only thing they did wrong was touching a knee, trying to steal a kiss, or speaking about ‚<U+0080><U+0098>intimate‚<U+0080><U+0099> things at a work dinner, or sending messages with sexual connotations to a woman whose feelings were not mutual,‚<U+0080>ù they write. The letter, written in French was translated here by The New York Times.The passage appears to refer to the some of the names on a growing list of men who have been suspended, fired or forced to resign after having been accused of sexual misconduct in the last several months.One of the arguments the writers make is that instead of empowering women, the #MeToo and #BalanceTonPorc movements instead serve the interests of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the enemies of sexual freedom, of religious extremists, of the worst reactionaries,‚<U+0080>ù and of those who believe that women are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0098>separate‚<U+0080><U+0099> beings, children with the appearance of adults, demanding to be protected.‚<U+0080>ù They write that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman can, in the same day, lead a professional team and enjoy being the sexual object of a man, without being a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>promiscuous woman,‚<U+0080><U+0099> nor a vile accomplice of patriarchy.‚<U+0080>ùThey believe that the scope of the two movements represses sexual expression and freedom. After describing requests from publishers to make male characters ‚<U+0080><U+009C>less sexist‚<U+0080>ù and a Swedish bill that will require people to give explicit consent before engaging in sexual activity, the women write, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One more effort and two adults who will want to sleep together will first check, through an app on their phone, a document in which the practices they accept and those they refuse will be duly listed.‚<U+0080>ùThey continue, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The philosopher Ruwen Ogien defended the freedom to offend as essential to artistic creation. In the same way, we defend a freedom to bother, indispensable to sexual freedom.‚<U+0080>ù Though the writers do not draw clear lines between what constitutes sexual misconduct and what does not, they say that they are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sufficiently farseeing not to confuse a clumsy come-on and sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ùTranslations of the letter were quickly picked up by Twitter on Tuesday, and responses ranged from supportive to hostile. Asia Argento, an actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the Frenchwomen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter on Twitter.On the other side of the spectrum, Christina Hoff Sommers, who coined the term ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victim feminism,‚<U+0080>ù tweeted a quote from the letter and her remarks on it.In France, tens of thousands of stories have landed on social media under the hashtag #Balancetonporc since the journalist Sandra Muller used it in October in a post on Twitter about an inappropriate come-on she received from a French executive.The multitude of revelations in France has led to discussion of legislative proposals that would fine men for aggressive catcalling or lecherous behavior toward women in public, and lengthen the statute of limitations for cases involving minors. Marl√®ne Schiappa, France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s junior minister for gender equality, said that France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parliament would also debate whether to establish a clear age below which a minor cannot consent to a sexual relationship. The decision came after French prosecutors declined to charge a 28-year-old man with rape after he had sex with an 11-year-old girl.In March, Ms. Deneuve defended Roman Polanski, the director who pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl and who was accused by two other women of forcing himself on them when they were under age. While appearing on a French television channel, Ms. Deneuve said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been dealt with, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been judged. There have been agreements between Roman Polanski and this woman.‚<U+0080>ùIn concluding the letter, the writers return to the concept of self-victimization and a call for women to accept the pitfalls that come with freedom. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Accidents that can affect a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s body do not necessarily affect her dignity and must not, as hard as they can be, necessarily make her a perpetual victim,‚<U+0080>ù they write. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Because we are not reducible to our bodies. Our inner freedom is inviolable. And this freedom that we cherish is not without risks and responsibilities.‚<U+0080>ùIf you were dream-casting the role of Golden Globes host for the season of #MeToo and #TimesUp, with black-clad attendees from TV series and films that confronted misogyny (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Handmaid‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Tale‚<U+0080>ù) and racism (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Get Out‚<U+0080>ù) and a barnburner of a speech by a black female icon, you might not have picked the straight white guy.Nor, apparently, would the straight white guy. From his opening line, Seth Meyers hung a light on the dissonance of a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s being the master of this ceremony: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.‚<U+0080>ù Hosts of future awards shows, he said, were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>watching me tonight like the first dog they shot into outer space.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers borrowed a bit from his late-night talk show, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jokes Seth Can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t Tell,‚<U+0080>ù in which Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel deliver comedy that would sound strange coming from him. Here, he set up a gag for stars including Jessica Chastain (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Golden Globes turned 75 this year ‚<U+0080>¶ ‚<U+0080>ù), who sold the punch line (‚<U+0080><U+009C> ‚<U+0080>¶ but the actress that plays its wife is still only 32‚<U+0080>ù).Irony is Mr. Meyers‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thing, and he was deftly funny pointing it out. But the fact remains that the change in the air at the Globes is a recent and hardly complete process.On the one hand, the speeches from the podium were often sharply conscious ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not just the acceptances. Natalie Portman, presenting the best director award for film, announced, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Here are the all-male nominees.‚<U+0080>ùAnd Oprah Winfrey, accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, took the audience to church with a fervent, personal speech dedicated to abused women inside and outside Hollywood. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But their time is up.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers wisecracked in his monologue about the notion that Ms. Winfrey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has played down her political ambitions before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might run for president. By the end of her speech, it sounded a tiny bit less like a joke.Still, for all the consensus from the stage, the Globes still celebrated the power players of a system in which Harvey Weinstein, whose abuses precipitated the current moment, was active just a year ago. And at the awards, by and large, the men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> half of any gender dynamic in Hollywood or elsewhere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> let their ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up‚<U+0080>ù pins do the talking.Awards celebration has mingled with dissent before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like at last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Globes, just before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. (He still took a few digs this year.)It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something else for the usually frothy Globes to be held at a moment when the industry, or at least a portion of it, is dissenting against itself.The unsteady balance was apparent from the first footsteps on the red carpet. There were fewer questions about who the stars were wearing, and more about why. (Again, the women fielded a lot more of those questions than the men.)But there was dissonance, too, in an awards-media system not usually equipped to handle matters weightier than a champagne bubble. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Let me just tell you, our coverage is woke!‚<U+0080>ù said the E! correspondent Justin Sylvester, by way of introducing the 360-degree camera at the celebrity arrival area.When woke met woke, it was sometimes a rude awakening. On the E! red-carpet special, Debra Messing called out the network for its treatment of its former news host Catt Sadler, who said she left E! because of a gender pay gap. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Messing said.For much of the night, though, it was a surprisingly ordinary Golden Globes. It wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t quite a celebration; it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely a protest. (Even the black color scheme ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a visual statement for the women, less so for the ordinarily tux-clad men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> conveyed the feeling of a half-demonstration.) The Golden Globes always pitches itself as a televised party, but what kind?Maybe, as the color scheme suggested, the awards were meant to be a wake for a system of victimization. But it will be a good number of awards cycles, after the black outfits are put away, before we know if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite dead.Utah‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief law enforcement officer was deep in the fight against opioids when he realized that a lack of data on internet sales of fentanyl was hindering investigations. So the officer, Keith D. Squires, the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public safety commissioner, created a team of analysts to track and chronicle online distribution patterns of the drug.In Philadelphia, hidebound ways of confronting iPhone thefts let thrive illicit networks to distribute stolen cellphones. Detectives treated each robbery as an unrelated street crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>apple picking‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> rather than a vast scheme with connected channels used by thieves to sell the stolen phones.And in Nashville, investigators had no meaningful statistics on a nasty new swindle of the digital age: the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheating husband‚<U+0080>ù email scheme. In it, anonymous extortionists mass-email large numbers of men, threatening to unmask their infidelities. The extortionists have no idea if the men have done anything wrong, but enough of them are guilty, it turns out, that some pay up, sometimes with Bitcoin.Each case demonstrates how the tools used to fight crime and measure crime trends in the United States are outdated. Even as certain kinds of crimes are declining, others are increasing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> yet because so many occur online and have no geographic borders, local police departments face new challenges not only fighting them, but also keeping track of them. Politicians often promote crime declines without acknowledging the rise of new cybercrimes.Detectives only learned of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheating husband‚<U+0080>ù scheme from faithful spouses who were not victims. The crime did not fit into any existing category, and since the police had made no arrests, they had no statistics to feed to a national crime database in Washington that can prepare other jurisdictions for the scheme.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Suspects take advantage, knowing that ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Hey, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m basically committing crimes blindly,‚<U+0080><U+0099> without the fear of prosecution,‚<U+0080>ù said Capt. Jason M. Reinbold, commander of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigations division. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t analyze something if I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have data.‚<U+0080>ùMany of the offenses are not even counted when major crimes around the nation are tallied. Among them: identity theft; sexual exploitation; ransomware attacks; fentanyl purchases over the dark web; human trafficking for sex or labor; revenge porn; credit card fraud; child exploitation; and gift or credit card schemes that gangs use to raise cash for their traditional operations or vendettas.In a sense, technology has created an extraordinary moment for industrious criminals, increasing profits without the risk of street violence. Digital villainy can be launched from faraway states, or countries, eliminating physical threats the police traditionally confront. Cyberperpetrators remain unknown. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, ask themselves: Who owns their crimes? Who must investigate them? What are the specific violations? Who are the victims? How can we prevent it?‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s incredibly challenging,‚<U+0080>ù the police chief in Tucson, Chris Magnus, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a lack of clarity.‚<U+0080>ùThe rise of the crimes flies in the face of the proclamations of politicians who declare crime an all but defeated societal ill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to go back to the 1950s to see crime this low,‚<U+0080>ù Bill de Blasio, New York City‚<U+0080><U+0099>s second-term Democratic mayor, said recently on MSNBC‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Morning Joe.‚<U+0080>ù His comments reflected last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s historically low numbers of murders and shootings, burglaries, robberies and auto thefts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> offenses measured by the police CompStat tracking program.But to many criminologists, academics and law enforcement leaders, crimes like car theft are anachronisms in a modern era in which the internet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s virtual superhighways have supplanted brick-and-mortar streets as the scenes for muggings, prostitution rings or commercial burglaries. They see dips in traditional violence and larceny as offset by a twin phenomenon: A surge in the evolving crimes of the digital era, and the fact that they are not fully captured in law enforcement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reporting systems.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the old iceberg metaphor,‚<U+0080>ù said Nola Joyce, a former deputy commissioner of Philadelphia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s police department. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we know about is above the surface. But in terms of value, and in terms of harm, a lot of that crime is below the surface.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an old saying that came out of the Vietnam War,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that said, `If you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t measure what matters, what you measure matters a great deal.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Joyce is working with others on a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, to modernize local and federal crime-classification systems.New solutions are a priority, too, for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and progressive police commanders. They say that without timely, accurate data on crime, criminal justice leaders cannot see and respond coherently to national trends or make informed policy and spending decisions or tailor deployment strategies to best battle them.As Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group that has studied the issue, put it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem is, to use an overused expression, `You don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099> and by that I mean we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know the extent of these incidents in our communities or from a national perspective.‚<U+0080>ùIndeed, an Internet Crime Complaint Center established by the F.B.I. in 2000, to capture internet crime, received 298,728 complaints in 2016, reflecting $1.3 billion in combined losses, according to a new report by Mr. Wexler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group. But Donna Gregory, the head of the center, said that number of complaints only represented about 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims in the United States in 2016, and a fraction of all victims worldwide. In fact, a single category of internet crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> identify theft ‚<U+0080><U+0094> generated $15.4 billion in losses in 2014, according to a crime victimization survey by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.In its report, Mr. Wexler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group said its findings represented a wake-up call for the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 18,000 policing agencies facing an increase in technology-based crimes, that sprawl across jurisdictions, and recommended they fight back with similar tools by: developing their own digital expertise; hiring civilian analysts; mining technology, to help solve crime; encouraging banks to forward reports of theft rather write off their losses.Above all, policing needs ‚<U+0080><U+009C>better systems for gathering data,‚<U+0080>ù the report said.It is an issue that dates back to 1929, when the F.B.I. first rolled out its Uniform Crime Reporting system that still stands today. Designed as a summary count, it mainly tracks a handful of so-called Part One index crimes: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, arson and auto theft. The counts include only the top charge in a given episode.In the 1980s, the F.B.I., with Bureau of Justice Statistics, tried to improve the reporting by building the so-called National Incident-Based Reporting System to capture deeper levels of data across more categories. It created, for instance, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>crimes against a person‚<U+0080>ù which includes: assault, murder, kidnapping, abduction and sexual offenses. Each act is counted separately, within an incident or a crime that encompasses several criminal elements.But 40 years later, data collection is still haphazard as policing agencies that protect just 31 percent of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s population volunteer to abide by the deeper reporting standards. (An example: There is no national database of police officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> use of deadly physical force.) Still, the F.B.I. is charging forward, vowing to move fully to its 1980s-era vision by 2021. Only last year did it began collecting data on two new offenses in its fraud category: hacking/computer invasion and identify theft.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crime data reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in its current state ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is not collecting the right information to understand and analyze current events,‚<U+0080>ù Stephen G. Fischer Jr., an F.B.I. spokesman, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s information age has changed how we see the world and what the world expects from policing.‚<U+0080>ùThe panel of the National Academy of Sciences is looking past the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unmet goals ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which it sees as one component of a new approach. The panel wants a fresh system for understanding the nature and extent of crime today, said Janet L. Lauritsen, the panel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chair and a criminology professor at the University of Missouri.It envisions a format modeled in part, on an international framework organized by the United Nations that would reflect 11 prime categories of crime and 189 sublevels, including many that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>are just not even part of the national conversation on crime,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lauritsen said. It would, for instance, capture reports from federal agencies, she said, that have never reported crime data to the F.B.I., ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even though there is actually a law on the books,‚<U+0080>ù the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act, from 1988, that compels it.Better data fosters transparency, which can build trust with civilians even if it yields statistical crime increases, said Col. Edwin C. Roessler Jr., the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., who is the F.B.I. director‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chairman for converting policing to a new crime classification system. Data offers the evidence to lobby government for more money or better laws, he said. In fact, when Colonel Roessler demonstrated how each gang homicide, on average, required 25 search warrants for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberdata, cellphones and other social media,‚<U+0080>ù it helped win financing for a new Cyber Bureau and new ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberexperts‚<U+0080>ù to work gang cases and build meaningful statistics and intelligence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got gaps here, where we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not catching the root causes of all kinds of criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù the colonel said, a flaw with real-life consequences.So too, for Chief Magnus, in Tucson, who sees the lack of modern-day crime classification as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one of our biggest frustrations.‚<U+0080>ù As he leads a force of 850 officers patrolling 300 square miles, lapses in accurate statistics on property crime, fraud, human trafficking and digital crime hurt his ability to deploy thin resources.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once you get into cyberspace,‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>data about anything is so limited that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really, really hard to figure out even what might be happening locally that impacts that crime.‚<U+0080>ùWhen the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed in 1993, Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bloody troubles did not die with him. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here,‚<U+0080>ù Maria McFarland S√°nchez-Moreno, who spent years as a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch, writes about the harrowing violence carried out by paramilitary groups that bloomed in the country in the late 1990s. She focuses on the stories of three men who have tried to help solve the problem against enormous odds: the human rights activist Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Valle, who was murdered for what he exposed; the prosecutor Iv√°n Vel√°squez; and the journalist Ricardo Calder√≥n. The book covers their dangerous efforts, the links between the paramilitaries and Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political establishment, and the influence of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and its war on drugs. Ms. McFarland, now the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, discusses below the bravery of her subjects, the inspiration she takes from photojournalists who work in conflict areas and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It started when I had finished up being a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch. I had spent six years documenting atrocities and trying to get the government to address them. But I was frustrated, because all those documents I had been producing didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really capture the reality I had gotten to know so well, the stories of these extraordinary people, who despite horrendous conditions often insisted on fighting for truth, for justice; insisted on being incredibly honest even though they could have easily gone in another direction and all the pressures were in that direction. In the United States, anyone who knew anything about Colombia knew about Pablo Escobar and the FARC, but very few people knew about the paramilitaries, and stories usually depicted the heroes as D.E.A. agents or law enforcement. They were missing this whole piece, these ordinary people who make tremendous sacrifices, take huge risks and often get killed because they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re standing on principle.I started out with the idea of just doing an article in 2012. I was very focused on the story of Iv√°n Vel√°squez, who had followed the links between congress and these paramilitary death squads. He had worked very much alone with not much support, and faced an elaborate campaign by high-level government officials and those in the intelligence service to discredit him. As I talked to him, I realized it was part of a much larger story. He was personally connected to the other two characters in the book. I started drafting a book proposal, which took four years to write. The book took two.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I knew that people were brave. But once I started asking them for their stories in details, I was surprised by just how many risks they took. And when I spoke to their family members, they received threats and had themselves been wrapped up in this and terribly impacted. Yet they had never tried to get them to stop doing their work. In fact, Mar√≠a Victoria, Iv√°n‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, kept some very serious threats made against her secret because she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want him to give up what he was doing. She knew it would break him because it was such an important part of who he was, to follow through on his commitment.With Calder√≥n, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize the sort of risks he had taken. I knew him as a journalist, and I knew he had exposed these scandals and efforts to smear Vel√°squez. I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize just how intrepid he was because he was just so humble. Years later, I found out he had actually been abducted by his sources in the intelligence service at one point. They thought he was going to betray them and they needed to know if he was being straight with them. They gave him this drug to tell the truth and he lost consciousness overnight. He just kept going with his work; met with them the next day and they apologized.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I started out with a very important story about one man who led these investigations and was attacked and then prevailed. It turned into a much richer story when I brought in these other characters and dug into the history. Once I had a broader scope and more characters, I could trace the arc of how the paramilitaries grew and what they were, and how they were able to gain so much power and influence and develop all these connections, in a way I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have been able to do if the book had been about one set of investigations.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Photojournalists, in general, who have worked in some of these conflicts. One of them is Stephen Ferry, with whom I worked very closely in Colombia. He captured the humanity and all sorts of nuances of the reality of Colombia in ways that aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t usually presented in journalism and in the policy world. Seeing someone who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to capture those deeper aspects of reality made me also want to do that.Another piece that made an impression on me while I was writing the book was Joshua Oppenheimer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Look of Silence,‚<U+0080>ù a sequel to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Act of Killing.‚<U+0080>ù He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to show what it means for people to live with a legacy of mass atrocity while the perpetrators are still in power, and in a way that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what was happening in Colombia while I was there.Persuade someone to read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here‚<U+0080>ù in 50 words or less.It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a fast-paced true story, something of a thriller. It introduces you to brutality and corruption in a country at the center of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> war on drugs. It also offers hope that brave, committed people who care about what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right can make a difference.This interview has been condensed and edited.Your book ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Doomsday Machine‚<U+0080>ù is a warning, based on your experience at the highest levels of nuclear planning at RAND in the early 1960s, that an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust killing nearly every human alive could happen much more easily than most people realize ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which is a pretty urgent message. Why did it take you nearly 60 years to write about it? It didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I submitted the first third of the book to a publisher in 1975, as soon as the war ended. Her response was we would only sell 1,400 copies of this book. So I thought, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All right, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s enough for every member of Congress and a lot of media people and academics.‚<U+0080>ù And she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No, that means we wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t publish it.‚<U+0080>ù And that was reiterated a number of times in succeeding years.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re warning people that human civilization itself is at risk, and so many people don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be concerned. Does it ever make you feel as if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re the crazy one? No, it makes me feel that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m living in a country in a very intense state of denial. I was saying to my wife the other day, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You know, if I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know any more than the public knows about the nuclear danger, I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be worried about it either.‚<U+0080>ùIf an accidental nuclear war does happen, will you have the willpower not to tell everyone ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I told you so?‚<U+0080>ù Well, how much time would I have? In San Francisco I would expect to be within the range of immediate effects.You were 30 years old when you wrote America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nuclear-war plans for the defense secretary, Robert McNamara. Is that too much responsibility for someone that young? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too much responsibility for an 86-year-old or a 70-year-old. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever had a human leader in any state that could really live up to that responsibility.How does it feel to write a plan that would kill tens of millions of people? I was in denial. I was part of a plan that should never have been made that was a crime against humanity. I once came to a disarmament press conference at the U.N., and Time had just had a picture on their cover of a terrorist, and I showed this picture from Time, and I said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I want to see a nuclear terrorist, I just have to look in the mirror.‚<U+0080>ù Now if you say, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do I feel about that?‚<U+0080>ù Well, I feel terrible.How surprised are you that there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a nuclear apocalypse yet? I am surprised. On the whole, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been incredibly lucky. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something like a miracle, but miracles, I guess, do happen. Could we survive another 70 or 100 years without nuclear winter? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unlikely, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not impossible. But no matter how small the likelihood is, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m working to try to double it.Do you think President Trump is utilizing the madman theory with North Korea, purposely making them think he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unstable, or is he just a madman? Oh, sure, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very explicit about it. He says he cannot reject first use of nuclear weapons, because you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to keep it on the table. Well, that worried people, because he looks crazy, so people thought, Gee, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not just using the theory here, he is unfortunately making a very credible threat. But since the mid-‚<U+0080><U+0099>60s the idea of initiating nuclear war by the U.S. has been nothing other than a madman theory. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been insane to think of doing that.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re most famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers, which are the subject of the movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Post.‚<U+0080>ù What do you think of how you were portrayed? Very, very well, because I was portrayed by a terrific actor who looks a lot as I did at the time, only better.The charges against you were thrown out after it was discovered that Richard Nixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>plumbers‚<U+0080>ù broke into your psychoanalyst‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office looking for dirt on you. Does it ever amaze you that after carrying out the biggest leak of government secrets in American history, you pretty much got off scot-free? It was a miracle. As I say, secular miracles do happen.ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain By Abby Norman 272 pp. Nation Books. $27.In the 1940s, in their quest to devise an objective pain scale, Cornell University researchers poked an increasingly hot metal rod into the hands of 13 women in the throes of childbirth. The volunteers were supposed to express how each level of heat compared with the others. But as labor progressed and the rod got hotter, they were in too much distress (and quite possibly distracted with other kinds of pain) to grapple with adjectives. Throbbing? Searing? A 7 on a scale of 10?And therein lies the conundrum. Few of us can express our aches and hurts accurately, particularly when we are in the thick of them.This quirky bit of medical history opens Abby Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vivid memoir, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus.‚<U+0080>ù But the focus of the book is really in the subtitle: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain.‚<U+0080>ù She builds a convincing case that women describing discomfort are more likely than men to be dismissed by physicians, but along the way tells a story that will resonate with anyone (man or woman) who has ever experienced pain.Norman suffers from endometriosis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a chronic and debilitating illness triggered by uterine-like cells growing outside of the womb. Women with the disorder have heavy, agonizing periods along with a litany of other symptoms depending on where the rogue cells lurk. If they congregate near the bladder, urinating hurts; near the sciatic nerve, pain can shoot down the legs; inside the lung (a rare event), breathing can be stifled.After one bout ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>as sudden as a thunderclap. A stabbing pain in my middle‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Norman eventually got to an emergency room, where she was handed the typical 1-10 pain scorecard. She was still aching, but not in the original horrors of it all. So she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how to assign a number to it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Bad enough that I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ignore it, which made it definitely higher than a four or five.‚<U+0080>ù She questioned whether she was a six or higher and whether the doctor would believe her anyhow.Norman repeatedly told doctors that sexual intercourse ached ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like a dull pinch, that resonated to my pelvis.‚<U+0080>ù No one paid attention until her boyfriend accompanied her and mentioned his frustration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Becoming a disappointment to a man,‚<U+0080>ù she writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>seemed to do the trick.‚<U+0080>ùNorman is a terrific storyteller with a gift for weaving memorable anecdotes, some drawn from medical history, others from recent scientific debates and most plucked from her own travails. We learn about Sigmund Freud and his views of his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hysterical‚<U+0080>ù female clients. We read about baby monkeys who grew up with emotional issues because their real cuddly moms were removed at birth and replaced with pretend wire-doll monkey-mothers. We learn of recent ideas challenging long-held notions about the origins of endometriosis. Many experts no longer believe the disease is triggered by uterine cells that escaped the womb, but rather by uterine-like cells that originated outside of it.Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life is much more than a disease. She emancipated herself from her family at the age of 16 and sought solace in books, particularly scientific literature, to understand her symptoms. Many doctors chalked up her distress to physical expressions of a psychic trauma.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus‚<U+0080>ù is an important addition to a long tradition of pain memoirs. Norman shares a particular tale of suffering but expresses a common frustration about the dearth of words to convey pain. Any schoolgirl can talk about love, Virginia Woolf famously said, but ‚<U+0080><U+009C>let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.‚<U+0080>ùJERUSALEM ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Polish and Israeli officials met on Thursday to address the diplomatic rift that erupted over a new Polish law that makes it a crime to blame Poland for the Holocaust, a measure that Israeli officials have likened to Holocaust denial.The law, adopted last month over the furious objections of Israel and scholars from around the world, makes it a crime to blame ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Polish nation‚<U+0080>ù for the Holocaust and other World War II atrocities carried out by the Nazis during their occupation from 1939 to 1945.It was the Nazis who oversaw the exterminations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by means of mass shootings, gas chambers, starvation and slave labor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that claimed the lives of some six million Jews. But the role of Polish collaborators, participants and enablers in the Nazi-run system of mechanized death remains a subject of fraught historical inquiry.Poland‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right-wing government says its goal is to defend the nation from slander, but scholars say the result is to stifle inquiry and reconciliation.Last week, a group of Poles who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II added their voices to the debate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We ask you not to rewrite history,‚<U+0080>ù the Poles ‚<U+0080><U+0094> among 6,850 Poles recognized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>righteous among the nations‚<U+0080>ù for their heroism ‚<U+0080><U+0094> wrote in an open letter to both Polish and Israeli leaders.One of those who signed the letter was Anna Stupnicka-Bando, 89, who was a teenager when she and her mother smuggled books and food into the Warsaw ghetto. It was during one of those illegal trips that they met an 11-year-old Jewish girl, Liliana Adler, whom they hid in their two-bedroom apartment at her father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s urging.Posing as Anna‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cousin, Liliana lived with the family ‚<U+0080><U+0094> under their neighbors‚<U+0080><U+0099> suspicious gazes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for four years until they were liberated by the Soviet Army in 1945.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everyone knows that there were those who were good and those who were bad,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said in a phone interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those who were saving Jews, and those who were robbing and murdering them. There were heroes just as there were thieves and killers. Just like there were in every other nation. To say different is harmful and nonsensical.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is it now with all this counting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> this checking how many of us were good and how many were bad? We are not some potatoes planted in a field that can be counted. We are people. Let it go.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Stupnicka-Bando said the new dispute was unnecessary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In recent years, we had finally managed to get some peace and quiet,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like all those conflicts and tensions were gone. How can they be back? How can one unfortunate phrase, one inaccurately written sentence destroy all of it?‚<U+0080>ùOn Thursday, Israeli and Polish diplomats met for more than three hours in what the Israeli Foreign Ministry described as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>candid and open dialogue,‚<U+0080>ù although the talks were inconclusive.The Israeli side was represented by Yuval Rotem, the ministry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director general, and included diplomats, legal experts and historians from Yad Vashem.At the start of the talks, Mr. Rotem told the Polish team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> led by the deputy foreign minister, Bartosz Cichocki ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no secret‚<U+0080>ù that the legislation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a matter of concern to Israel and to the Jewish people worldwide.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We must make sure that historical truths are preserved, that there be no restrictions on the freedom of research and speech, and that the wide threat of criminalization in this regard is addressed and resolved.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the closed-door talks, the ministry said it was especially concerned about ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the criminalization clause, which constitutes an obstacle to the study of the truth and to open historical debate.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also expressed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>concern about the public atmosphere that had recently been created in Poland and manifestations of anti-Semitism, and stressed the need for the Polish government to act with zero tolerance in the face of anti-Semitism.‚<U+0080>ùThe dispute has strained relations between Israel and Poland. At a security conference last month in Munich, Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confronted his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki.During a discussion, Ronen Bergman, a journalist who covers intelligence affairs for Yediot Ahronot and writes for The New York Times Magazine,  remarked that his parents, who were born in Poland, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lost much of their families because their Polish neighbors snitched to the Gestapo.‚<U+0080>ùHe added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After the war my mother swore she would never speak Polish for the rest of her life, not even a single word.‚<U+0080>ùIn a rambling response, Mr. Morawiecki said it would remain legal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian, not only German perpetrators.‚<U+0080>ùThe reference to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jewish perpetrators‚<U+0080>ù infuriated Israelis and others. Mr. Netanyahu called the comments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>outrageous‚<U+0080>ù and added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people.‚<U+0080>ùEven so, Mr. Netanyahu has resisted pressure from legislators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including some from within his governing coalition ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to recall Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ambassador to Poland.In an opinion article in Haaretz on Thursday, the deputy prime minister of Poland, Jaroslaw Gowin, said that Israeli-Polish cooperation had improved in recent years and urged further dialogue.How the law will be enforced remains to be seen. Historians, journalists and artists are to be exempted from prosecution under the law, and Joanna Kopcinska, a government spokeswoman, said that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>witnesses of history‚<U+0080>ù would also be exempt.The Polish government, which has also curbed judicial independence and the press, is feuding with the European Union over the state of the rule of law in Poland.On Thursday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the European Commission, the bloc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executive body, which has threatened to strip Poland of voting rights because of threats to democratic norms.The commission warned Poland this week that it had until March 20 to backtrack on its judicial changes before Brussels takes action. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The clock is ticking,‚<U+0080>ù Michael Roth, Germany‚<U+0080><U+0099>s minister for European Union affairs, told journalists.The tensions on both fronts might have given the governing Law and Justice party pause. This week, the speaker of Parliament delayed debate on a proposal to establish a day of memorial honoring Poles who saved Jews.Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said she hoped the current tensions were a result of a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misunderstanding and not ill will.‚<U+0080>ù She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We, the righteous ones, are optimists.‚<U+0080>ùEwa Junczyk-Ziomecka, the president of the Jan Karski Educational Foundation, which organized the open letter, noted that many of the letter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s signers were in their 90s, and she worried that memories of righteous acts were fading.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried that their legacy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the mutual understanding between Poles and Jews they achieved ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might now be lost,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said.She added that it would be important to study the experiences of both groups ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Jews inside the ghetto walls, non-Jewish Poles in their occupied country.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jews and Poles spent years learning about what is a source of pain for the Jews, and what it is in the Polish soul that hurts,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Their memories complete each other. They can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t imagine that someone might break them apart.‚<U+0080>ùA level-headed documentary lies behind the hot-blooded title of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy: Death, Denial & Depiction.‚<U+0080>ù While there may be no completely dispassionate way to discuss its topic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Armenian genocide ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s balance of emotion and composure helps make its stories even stronger.Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in the early part of the 20th century. What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.Joe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Promise,‚<U+0080>ù a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plan is smart as well as symbolic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.At its core, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy‚<U+0080>ù is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,‚<U+0080>ù one scholar says near the end of the documentary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>History is not in the past.‚<U+0080>ùOn most days, Facebook doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much in common with President Trump. But at the moment, both are in the damage-control business, as they try to get out from under the cloud of suspicion related to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meddling in the 2016 election.Their goals collided in awkward fashion over the weekend when Rob Goldman, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of advertising, posted a series of messages on Twitter that were meant to clear up misconceptions about Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s role in the election. Instead, he plunged the company deeper into controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Goldman tweeted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman was tweeting only for himself, but his comments, which drew praise from other Facebook executives on Twitter, were an unusually candid statement that flouted Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s well-sculpted messaging strategy, which has generally been to stay as far away from partisan debates as possible. The tweets arrived soon after the blockbuster indictment of Russian nationals by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and they were noticed by right-wing partisans, who saw them as supporting evidence for Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no collusion‚<U+0080>ù claims. Soon, Mr. Trump himself had retweeted them approvingly.Mr. Goldman eventually walked back some of his statements, but it was too late. Mr. Goldman had just given Mr. Trump something that looked like a Facebook-stamped exoneration.Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t mean to bolster the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s position.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,‚<U+0080>ù Joel Kaplan, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.It is Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.But Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mistakes have been. (Last year, in a tweet that fewer people saw, Andrew Bosworth, another Facebook vice president, claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marginal, even in a close election.‚<U+0080>ù)In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.Even before Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation had found. He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s favor was not a primary goal of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interference from outside researchers.Some of Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far ‚<U+0080><U+0094> such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would be just as effective today.In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve tried.) But it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform‚<U+0080><U+0099>s problems and protecting our democracy.Once you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve read an excellent book about climate change, which Jeff Goodell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù most certainly is, you can never unremember the facts. Elected officials may be busy arguing about whether global warming is real. But most scientists are having other arguments entirely ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about whether danger is imminent or a few decades off; about whether our prospects are dire or merely grim.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has little trouble imagining it. He opens ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù with a fictional hurricane whipping through Miami in 2037. It sweeps the Art Deco buildings of South Beach off their foundations, disgorges millions of gallons of raw sewage into Biscayne Bay and eats the last of the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s beaches. Thousands scramble for bottled water dropped by the National Guard. Zika and dengue fever start to bloom (so much moisture, so many mosquitoes). Out rush the retirees and glamour pusses; in rush the lawyers and slumlords. Within decades, the place is swallowed whole by the ocean. What was once a vibrant city is now a scuba-diving destination for intrepid historians and disaster tourists.The whole scenario seems indecently feasible by the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end.After this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù is depressingly well-timed, though I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on. Political time now lags behind geological time: If we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take dramatic steps to prepare for the rising seas, hundreds of millions could be displaced from their homes by the end of the century, and the infrastructure fringing the coast, valued in the trillions of dollars, could be lost.Unfortunately, human beings are uniquely ill-suited to prepare for disasters they cannot sense or see. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have evolved to defend ourselves from a guy with a knife or an animal with big teeth,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but we are not wired to make decisions about barely perceptible threats that gradually accelerate over time.‚<U+0080>ùSo we stick our heads in the sand. Until the sand disappears, anyway.To give you an idea of why many climate scientists are so nervous: Over the course of the earth‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history, seas have risen drastically whenever ice sheets suddenly collapsed. And that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s precisely what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening now. Greenland is melting at a furious rate ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by 2040, Goodell writes, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to windsurf at the North Pole ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and so are the ice shelves of Antarctica.Many of our climate reports, including the one that formed the basis of the 2015 Paris Agreement, hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t predicted this. Their authors assumed that the most the sea could rise by 2100 was three feet, two inches. Now many scientists believe that estimate is too low. Some say the sea could rise as much as six feet; others say even more than that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For anyone living in Miami Beach or South Brooklyn or Boston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Back Bay or any other low-lying coastal neighborhood,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the difference between three feet of sea level rise by 2100 and six feet is the difference between a wet but livable city and a submerged city.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has been writing about climate change for many years. (His previous books include ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Big Coal‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How to Cool the Planet.‚<U+0080>ù) He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the real deal, committed and making house calls. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come,‚<U+0080>ù partly built on stories he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s written for Rolling Stone, he visits cities in peril around the globe: New York; Lagos, Nigeria; Norfolk, Va.; Miami; Venice; Rotterdam. He speaks to a great many politicians, including Barack Obama, eventually asking some version of, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given what you know, aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t you scared out of your wits?‚<U+0080>ù (Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s response: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yeah.‚<U+0080>ù) At an art event, Goodell buttonholes an influential developer in Miami, Jorge P√©rez, and asks several variations of the same question. P√©rez insists he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unworried. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Besides,‚<U+0080>ù he adds, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>by that time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be dead, so what does it matter?‚<U+0080>ùThe full exchange is worth reading. It plays out like something from a Carl Hiaasen novel. All that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s missing are the twin blondes in the hot tub.Of all the American cities in this book, Miami seems least equipped to handle a rise in sea level, founded as it is on pleasure, real estate and the inalienable right to not pay state income taxes. (When a local geologist undertook a larger project to show just how much fecal matter was in Biscayne Bay, the mayor of Miami Beach went ballistic.) But every coastal city faces its own obstacles to adaptation, and the problems each one faces are different.Naval Station Norfolk, the largest navy base in the world, may have as few as 20 good years left. Yet it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s located in a climate-denial hot spot in Virginia, and it depends on more than a few climate-deniers in Congress for funding. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Many people in the military end up talking about climate in much the way eighth graders talk about sex ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with code words,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes.New York City may have more climate-change realists doing its bidding and spending its dollars. But the barrier the city plans to build to protect Wall Street ‚<U+0080><U+0094> you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to protect Wall Street, right? ‚<U+0080><U+0094> could deflect water into poorer neighborhoods. (And let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not even discuss the fate of the subways.)It is, perhaps, the world‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor who will suffer most. Goodell devotes a good deal of this book to contemplating their fate. Salty soil has already destroyed the rice crops of the Mekong Delta and Bangladesh. If the sea rises high enough, whole island nations could be washed away. The slum-dwellers of Lagos, Jakarta and other coastal cities in the developing world could be chased from their homes, many of which are already on stilts. The International Organization for Migration estimates there will be 200 million climate refugees by 2050.Yet even countries with means can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get their citizens to focus on this problem. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The average American right now,‚<U+0080>ù Obama tells Goodell, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even if they‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing.‚<U+0080>ùWater simply isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t on their minds. They‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got more pressing concerns to keep at bay.Looking for love or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>casual encounter‚<U+0080>ù? You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have to find it someplace other than Craigslist.The venerable online classifieds site removed its ‚<U+0080><U+009C>personals‚<U+0080>ù section this week, after Congress sent a bill to President Trump aimed at curtailing sex trafficking.Craigslist, little changed since it unveiled its spare text design in 1995 and began to crush the paid print classifieds business, will no longer offer a way for anonymous people to connect for romance or sex.While many people used the site to find relationships ‚<U+0080><U+0094> one of the discontinued categories is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strictly platonic‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it was no secret that some postings were thinly veiled solicitations for prostitution, despite the site‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to fight overt solicitations for money.Visitors to the personals section of Craigslist are now redirected to a short statement about the bill, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which gives law enforcement officials greater authority to go after websites used for sex trafficking, while removing protections from legal liability for hosting such content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any tool or service can be misused,‚<U+0080>ù Craigslist said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking Craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through Craigslist, we wish you every happiness!‚<U+0080>ùThe website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personals section has attracted listings of all kinds, reflecting a range of interests, sexual orientations and combinations of partners. Some users have found lasting relationships and marriage.On Friday, inventive users were already turning to other parts of Craigslist, like the famous ‚<U+0080><U+009C>missed connections‚<U+0080>ù section, to post their personals instead.Craigslist has faced criticism over its role in facilitating prostitution and trafficking before. About a decade ago, after reaching an agreement with 40 state attorneys general, it undertook a series of changes in order to curb the practices.The online forums site Reddit also removed a handful of escort-related communities in recent days, though the ban was part of a broader crackdown on the exchange of weapons, drugs, sexual services, stolen goods and falsified documents.Many survivors of sex trafficking and the illegal prostitution trade have praised the legislation as a significant advance in their fight against the practice.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It really provides both survivors and folks in law enforcement with the tools to hold websites that are knowingly facilitating trafficking accountable,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a coalition of groups that worked with the legislators who sponsored the bill.Ms. Hersh said that some websites known to have been used for trafficking have already disappeared.Some tech companies, civil liberties groups and organizations of voluntary sex workers have argued that the bill overreaches.Though its goal is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>worthy,‚<U+0080>ù the bill may have unintended consequences, Ian Thompson, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a post this month.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The bill is worded so broadly that it could even be used against platform owners that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know that their sites are being used for trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a statement after the Senate passed the bill.Even anti-trafficking organizations are not united in their support. Freedom Network USA, a coalition of groups, said in a statement that the bill would only drive voluntary sex workers further underground.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Consensual commercial sex workers use harm reduction tools such as online forums to screen clients, avoid high risk activities, share resources, and protect each other,‚<U+0080>ù it said.While Ms. Hersh acknowledged that there may be some in the sex trade who use the websites willingly, the bill, she said, will save many others from exploitation.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We work with survivors, many of whom have been exploited on these websites, and so we are seeing firsthand the extraordinary harm that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening to many women and children,‚<U+0080>ù she said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.With passage of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to stay out of the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,‚<U+0080>ù the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a wake-up call,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.‚<U+0080>ùPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And down the road, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s content from foreign governments.‚<U+0080>ùInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s required,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.‚<U+0080>ùWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law ‚<U+0080><U+009C>would almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,‚<U+0080>ù said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re opening the courthouse doors,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>acknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> trafficking‚<U+0080>ù but were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>powerless to act,‚<U+0080>ù Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The big guys can take care of themselves.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.‚<U+0080>ùNEW YORK ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The leader of a secretive group in upstate New York turned female followers into brainwashed ""slaves"" who were branded with his initials and coerced into having sex, authorities alleged on Monday in a criminal complaint charging him with sex-trafficking.Keith Raniere, co-founder of the group called Nxivm, was arrested in Mexico and returned to Texas Monday, authorities said. He was to appear in court on Tuesday in Fort Worth on the charges filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.According to the complaint, Raniere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known within the group as ""Vanguard"" ‚<U+0080><U+0094> oversaw a barbaric system in which women were told the best way to advance was to become a ""slave"" overseen by ""masters."" They also were expected to have sex with him and do menial chores for masters, and to keep the arrangement a secret or be publicly humiliated, the complaint says.The name of Raniere's attorney wasn't immediately available on Monday. In a letter attributed to Raniere previously posted on a website related to Nxivm, he denied the practices were sanctioned by the self-described self-help group.""These allegations are most disturbing to me as non-violence is one of my most important values,"" the letter said.The complaint said that many victims participated in videotaped ceremonies where they were branded in their pelvic area with a symbol featuring Raniere's initials.""During the branding ceremonies, slaves were required to be fully naked, and the master would order one slave to film while the other held down the slave being branded,"" the complaint says.Investigators said Raniere preferred exceptionally thin women, so ""slaves"" had to stick to very low-calorie diets and document every food they ate. As punishment for not following orders, women were forced to attend classes where they were ""forced to wear fake cow udders over their breasts while people called them derogatory names,"" or threatened with being put in cages, court papers say.Raniere left the United States late last year after The New York Times reported the stories of some women who defected from their secret sorority and the government began interviewing potential witnesses. He sought to cover this trail by using encrypted email and ditching his phone, court papers say.He was ultimately found staying with several women in a luxury gated community in Puerta Vallarta where villas can run $10,000 a week to rent, investigators say. After authorities took him into custody on a U.S. warrant, investigators said the women got into a high-speed car chase.The website related to the group describes Raniere as a ""scientist, mathematician, philosopher, entrepreneur, educator, inventor and author"" who has ""devoted his life to studying the human psychodynamic and developing new tools for human empowerment, expression and ethics.""Nxivm's Mexican affiliate is headed by Emiliano Salinas, a son of that country's former president. Several women who belong to the group in Mexico have traveled to Albany, where they were branded, two former Nxivm members told the Times.Salinas has also denied that the sorority is affiliated with Nxivm.Raniere and Nxivm have been the subject of criticism for years, dating back to at least 2012 when the Times Union of Albany published a series of articles examining the organization and allegations that it was like a cult.Over the years, Nxivm has attracted a following that includes Emmy Award-winning actress Allison Mack. Authorities also say Raniere has been bankrolled by Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune.Bronfman gave millions of dollars covering expenses like private air travel costing $65,000 flight, court papers say.The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies.Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive.But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Congress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t able to commit offline.‚<U+0080>ùA similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon.The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield.The bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms.Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Clearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,‚<U+0080>ù said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.‚<U+0080>ùFacebook began to change its position on the bill last fall, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,‚<U+0080>ù Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.‚<U+0080>ùSome large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills.Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.Three pastors accused of exploiting and abusing teenage girls were indicted this week on federal child sex trafficking charges in Toledo, Ohio.The men, Kenneth Butler, 37; Anthony J. Haynes, 38; and Cordell Jenkins, 47, were charged with conspiracy for child sex trafficking as part of an 11-count indictment handed down on Tuesday, the United States Attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office for the Northern District of Ohio said. The three men pleaded not guilty.They are accused of sexually assaulting a girl beginning in 2014, when she was 14, through 2017. Some of the abuse is thought to have taken place at hotels and at Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, where Mr. Haynes was a pastor and used his telephone to record the sexual assaults, prosecutors said.Mr. Haynes gave the girl money and told her not to tell anyone, saying it would ruin his family and his church, according to court documents. He ‚<U+0080><U+009C>facilitated‚<U+0080>ù the victim being abused by several other men, including Mr. Jenkins, who repeatedly sexually exploited the girl at his home, in his office at Abundant Life Ministries, and at a motel in Toledo, prosecutors said.Mr. Jenkins recorded the abuse with his cellphone and paid the girl with what he called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hush money,‚<U+0080>ù court documents said. He also allegedly abused a second girl in March of this year.Mr. Butler, who was a pastor at Kingdom Encounter Family Worship Center in Detroit, about an hour from Toledo, was also indicted on sex trafficking charges involving a third girl who was abused between 2015 and March 2017, the court documents said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three have religious affiliations and knew each other in that capacity,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Tobin, a spokesman for the United States attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three claim to be ministers in one form or another.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges are part of a superseding indictment that expands sex trafficking charges originally handed down in April against Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Haynes, and adds Mr. Butler as a defendant in the case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It takes the three of them and loops them all into one big conspiracy with three victims,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Tobin.The three men will remain in custody until their next hearing, scheduled for January.Allison Folmar, a lawyer for Mr. Jenkins, said on Thursday that he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>done a lot of good‚<U+0080>ù in his community, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but all of that is clearly overshadowed with what he is facing right now.‚<U+0080>ùA lawyer for Mr. Butler, Adam S. Nightingale, confirmed on Thursday that his client had pleaded not guilty, but did not comment further. Mr. Haynes‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer could not be reached for comment.Just before he was arrested in October, Mr. Butler posted a video on the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook page introducing himself as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pastor B,‚<U+0080>ù and saying he wanted to make a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>public apology.‚<U+0080>ù In the video, which has since been removed, he said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is never my intention to hurt or displease God. Let alone you, the people.‚<U+0080>ùMOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Nearly every day, a teenager is missing from Hawthorne Cedar Knolls, a rehabilitation center for emotionally troubled children that sits on a sprawling campus in this Westchester County town.Home to many young people who have been trafficked for sex, Hawthorne is supposed to help heal them and head off their return to prostitution and exploitation. But the center, run by a nonprofit group and intended to be a relatively open facility, has seen girl after girl, most of them from New York City, go missing.People who have worked in child welfare in and around New York City say there is a pipeline from centers like the ones here back to the streets, where children fall prey to the abuse that they were supposed to escape. Over the last 18 months, the state, which oversees residential treatment centers like Hawthorne, stopped sending children to Hawthorne and to the nearby Pleasantville Cottage School. Among the 51 centers statewide, Hawthorne and Pleasantville are the only ones to have faced such severe sanctions over missing children in recent years.By design and by law, conditions at residential treatment centers are less restrictive than those at many of the other programs for children with severe mental health problems. Residential treatment centers are not juvenile detention centers, and they are supposed to provide a homelike experience. Children cannot be locked down, and older children are encouraged to attend programs outside the campus and hold part-time jobs as part of their rehabilitation. But people who work with the residents said that a lack of rigorous, engaging programs, especially for victims of sex trafficking, had made their open atmosphere a liability.Hawthorne was recently drawn into a trafficking investigation after a teenage girl who went missing from Hawthorne ended up in the Bronx with a 25-year-old man.The man has been charged with sex trafficking, rape, prostitution and other crimes in a state case involving the girl, and he has been charged as a conspirator in a federal investigation of a Bronx drug-trafficking ring.Prosecutors have not accused Hawthorne or its staff of any wrongdoing in connection with sex trafficking. But the involvement of a runaway from Hawthorne in the Bronx case underscored the challenges confronting such programs and the risks faced by some of the girls who are in them.The investigation offers a glimpse into an underworld in which exploitation is hard to document and prosecute. Victims often fear retribution or are wary of law enforcement and refuse to cooperate with investigations, according to lawyers and social workers. But the exploitation is real, said Paul Oliva, the police chief in Mount Pleasant. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We had these girls leaving campus, hooking up with their pimps,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Instead of escaping sexual exploitation, some teenagers are recruited by their peers inside centers and group homes, said Ed Gavin, a former acting chief of staff at the Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services in New York City. A piece of the pipeline in the region flows north to south, from the leafy, idyllic surroundings here to gritty ‚<U+0080><U+009C>trap houses‚<U+0080>ù run by twentysomething drug dealers, Mr. Gavin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People think of human trafficking as foreign. Human trafficking goes on right in the neighborhood. It goes on in the Bronx,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Gavin, who now works as a private investigator and specializes in finding missing children.The girls at Hawthorne, who range in age from 12 to 21, have been sent there through the recommendations of child welfare agencies, Family Court judges and a special education panel.The majority of the children return to their homes or are sent to a foster home or other setting closer to their families in less than a year, said David Rivel, the chief executive of the Jewish Board of Family and Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, which operates Hawthorne.Many children continue to run until they feel safe at the center, he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kids are not running away from the campus, they are running away from the trauma and abuse they have experienced, which we are encouraging them to face,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rivel said.To prevent children from regressing, there must be a balance between tough love and tolerance of behavioral problems that stem from deep-seated pain, said Jonathan McLean, the director of Hawthorne.The town of Mount Pleasant has long been home to Hawthorne and Pleasantville, which is run by the J.C.C.A., formerly known as the Jewish Child Care Association.About two miles apart, the campuses opened more than a century ago to take in the orphaned children of Jewish immigrants.About 80 young people children live at Pleasantville, while about 50 live at Hawthorne. The overwhelming majority of the residents there are black and Hispanic children from New York City.In an interview, an 18-year-old at Gateways, a program on Pleasantville‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campus for trafficked children, said she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sold her body for money,‚<U+0080>ù new clothes, trips to the nail salon and food.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I always have this thing where I bounce my way into stuff and bounce my way into this,‚<U+0080>ù the teenager said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to explain why people do it or why you do it.‚<U+0080>ùThe teenager said she had enjoyed a visit by local volunteers who brought Jamaican food, cupcakes and pumpkins, but she said she wished some of the staff members were more empathetic. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Be more open and understanding of behaviors. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t shut us out,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Making children feel wanted is key to preventing them from going missing, said Jim Purcell, the chief executive of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, an advocacy group. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For some of these kids, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s showing that someone cares,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Some of these kids AWOL to see if somebody is going to stop them.‚<U+0080>ùChief Oliva said his department, which has 45 officers, was stretched thin by helping to investigate sex trafficking cases involving missing girls, and by responding to calls from the centers and complaints from residents.To push the nonprofits to improve security, the town began charging them a fine of $250 last year for calls about missing children, he said. (As of October, the town had issued the fine 15 times.) The fines were instituted in part because residents had complained about crimes committed by children from the centers, but Mr. Oliva said it was important to remember that the children were being hurt or put in harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.From July 2016 though June, about 73 percent of the 188 New York City children at Hawthorne were reported missing, a rate that was significantly higher than those for similar programs.Mr. Rivel said the numbers at Hawthorne had been skewed by the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>overreporting‚<U+0080>ù of cases in which children had gone missing for just a few hours, but he did not dispute that the numbers reflected a crisis and that elected officials needed to help. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have a real problem here, a real challenge here,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Last year, the Jewish Board and J.C.C.A. hired directors of security, new positions for both nonprofits.At Pleasantville, the J.C.C.A. added more cameras, new lighting and new two-way radios. At Hawthorne, the Jewish Board began following children in a van on the 20-minute walk from the campus to the nearby Metro-North Railroad station. The board also installed a six-foot-high fence that stretches 200 feet through trees and brush.The tactics have reduced the number of children who go missing, though the figure remains strikingly high at Hawthorne. Since the state allowed Hawthorne to begin accepting new residents in August, about 54 percent of the 79 New York City children living there have been absent at some point, according to city data.But the idea of using highly restrictive security measures is at odds with a strong belief by many experts that emotionally damaged children should not be criminalized.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honestly, their goal is to protect these kids,‚<U+0080>ù said Staca Shehan, the executive director of the case analysis division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But at the end of the day, there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a way to force services upon them,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The field as a whole really doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have a consensus because running away from services is so prevalent.‚<U+0080>ùAdvocates said there was a need for more state funding for programs that engage children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those are the things that get lost in the shuffle when there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no money,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Purcell said.Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, a Queens Democrat who is the chairman of the social services committee, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has cut the operating budgets of the agencies that oversee troubled children by nearly 17 percent since fiscal 2012 to keep a vow to curb state spending.The state described the cuts as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cost savings‚<U+0080>ù unrelated to the direct funding of treatment centers.The state provides money to local districts that negotiate annual rates with the nonprofit organizations that run the centers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Jewish Board receives $419.78 per day for each child, and the J.C.C.A. receives $431.36. The state could set higher rates for the next fiscal year because of the cost of the new security measures at Hawthorne and Pleasantville, state officials said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After a bruising week before lawmakers, big internet companies including Facebook and Google relented to pressure in Washington on Friday and agreed to support a sex trafficking bill they had vehemently opposed for months.The bill would allow victims to sue websites that knowingly support and assist sex trafficking on their site. State attorneys general would also be able to go after the websites that support sex trafficking content.The companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.Under those conditions, the bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act, became an unpopular lobbying battle for the tech companies. Rivals such as the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Oracle and HP joined civil rights groups like National Urban League in support of the Senate bill.After weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill ‚<U+0080><U+009C>will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The bill amends Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, established in 1996, that protects online companies from liability over content they hosted on their sites. Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Removing the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shield of immunity,‚<U+0080>ù said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate‚<U+0080><U+0099>s latest effort to crack down on online sex trafficking is designed for success. Proposed legislation has an unassailable title, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017, and bipartisan support. And it targets websites that knowingly facilitate the work of sexual predators online.But the bill is running into vigorous opposition from technology companies and digital rights groups alarmed at the potential infringement of online speech.So far, the bill, which would amend the Communications Decency Act, is sponsored by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and a group of 26 other senators, including eight Democrats.It follows the culmination of a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website notorious for prostitution and trafficking ads.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Finally, victims of human trafficking are going to see justice when we get this passed, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really important to many of us who have been following this,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. This summer, the committee recommended that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s connection to online sex trafficking, citing evidence that Backpage employees were instructed to delete flagged words indicative of trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lolita,‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>rape,‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>teenage‚<U+0080>ù among them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before publishing the advertisements online.In federal and state investigations, Backpage has successfully cited as a defense Section 230 of the decency act, which says that websites cannot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.‚<U+0080>ùIf passed, the Portman bill would clarify that Section 230 cannot shield a website from federal trafficking laws. It would also impose liability for knowingly assisting and facilitating online sex trafficking, and allow civil suits related to sex trafficking.Backpage.com officials did not respond to requests for comment. The website announced in January that it had formally closed its adult section after the Senate investigation found that employers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>knowingly facilitated the criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls,‚<U+0080>ù but trafficking advertisements have been reported in the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dating section.The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which praised the bill in a letter to senators this week, reported that 73 percent of reported sex trafficking was traced through advertisements on websites like Backpage.However, some lawyers and members of the technology community say that while they support the policing of websites that knowingly encourage sex trafficking, the broad language of the bill opens other online entities to new legal challenges. With the potential for lawsuits, there is concern that websites would begin to actively and pre-emptively delete and police users‚<U+0080><U+0099> posts and videos.A similar bill introduced in the House in April, which would not only modify the decency act but create harsher penalties for providers found to have had knowledge of sex trafficking, has been criticized for being even broader than the Senate bill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It would be good for the drafters of the bill to engage seriously with the nontrivial objections that are meant to support freedom of expression online, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not freedom of expression to sex traffic,‚<U+0080>ù said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor of internet law at Harvard, emphasizing that critics were not arguing against prosecuting websites like Backpage.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried about sites that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t resemble Backpage at all running into trouble if the immunity is lifted,‚<U+0080>ù he said. Like many other critics of the bill, Mr. Zittrain said he would prefer narrower language or the chance to prosecute websites under current legislation, including the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015.And despite the strong bipartisan support in Congress, the bill will have to overcome dissent from other lawmakers and Silicon Valley executives concerned about freedom of speech on the internet.But Senate staff members involved in the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development said that they had made an effort to work with tech companies concerned about modifying the decency act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We did our due diligence, met these folks on a bipartisan basis for months, and yet they offered no constructive feedback,‚<U+0080>ù said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sad that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d oppose a narrowly crafted, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who was partially responsible for the inclusion of Section 230 in the decency act while serving in the House, said the bill was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another example of the technical ignorance of Congress threatening the jobs, lives and economic opportunities of millions of Americans.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This bill will make it less likely that tech companies help the victims this bill is meant to protect,‚<U+0080>ù he said Tuesday in a statement.Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents major online companies, said in a statement that the bill would create ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a new wave of frivolous and unpredictable actions against legitimate companies rather than addressing underlying criminal behavior.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Portman said such criticism of the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language was unfounded. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seems like a stretch to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that he felt the bill clearly targeted companies complicit in trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The alternative is not to do nothing and allow these girls and women to continue to get thwarted in every effort they make to seek justice,‚<U+0080>ù he said.In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday night, Mr. Portman argued that the bill preserved the decency act‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good Samaritan‚<U+0080>ù provision, which protects websites that regulate their content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This provision simply protects good actors who proactively block or screen for offensive material and thus shields them from any frivolous lawsuits,‚<U+0080>ù he said.For Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in particular phrases like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>assist, support or facilitate sex trafficking‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>conduct violates federal criminal law‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are too vague in defining what constitutes facilitation and violation. While she supports modest change to the statute, she said she would rather see the courts re-evaluate their interpretation of the law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s specific language.Critics also say the bill opens up websites to potential prosecution by states, a change that could force sites to make costly modifications to meet state laws or expose them to expensive litigation if a law is changed or accidentally ignored, said Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties online.It is a cost that tech giants like Google, YouTube and Twitter can handle, but that would likely stifle the development of new and smaller websites.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I worry about the next Google, the next Twitter, the next emerging platform that we would grow to love,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. McSherry said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never exist because that platform, that business would never get off the ground.‚<U+0080>ùCHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The young women, many of them from poor families in Thailand, were promised trips to the United States. They would also receive visas. Life in cities like Chicago would be rosy, they were told, and they would be able to help support their families back home.But the promises, the federal authorities say, came with an enormous toll: The women were required to work as prostitutes in cities all over this country until they could pay off exorbitant ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bondage debts,‚<U+0080>ù set as high as $60,000, to the very people who had promised them better lives.Law enforcement authorities on Thursday announced federal sex-trafficking conspiracy charges against 21 people, part of what they described as one of the most elaborate and extensive sex-trafficking operations they had seen. The operation had gone on for at least eight years, netted tens of millions of dollars, and involved hundreds of women who were shuttled among American cities, sometimes every few weeks, the officials said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The women did not have freedom of movement and, until they paid off their bondage debts, were modern-day sex slaves,‚<U+0080>ù an indictment unsealed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Minnesota said, laying out criminal counts against a long list of defendants, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. Gregory Brooker, the acting United States attorney in Minnesota, described the ring as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a multimillion-dollar, modern-day organized crime operation.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the eight-count indictment, the operation was intricate for its organization. Among those indicted were the people owed the bondage debts of the women brought from Bangkok. Others who were indicted served as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>house bosses‚<U+0080>ù in cities like Austin, Tex.; Chicago; Dallas; and Los Angeles, where they used apartments, hotels, houses and massage parlors for prostitution. Still others served as money launderers, putting cash returns into bank accounts, and facilitators, who took care of details like flying the women from city to city.While still in Thailand, the women were usually told that they would work as prostitutes, the indictment said, but the terms of the deals shifted substantially once they arrived in the United States. Threats were made. Bondage debts suddenly skyrocketed. Some women were even told to have plastic surgery to make them more ‚<U+0080><U+009C>appealing‚<U+0080>ù to customers, then ordered to reimburse the cost of surgery as part of their ever-growing debt.The authorities said the women were kept isolated and were not allowed to leave the prostitution houses without being accompanied by one of the ring organizers. The hours of prostitution often ran all day, every day.Officials said some of the women are now being helped by agencies to find housing and other assistance. But their immigration status in this country is uncertain; many were brought here with visas obtained using false information, the authorities said, including fictitious occupations and phony backgrounds. One of the main reasons women had accepted such deals in the first place, the officials said, was the promise of a legitimate visa.By Thursday, 20 of the 21 accused ‚<U+0080><U+0094> all of whom were described as organizers of the operation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had been arrested in various cities. More than a dozen others were arrested in connection with the ring last fall, officials said. In making the latest arrests in places like Chicago, Houston and San Diego, the authorities said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, along with cellphones, weapons and condoms. Lawyers for those arrested could not immediately be reached. Ten of the accused are Thai nationals; the rest are American citizens, the authorities said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Is this going to stop sex trafficking from going on? No,‚<U+0080>ù said Thomas J. Dart, the sheriff of Cook County, Ill., whose agency took part in the sprawling investigation. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no na√Øvet√© here. The notion that we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to eradicate this sort of thing is never going to happen until our society decides it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong.‚<U+0080>ù"
