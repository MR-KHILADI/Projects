"1","Kat Sullivan was on a plane to Orlando, Fla., in February when she watched ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚<U+0080>ù for the first time, a movie about a woman who puts pressure on the local police to find her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s killer by renting out a series of giant advertising signs.That, Ms. Sullivan thought, was a good idea.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m getting a goddamn billboard,‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That woman totally epitomizes the feeling of just having to do something.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said that she was sexually abused and then raped by a former teacher when she was a student at the Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., in the 1990s. A report commissioned by Emma Willard concluded that a teacher there named Scott Sargent had been fired for sexually abusing a student but was still given letters of recommendations to teach elsewhere; Ms. Sullivan was that student.Because the abuse took place 20 years ago, the statute of limitations has long since run out, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So, using money from a settlement she received from the school, she bought a month‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth of ad space on three digital billboards, each about 50 feet wide, to call attention to the case.One billboard is in Albany, not far from Emma Willard. Another is on I-95 in Fairfield, Conn., near a school where Mr. Sargent later taught. The third is alongside I-90 in Springfield, Mass., near the town where Mr. Sargent lives today.Three images will rotate through each billboard. One points people to Ms. Sullivan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, and says, across a picture of a man with a question mark over his chest, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the truth will be revealed.‚<U+0080>ù Another is a picture of Ms. Sullivan and says: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My rapist is protected by New York state law. I am not. Neither are you. Neither are your children.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said the original design included Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and face, but that the company that owns the billboards would not allow her to use them, for fear of getting sued. Two billboard companies said they would not work with her at all.The three billboards will be up for 28 days, Ms. Sullivan said, which will cost her $14,000. (She spent about another $2,000 on the website.) Once the billboards come down, Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and photograph will appear on her website.Mr. Sargent did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement, Emma Willard said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We commend and support the survivors of sexual abuse who are committed to affecting change on this important issue.‚<U+0080>ùThe third graphic that will rotate through the billboards says ‚<U+0080><U+009C>NY Pass The Child Victims Act,‚<U+0080>ù a piece of proposed legislation in Albany that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges and allow them to sue until age 50. It would also create a one-year ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lookback‚<U+0080>ù window, during which cases from any time could proceed in court. Today, the statutes of limitations in New York that govern the sexual abuse of children are among the most restrictive in the country. Most adult survivors had until they were 23 years old, at the latest, to bring a case.Activist groups have been pushing the Child Victims Act in Albany for more than 10 years, and have made an especially aggressive effort this year, targeting specific state senators. Ms. Sullivan moved to New York City last month from her home in Florida to help lobby for the measure.Supporters are trying to make the act part of the state budget, which is due April 1 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a tactic that would give Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who supports the bill, more leverage to negotiate with legislators. The Child Victims Act has support from the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, but there is resistance to it in the Republican-controlled State Senate, which has blocked the bill for years. John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader, did not respond to questions about the legislation.A central sticking point is the lookback window. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said on Tuesday that any legislation that included it should be rejected and called the window ‚<U+0080><U+009C>toxic‚<U+0080>ù for the Catholic Church. Representatives of the church have said it supports changing the statute of limitations, but fears a flurry of lawsuits and the financial hit a lookback window might deliver.But proponents of the legislation have said that hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t happened in states that have enacted similar legislation, and they call the window crucial. In addition to providing victims their day in court, they said the window serves a public-safety function by flushing out suspected abusers who are still in the community.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The lookback window will help identify abusers, many of whom still have contact with kids,‚<U+0080>ù said State Senator Brad Hoylman, Democrat of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill in the Senate. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>New York has among the worst laws in the country on child sexual abuse. We are an outlier, so this fix is a long time coming.‚<U+0080>ùThe billboards strategy was used by activists in London pushing for arrests in the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people last year, who last month deployed three roving billboards to ask why there had been no arrests in the tragedy.Ms. Sullivan said she was motivated by the frustration that Mr. Sargent has faced no major consequences.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is free to teach, free to coach, free to be elected onto boards,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are no blemishes on his record.‚<U+0080>ùEAST LANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The investigation began with the goal of uncovering how Michigan State University officials had failed to prevent Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar from assaulting hundreds of young women over decades. But the inquiry took a stunning turn on Tuesday when a university dean was accused not just of facilitating Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, but of committing sexual misconduct himself.Dr. William D. Strampel, who worked as Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss at the College of Osteopathic Medicine, was accused by investigators of grabbing the buttocks of two female medical students. He suggested that one young woman leave school and become a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>centerfold model,‚<U+0080>ù investigators said. And he stored nude ‚<U+0080><U+009C>selfies,‚<U+0080>ù apparently of Michigan State students, on his work computer, court documents say, along with a video of Dr. Nassar performing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treatment‚<U+0080>ù on a young patient.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As dean of the college, Strampel used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition and sexually assault female students,‚<U+0080>ù a detective from Michigan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statewide police agency wrote in an affidavit.The arrest of Dr. Strampel, who is 70 and was for 15 years the highest-ranking official at the osteopathic college, compounded the crisis facing Michigan State. It has seen its reputation devastated in recent months as scores of women recounted abuse by Dr. Nassar, a longtime university sports doctor. Women have described a corrupt culture at the university that diminished or ignored the complaints some of them made about Dr. Nassar as far back as the late 1990s. Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, Lou Anna K. Simon, left under pressure in January and trustees have faced calls to resign, even as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigation into the university was expected to continue and additional charges were possible.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another blow to the university,‚<U+0080>ù Tom Leonard, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, said of the charges against Dr. Strampel. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an absolute disgrace.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Strampel ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who stepped down in December from his job as dean, where he made more than $383,000 annually, according to MLive, a local news outlet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was charged with misconduct of a public official, a felony, and three misdemeanors, including fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of willful neglect of duty. Dr. Strampel was jailed on Monday, and appeared in court via video on Tuesday afternoon wearing a gray sweatshirt, his hands cuffed in front of him. A personal recognizance bond was set at $25,000, and Dr. Strampel was ordered not to contact current or former students, and not to leave the state.John Dakmak, a lawyer for Dr. Strampel, said his client planned to fight the charges and denied all of the counts against him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone, any student or otherwise,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Dakmak said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors in exchange for any type of standing within the university or the medical school.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges against Dr. Strampel come as prosecutors pursue a sprawling investigation of the university, which began after Dr. Nassar, a longtime physician for Michigan State and for U.S.A. Gymnastics, admitted sexually abusing young women and was sentenced to prison in hearings that drew international attention. Dozens of women, including Olympic gymnasts, described assaults committed under the guise of medical care. At least 265 people have said they were abused by Dr. Nassar.Prosecutors said Dr. Strampel failed to take steps to protect patients from Dr. Nassar when allegations of abuse emerged. He neglected, the prosecutors said, to follow a set of protocols that would, for instance, have required Dr. Nassar to conduct exams only with other staff members present. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Despite his representation of his (and the college‚<U+0080><U+0099>s) intended response to the allegations against Nassar, Strampel did not actually enforce or monitor these protocols, nor did he alert other employees in the Sports Medicine Clinic about the existence of the protocols,‚<U+0080>ù the charging documents said.The police detective‚<U+0080><U+0099>s affidavit outlining the charges also described a series of disturbing interactions between Dr. Strampel and four female medical students, none of whom were named publicly. In several of the cases, the women said they had gone to meet with Dr. Strampel to discuss their academic work but that he had turned the conversation to other topics.One woman who said she had been summoned to Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office after falling asleep in class said that he told her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>turn around in a circle twice so that he could observe her body,‚<U+0080>ù and that he said that she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.‚<U+0080>ù When she was later called to a dinner honoring scholarship recipients at a club on Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s golf course, she said Dr. Strampel reached around and gripped her buttock as they posed for photos, according to the affidavit.Another student who had failed a medical school test said she was required to meet with Dr. Strampel, who asked her what her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Plan B‚<U+0080>ù was since ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she could not cut it in medical school.‚<U+0080>ù The student said Dr. Strampel told her he would do her a favor by letting her take the exam again, but that she would then be required to do anything for him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given the context,‚<U+0080>ù the affidavit said, the woman ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understood that she was being asked to do anything he wanted sexually in exchange for the favor.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, Dr. Nicole Eastman, who graduated from the school in 2010 and who said that she was interviewed by investigators in the case, said that Dr. Strampel made inappropriate sexual remarks, beginning soon after she started school in 2006.At one point, he told her, laughing and boasting, that it was easy to get women drunk, she said. Another time, she said, he grabbed her buttock at a crowded event, in full view of his wife, who was standing nearby.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I just remember how humiliating it was,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People knew about his behavior, and even if they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t inappropriately touched by him, they knew. And now we know that his behavior enabled Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Eastman said she told a Michigan State employee while she was in school about Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. The employee looked resigned, Dr. Eastman recalled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Everybody knows about his behavior and nothing ever changes,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like a defeated kind of tone. When I think back to that, it was like she felt powerless.‚<U+0080>ùThe charging documents said Dr. Strampel also made graphic sexual comments, solicited nude photos from at least one student, and stored dozens of pornographic images and videos on a computer in his office, including many images that appeared to be of Michigan State students.Rachael Denhollander, who said Dr. Nassar abused her, said Tuesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges reflected a systemic failure at Michigan State.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is shocking but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not shocking,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone like Larry doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get away with becoming the worst sexual abuser in history in plain sight if he were not surrounded by people who had no problem with his conduct and did not think it was a big deal.‚<U+0080>ùMichigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interim president, John Engler, last month took steps to start the process of revoking Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tenure. University officials did not answer questions Tuesday about the status of the revocation, and did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Engler.For years, university officials largely dismissed reports that Dr. Nassar had assaulted women, even though some women said they had reported abuse years ago to coaches, trainers or counselors.On Tuesday, State Senator Margaret O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien, a Republican, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>this university needs to own up to what it did.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just go away,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should know that by now.‚<U+0080>ùOn the campus of Michigan State, students said they were unsettled by the arrest of Dr. Strampel, who came to the College of Osteopathic Medicine in the 1990s after a career that included stints in the surgeon general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and several hospitals.The college enrolls more than 1,200 students and graduates about 300 physicians each year. Graduates earn a D.O. degree instead of the more common M.D., but are full-fledged doctors able to prescribe medication, perform surgeries and choose any specialty. Students also study the osteopathic techniques of manipulating the spine, muscles and bones to diagnose and treat patients.Dr. Strampel, who could face up to nine years in prison if convicted of all charges, arrived at his home outside Lansing after his court appearance on Tuesday afternoon. A woman who came to the door declined to comment.Aly Raisman, an Olympic gymnast who said Dr. Nassar abused her, wrote on Instagram that the charges against Dr. Strampel were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another painful example‚<U+0080>ù of how so much had been mishandled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clear that failing to investigate and understand how this abuse could go on for so long is just asking history to repeat itself,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Raisman, who called for a broader investigation ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that looks into everything, not just Nassar.‚<U+0080>ùAn American swimmer who competed in the 2012 Olympics has accused her former coach of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.The swimmer, Ariana Kukors, 28, said in a statement on Wednesday that the coach, Sean Hutchison, began sexually abusing her when she was 16 and had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>grooming‚<U+0080>ù her for three years before that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kukors said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement emailed by his lawyer, Mr. Hutchison, 46, said Thursday that the accusations were not true. He said that the two had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>committed relationship‚<U+0080>ù that began after she was of age and that they had lived together for more than a year after the 2012 Olympic Games.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to ‚<U+0080><U+0098>groom‚<U+0080><U+0099> her.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her younger sister also lived with us for several months and her mother was a regular visitor to our home,‚<U+0080>ù the statement added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that she would make these wild allegations all these years later.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawyer, Brad Meryhew, said Mr. Hutchison would not comment further.In response to Mr. Hutchison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, B. Robert Allard, one of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers, said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana was groomed and manipulated as a minor by her trusted swim coach. He sexually assaulted her starting when she was 16. This abusive relationship continued until the age of 24. I would hardly characterize this a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>committed relationship‚<U+0080><U+0099> in the sense of two consenting adults who freely and willingly engage in healthy relations. There is nothing healthy about childhood sexual abuse.‚<U+0080>ùThe United States Homeland Security Department is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>still in the very preliminary stages‚<U+0080>ù of an investigation into this case, Lori Haley, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an email on Thursday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But our top priority in all cases involving alleged online child exploitation is identifying any possible minor victims.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Kukors once held the world record for the 200-meter individual medley and has won medals at several international competitions. She competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.Mr. Hutchison has worked with several Olympic swimmers, including the medalists Margaret Hoelzer, Caroline Burckle and Kara Lynn Joyce. He was an assistant coach for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s swimming team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.He met Ms. Kukors when he was a coach at King Aquatic Club in Seattle, according to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement.In a statement on Thursday, Michael Brooks, the head coach at the club, said that news of the allegations ‚<U+0080><U+009C>broke our collective hearts.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana Kukors is part of the King Aquatic family and we only want the best for her,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Brooks said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our staff is meeting to review this devastating news. Sean Hutchison has stepped down as an executive with King and has had no direct interaction with our swimmers for a very long time.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Allard said that U.S.A. Swimming had been given notice in 2010 about the inappropriate coach-athlete relationship but had done nothing.U.S.A. Swimming, the organization that governs the sport in the United States, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became aware of a rumored relationship between Hutchison and then 21-year-old Ariana via a third-party‚<U+0080>ù in 2010. (The organization said Mr. Hutchison does not work for the organization, but he once had a coach membership and remains a nonathlete member.)U.S.A. Swimming said that it conducted an investigation into the rumor in 2010, but that Ms. Kukors and Mr. Hutchison both ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unequivocally denied the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship,‚<U+0080>ù and the case was closed.In light of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, the organization expressed support for her and other victims ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in their quest to break their silence and confront their horrific experiences.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, she realized that she had been abused only ‚<U+0080><U+009C>through recent therapy and after years of suppressing memories of the pain and suffering,‚<U+0080>ù and that she was coming forward with her story on the recommendation of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates.Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement follows on the heels of a dramatic sentencing hearing for Lawrence G. Nassar, a medical professional who was convicted of sexually abusing the young gymnasts, including Olympians, who were his patients. At least 265 girls and women have accused him of abuse, including while an F.B.I. inquiry into the allegations was underway.Uproar over the slow response to the allegations led the board of directors of U.S.A. Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the United States, to resign.The sexual misconduct allegations against the former Fox News host Bill O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly and the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the confidential settlements arising from those accusations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have prompted a provision in the  final tax bill that aims to stem the use of nondisclosure agreements.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, proposed the amendment last month. It says any settlement, payout or lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse could not be deducted as a business expense if such payments were subject to a nondisclosure agreement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think most Americans would be outraged to know that they are subsidizing sexual predators in the tax code,‚<U+0080>ù he said in an emailed statement.But the proposed changes may not deter some companies and businesses from seeking confidentiality.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a nudge, not a hammer,‚<U+0080>ù Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an expert in tax policy, said in a phone interview on Saturday.Publicly known sexual harassment settlements involving Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who is said to have used nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have totaled about $45 million, including a $32 million payout that he paid personally.Mr. Weinstein, whose abuse of women was exposed by The New York Times in October, also has used confidentiality agreements. The Times reported that Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment.Under the tax bill spearheaded by Republicans, a hypothetical company that paid a $10 million sexual abuse settlement would not be able to take a deduction on that amount if the payout had a nondisclosure agreement attached to it.In the absence of a confidentiality agreement, however, the new corporate tax rate would allow the company to save $2.1 million in taxes, making its out-of-pocket cost $7.9 million.For a business that generates billions in revenue, like the parent company of Fox News, a nondisclosure agreement can have far more value than tax savings.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new rules are very well-intentioned, but the impact is likely to only be symbolic,‚<U+0080>ù Gordon Klein, a lawyer, certified public accountant and faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Anderson School of Management, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The reason for that is companies cherish nondisclosure agreements because they significantly help protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and protect them from follow-on lawsuits or additional lawsuits.‚<U+0080>ùThe nonspecific language of the amendment also complicated matters, Mr. Klein said.The bill refers to settlements or payments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>related‚<U+0080>ù to sexual harassment or sexual abuse, he said, but what if only one portion of the allegations is about sexual harassment? And does it matter if the sexual harassment was merely an allegation, or does there need to be evidence of sexual harassment? Are the lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees limited to the time spent drafting the settlement, or to all of the fees associated with the settlement?Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, proposed a similar amendment for the House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tax reform bill but it did not include a stipulation about confidentiality agreements.In the end, the language in the Senate bill offered by Mr. Menendez made the final cut when lawmakers blended the two bills together. Democrats have heavily criticized the proposed tax bill and complained they were shut out of the legislative process.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the reason, in all honestly, why there was no pushback was because it was a revenue generator,‚<U+0080>ù Tricia Enright, Mr. Menendez‚<U+0080><U+0099>s press secretary, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They determined that it would be seen on the plus-side of the ledger.‚<U+0080>ùWhile the new tax plan would allow businesses to write off legal fees related to sexual harassment payouts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> provided they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not tied to nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it is a different situation for employees who make claims of sexual abuse or harassment.In those cases, plaintiffs will no longer be able to write off their legal fees. A plaintiff could ordinarily claim such an expense as an itemized deduction, but the Republican plan has eliminated that option, Mr. Hemel said, adding that it creates ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a one-sidedness.‚<U+0080>ùROME ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After his spirited defense of a Chilean bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse prompted the greatest crisis of his pontificate, Pope Francis reactivated an abuse commission on Saturday that had lapsed into dormancy.It was the latest in a series of measures by the Vatican to counter criticism that fighting abuse was not a priority for Francis‚<U+0080><U+0099> papacy.Cardinal Sean O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley of Boston was reappointed as the leader of the group, called the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. A Vatican statement said the panel would include some victims of clerical sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm,‚<U+0080>ù Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley said in a statement.The Vatican statement said the abuse victims on the commission preferred to keep their histories private.The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December, and its lapsing coincided with growing criticism of the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to addressing sexual abuse in the church. The group plans to begin its work in April by hearing the testimony of abuse victims.The Vatican statement said the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s goal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and greatest challenge‚<U+0080>ù remained embedding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>abuse prevention and protection into the life and action of local churches.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement about the commission came on the same day that the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most experienced sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, was expected to take testimony in New York from Juan Carlos Cruz, who says that he was sexually abused when he was a teenager in Chile by a priest and that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had witnessed the abuse.While visiting Chile last month, the pope initially defended Bishop Barros as a victim of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>calumny,‚<U+0080>ù saying that the Vatican had received no concrete evidence against the bishop.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,‚<U+0080>ù Francis said at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander.‚<U+0080>ùThe comments caused outrage in Chile, and Francis, amid intense pressure, dispatched Archbishop Scicluna to investigate.On Thursday, the Civilt√† Cattolica, a Jesuit journal, published the private remarks the pope made during a visit to Peru last month, in which he disclosed that he regularly met with victims of sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father meets victims of sexual abuse, either individually or in groups, several times a month,‚<U+0080>ù Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman, confirmed in a statement. He added that the pope ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tries to help them heal the grave wounds caused by the abuses they suffered.‚<U+0080>ùMany advocates for abuse survivors accused the pope of opening up a wound by saying there was no evidence that Bishop Barros had covered up abuse. It then emerged that the pope had personally received an eight-page letter in 2015 containing testimony against the bishop, and that Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley had delivered it.Eight members of the commission were reappointed, and nine others are new to the panel. Its experts, which include lay academics and psychologists, priests and nuns, come from several countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Tonga. Ten are non-clerics and eight are women, including three nuns.Two abuse survivors previously left the commission in frustration. And the pope did not reappoint six lay members who advocates for the abused considered among the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most active leaders.CHARLOTTE, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Back in court Wednesday for his third and final sentencing hearing, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports clinic doctor, heard statements from more than 20 accusers, many of whom shared accounts of sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar at a local gymnastics club known for grooming stars.Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers include elite athletes, such as the Olympic medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas. But the speakers in court on Wednesday were not global superstars. They were mostly regular teenagers who told of being charmed by Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strange laugh‚<U+0080>ù and by the autographed posters of revered gymnasts on the walls of his office at the Michigan State sports clinic.Twistars Gymnastics Club, outside Lansing, Mich., was supposed to catapult young female athletes to a fruitful career, under the guidance of John Geddert, who owned the gym and coached there. Instead it became a site of anguish and devastation, according to the statements, some of which described long-lasting injuries, both mental and physical, inflicted by the doctor known as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>healer of gymnasts.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, more than 150 young women and teenagers finished publicly confronting Dr. Nassar during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. He has received sentences of 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography and of 40 to 175 years for the sexual abuse charges in Ingham County.Starting Wednesday, 65 women were scheduled to speak here in Eaton County Circuit Court this week. The judge, Janice K. Cunningham, said that the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265, some of whom chose to remain anonymous.Unlike the Ingham County judge, Rosemarie E. Aquilina, whose frequent commentary throughout the hearing there was met with a mix of praise and disapproval, Judge Cunningham kept her comments concise and subdued, primarily expressing appreciation for the victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> bravery.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is almost beyond comprehension to listen to young women in high school to stand at that podium and come forward with their story,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Dr. Nassar, wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, remained stoic with his head hanging low throughout the first day of the hearing, which included statements from 29 of the accusers, 22 of whom had not previously offered a statement in Ingham County.The first speaker, Jessica Thomashow, said she had been assaulted by Dr. Nassar as early as age 9, at Twistars.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The way it worked at Twistars was that, if you were injured, you were specifically instructed to see Larry Nassar, not your family doctor,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Thomashow said. She recalled being excited to see the famed Dr. Nassar for a rib injury.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into the back room and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when everything changed,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to the room Dr. Nassar used at Twistars.Another victim, Bailey Lorencen, whose statement was read for her, referred to Twistars‚<U+0080><U+0099> back room as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dungeon.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is clear that in an environment like Twistars, a monster like Nassar would thrive,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lorencen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said.Dr. Nassar pleaded guilty here in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13, according to a plea agreement.The agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011, some of it under the guise of medical treatment. A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars.Dr. Nassar will be sentenced after the victims speak. The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the counts.The case has reverberated in the sports world, and it led to the resignation of the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board of directors.At Michigan State, the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president, after the longtime president Lou Anna Simon resigned last week. But Mr. Engler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appointment has already been met with student protests, and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faculty senate is debating a vote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no confidence‚<U+0080>ù in the board. The vote could come as soon as next week.The stories told Wednesday by the young women and by athletes‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents, some of whom had been in the room while Dr. Nassar abused their daughters, painted an image of a dark side in gymnastics culture. Many of the victims said the pressure to rise in the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ranks had contributed to their decisions not to report the abuse sooner.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I kept thinking, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a doctor, stop overreacting,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Katherine Ebert said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t overreacting.‚<U+0080>ùMadison Bonofiglio, whose statement was read by Angela Povilaitis, the assistant attorney general, said she had dismissed her feelings while she was being abused for fear of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>upsetting‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are judged by your body, your looks, your cuteness factor, and then your skill,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.The young women said that they were told they had no choice but to see Dr. Nassar and that he had lulled them into trusting him. He lit the fireplace to keep athletes warm when ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treating‚<U+0080>ù them in his basement, where the abuse often occurred, they said. Dr. Nassar often gave gifts, such as souvenir pins, necklaces and treats, according to some of the statements.Amy Preston, the mother of a 19-year-old who was abused by Dr. Nassar as a child, said he had brought the girl waffles with fresh berries and whipped cream. He often consoled gymnasts when Mr. Geddert screamed at them, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>John, you tried to teach our girls to be quiet and obey,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Preston said in court, apparently referring to Mr. Geddert. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We now stand before them and say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Speak.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A. sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University, formally opening an investigation into how the university handled the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, the doctor who sexually assaulted scores of female athletes.Dr. Nassar spent decades on the faculty at the university and treated its athletes, as well as members of the United States national gymnastics team.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has requested information from Michigan State about any potential rules violations,‚<U+0080>ù Donald M. Remy, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief legal officer, said in a phone interview Tuesday evening.N.C.A.A. bylaws require colleges to protect the health, safety and well-being of athletes. Among those who have said Dr. Nassar abused them are members of the Michigan State cross country and softball teams. Kathie Klages, the former gymnastics coach who retired last year, has been accused of seeking to cover up allegations against Dr. Nassar, who served as team physician for the university gymnastics and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crew programs.In a statement late Tuesday, the association said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential N.C.A.A. rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State. We will have no further comment at this time.‚<U+0080>ùA Michigan State spokesman said Tuesday night that the university was reviewing the letter before issuing a response.On Wednesday, Michigan State released the N.C.A.A‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter, which was addressed to Athletic Director Mark Hollis and copied to President Lou Anna Simon. Referring to Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>heinous and appalling assaults,‚<U+0080>ù it cited the principle of athlete wellbeing and a by-law that it said pertained to that principle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s heinous crimes of record against more than 150 victims raise serious concerns about institutional practices, student-athlete safety and the institution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions to protect individuals from his behavior.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement Wednesday, Hollis pledged a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>comprehensive response‚<U+0080>ù to the letter and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation. Of college athletes, he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety.‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A., the governing body of intercollegiate athletics, was widely criticized several years ago for its handling of a case involving Penn State University in which Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant football coach, sexually abused young boys. (Sandusky is serving a decades-long prison term.)Less than a year after the Penn State scandal became public in the fall of 2011, an independent investigation commissioned by Penn State, and led by Louis J. Freeh, helped lead to N.C.A.A. sanctions, including a $60 million fine and the vacating of more than 100 wins from the lifetime record of the former head coach Joe Paterno, who died earlier that year. Several of the penalties were later rescinded, and the wins restored.Critics contended that the N.C.A.A. had overstepped its bounds with those penalties. Emails made public because of a lawsuit two years later appeared to show N.C.A.A. officials questioning whether their institution had the authority to issue such penalties on a university, even one where several high-ranking officials later received jail time for their roles in covering up Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse.In one email, an N.C.A.A. official referred to the consent decree between the association and Penn State as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bluff‚<U+0080>ù and urged a settlement because the N.C.A.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chances of proving a violation of its bylaws before a Committee on Infractions might prove difficult.Last year, an N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions demonstrated just how narrow those bylaws can be when it declined to penalize the University of North Carolina over a scandal in which scores of dubious classes were taken disproportionally by football and men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basketball players. Through gritted teeth, the committee said it could not find an N.C.A.A. violation because the classes had been available to all students.The Nassar case has drawn comparisons to the Sandusky case, raising questions about how university officials responded to warning signs about federal crimes being committed on their campus and about whether they tried to protect someone who was considered valuable to the athletics program. The Michigan State University police received a report about Dr. Nassar as early as May 2014, and on Tuesday a former rower at Michigan State said she had received no response to two separate reports of abuse by Nassar.Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon, a former chair of what is now known as the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors, has faced calls for resignation, though the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s board has largely supported her.The Nassar case has been pushed further into the national spotlight over the past week as Judge Rosemarie Aquilina has allowed more than 140 women, and others connected to the case, to speak at a sentencing hearing for Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to multiple sex crimes and has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. On Monday, three leading members of the board of U.S.A. Gymnastics, which also employed Dr. Nassar for years, resigned amid increasing criticism of how they responded to reports of his abuse.Several voices ordinarily critical of the N.C.A.A. have urged the organization to stay away from the allegations against Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are always mindful of the voices around college athletics,‚<U+0080>ù Remy said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and we strive to do the right thing.‚<U+0080>ùAt the N.C.A.A. Convention last week in Indianapolis, Mark Emmert, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, conspicuously did not mention Michigan State in his annual address, even as he alluded to the U.N.C. scandal and the under-the-table payments in men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s college basketball that federal officials revealed last fall. Emmert told members of the news media at the convention that he did not have enough information on what happened at Michigan State to comment on it in-depth.However, in his address Emmert rebutted the notion that the N.C.A.A. should steer clear of controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dance around those things,‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to various scandals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t make excuses for it. We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say our process is slow.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do we respond? I think, first of all, by not retreating from it, not getting under our desks not hiding from it.‚<U+0080>ùLANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Armed with pieces of paper etched with their memories of sexual abuse, they stepped forward, one by one ‚<U+0080><U+0094> nearly 100 of them, with more to come.For four full days this week, in a fluorescent-lighted courtroom here, women and girls ‚<U+0080><U+0094> some of them the best gymnasts in the country, others with dreams prematurely crushed, they said, by a man who now sat in handcuffs 10 feet away ‚<U+0080><U+0094> leaned into a microphone to address him, sometimes through sobs, sometimes with screams, but always with determination.Aly Raisman, 23, who won gold medals at the past two Summer Olympics, told of late-night knocks on her hotel door while she was competing overseas, as the man, Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, then the team doctor, arrived to abuse her.A teammate at the 2012 London Games, Jordyn Wieber, who until Friday had not identified herself as a victim of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, recalled the torment of the Games, where she was a part of the American team that won a gold medal but, she said, had to submit to his care under the auspices of the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s governing body, U.S.A. Gymnastics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our bodies were all hanging by a thread in London,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Who was the doctor that U.S.A.G. sent? The doctor who was our abuser.‚<U+0080>ùFor other young athletes just striking out, there seemed little they could do but give in, buckling under the pressure of knowing so many stars had seemingly benefited from him. And so a young gymnast named Chelsea Zerfas, now 15, spoke of anguished probing, under the guise of treatment, face down on an exam room table when she was 13, feeling helpless to challenge a doctor at that age.The occasion of the hearing, to help a judge decide Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prospective sentence on state charges of nearly a dozen sexual assaults, appeared almost beside the point. He had been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on a child pornography conviction, and the judge in this state court hearing has said that Dr. Nassar, 54, who has pleaded guilty to several sexual-assault charges, can expect to spend the rest of his life in prison.But before then, she allowed so-called victim impact statements from the 140 girls and women whom prosecutors accuse Dr. Nassar of abusing, leading to days of wrenching testimony here that has evolved into not only a nationally televised reckoning of his crimes but an indictment of a sport that his victims say did little to protect them.At the same time, the hearing has dovetailed with the continued expansion of the #MeToo movement that seeks to hold predatory men to account ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in this case, in excruciating detail.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Come hell or high water, we will find a way to take every last one of you down that could have stopped this monster,‚<U+0080>ù said Amy Labadie, a former gymnast who testified Friday morning. She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to see into the future and not think this will affect me forever.‚<U+0080>ùSome of the victims described how the team doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions spawned suicidal thoughts and ruptured their families, how they hoped he would rot in prison, and how they desperately wanted the blame and repercussions to extend far beyond him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to the people and the organizations that turned a blind eye.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Imagine feeling like you have no power and no voice,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman said Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, you know what, Larry? I have both power and voice, and I am only just beginning to use them. All these brave women have power, and we will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: a life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault, and his sentencing hearing, which began Tuesday, is now expected to continue next week, as the number of women who have wanted to speak in court has grown, from 88 to 105 to 120, at last count ‚<U+0080><U+0094> emboldened by what has happened here this week. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she had cleared her docket.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are all superheroes,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said Friday morning after one of the victims, choking back tears, read her statement.Dr. Nassar entered the courtroom at 9:04 a.m. He wore a dark blue prison uniform. After he reached the witness box, where he has sat with a hangdog expression since the hearing began, he appeared to recognize that Ms. Raisman and Ms. Wieber were seated together in the front row. Dr. Nassar looked down and slowly shook his head.Ms. Wieber, 22, was the first person to testify on Friday ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but the 69th to have her statement heard since the proceedings began. Ms. Wieber said Dr. Nassar began treating her when she was 8. Like many of those who came before her, Ms. Wieber said that Dr. Nassar had manipulated her by bringing her food and coffee at pressure-cooker training camps where such luxuries were prohibited.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody was protecting us from being taken advantage of,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Wieber said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody was ever concerned whether or not we were being sexually abused.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman took clear aim at both U.S.A. Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee when she appeared in court on Friday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Neither U.S.A. Gymnastics nor the U.S.O.C. have reached out to express sympathy or even offer support,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not even to ask: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>How did this happen? What do you think we can do to help?‚<U+0080><U+0099> Why have I and others here, probably, not heard anything from the leadership at the U.S.O.C.? Why has the United States Olympic Committee been silent? Why isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the U.S.O.C. here right now?‚<U+0080>ùMark Jones, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said in a statement that it first became aware of the possibility that a physician with the gymnastics federation had been abusing athletes in 2015.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At that time, U.S.A. Gymnastics indicated that they were in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement agencies,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are heartbroken that this abuse occurred, proud of the brave victims that have come forward and grateful that our criminal justice system has ensured that Nassar will never be able to harm another young woman.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Mr. Jones said, the Olympic committee will continue to press for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>meaningful change‚<U+0080>ù in the gymnastics federation.The federation announced on Thursday that it would cut ties with Karolyi Ranch, a renowned training facility that was one of the places where Dr. Nassar molested the gymnasts.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The development camp taking place through Sunday is the last U.S.A. Gymnastics activity at the Ranch,‚<U+0080>ù the federation said in a statement on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Next week‚<U+0080><U+0099>s training camp for the U.S. women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team is canceled and the Acro World Team Trials scheduled for the first week in February has been relocated.‚<U+0080>ùKara Johnson, now a high school student, spoke about how she was taken to Dr. Nassar for back and hip treatment when she was a 13-year-old runner. Dr. Nassar, she said, placed her on a table on her stomach and then molested her. She described how he left the room, returned with a lubricant and repeated the abuse. He then smacked her on her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bare butt,‚<U+0080>ù called her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sweetie‚<U+0080>ù and told her that if she ever had her period when she came to see him, to be sure to let him know, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>How was I supposed to know at the age of 13 what was medically acceptable and what the boundaries were?‚<U+0080>ù she said.Her sister Madeline was also abused. Now 15, she told the court that as a 12-year-old gymnast, she was sent to Dr. Nassar for back treatment and underwent the same abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At only 12 years old, I had no idea that it was inappropriate, illegal and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she said.On Thursday, McKayla Maroney, 22, another Olympic gymnast, said she had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>scars‚<U+0080>ù that might never heal after being abused by Dr. Nassar, starting when she was 13 or 14.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dr. Nassar was not a doctor,‚<U+0080>ù she said in a statement read for her by a prosecutor. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. End of story.‚<U+0080>ùThe impact of the trial, and Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history of assault, is spreading well beyond the courtroom. Michigan State University, which employed Dr. Nassar, was also facing increasing pressure after revelations that 14 people, including the president, Lou Anna K. Simon, had been warned about his conduct.Ms. Raisman added that she had not been planning to speak in court ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was scared and nervous,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but decided to add her name to the list once she began listening to the impact statements that were delivered earlier this week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My dream,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is that one day everyone will know what the words ‚<U+0080><U+0098>me, too‚<U+0080><U+0099> signify, but they will be educated and able to protect themselves from predators like Larry so that they will never, ever, ever have to say the words, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>me, too.‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ùThe room filled with applause as Ms. Raisman thanked the judge and backed away from the microphone. More women were waiting their turn.Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s third-highest-ranking official, arrived at a Melbourne court on Monday for the start of several weeks of hearings to determine whether he will face trial on charges of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ùPolice officers lined the sidewalk, as a large contingent of the local and international journalists and members of the public watched the cardinal enter the Melbourne Magistrates‚<U+0080><U+0099> Court.The slow-moving case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> charges were filed in June ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will be a test of both Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s justice system and the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to hold clerics accountable after decades of abuse scandals. Witness testimony began on Monday and is expected to continue for two weeks, during which time the court will be closed to the news media and the public.Here is a guide to what we know, what we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and how the case will be shaped by Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s court system.The son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Melbourne Response,‚<U+0080>ù a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell appeared in court on Monday wearing a black suit and clerical collar and did not speak during the initial session.Read:  How Cardinal Pell Rose to Power, Trailed by a Cloud of ScandalRead:  George Pell, Aide to Pope, Is Put on Defensive in Abuse InquiryCardinal Pell has been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ù No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and ‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses. However, nothing has been made public about the details ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not the number of accusers, not the time frame of the accusations, nor the severity of the acts at the center of the case.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said at a news conference in Rome last June.During Monday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hearing, the prosecution requested amendments to certain charges and requested that emotional support dogs be available to witnesses who testified via video link.Read: Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual AssaultRead: Vatican Sex Abuse Scandal Reveals Blind Spot for Francis Expected to run for four weeks, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committal hearing will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to trial.All relevant evidence will be presented to the magistrate by the prosecution, including witness testimony.Local news outlets have reported that up to 50 witnesses could be called during the hearing process. The court heard last year that some of the witnesses were choir boys at the time of the alleged incidents.All witnesses can be subject to cross-examination by the defense ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a noteworthy detail because Robert Richter, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, has a reputation for a withering and aggressive approach.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to demonstrate that what was alleged was impossible,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Richter told the court last October.Even if the magistrate decides that there is not sufficient evidence to proceed, Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.The hearing‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proceedings are largely conducted outside of public view. Reporters are being granted access for the first day of the hearing but will not be allowed to return to cover actual testimony.Read:  Cardinal George Pell Returns to Australia, Charged With Sexual OffensesAustralian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.The country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s contempt standards prohibit reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after charges have been filed and before a verdict has been reached ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that might be seen as prejudicial against or for a defendant.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information on a wide range of topics including: specific accusations against an individual, prior convictions and affiliations with convicted criminals, and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case.All news media organizations in Australia are subject to this restriction, which has the potential to create vast differences in articles about the case published from inside or outside Australia.Suppression orders are also used in many cases to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even the existence of a suppression order can be banned from publication, meaning that journalists cannot report precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage. These are sometimes referred to as superinjunctions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quite often, orders will be made to protect the fairness of the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial,‚<U+0080>ù said Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, whose research has focused on court proceedings. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the main purpose of an order.‚<U+0080>ùBut, he added, such orders are often approved without rigorous scrutiny about whether they are in fact necessary.In a report published before Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case began, Mr. Bosland wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Open justice is increasingly being undermined in Victoria due to the inappropriate use of suppression orders by the courts.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem in Australia is that the courts tend to make orders that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t comply with the strict requirements of the law.‚<U+0080>ùRead:  Suppression Orders Vs. Open JusticeCORYDON, Ind. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A southern Indiana elementary school teacher faces three dozen counts of child molestation that occurred over a three-year period, authorities said Monday.A not-guilty plea was entered on behalf of Corey Faith, 40, during an initial hearing in Harrison Superior Court. The Corydon man was being held at the Harrison County Jail on a $250,000 cash-only bond.Faith admitted the incidents of molestation occurred from 2005 to 2007 in his home, his classroom at New Middletown Elementary School in Corydon and elsewhere, Harrison County Prosecutor Otto Schalk said.A probable cause affidavit said the alleged victim was 12 years old when the molestations began. She had been a student of Faith's when he taught sixth grade. He most recently taught third grade.Court records said the investigation began March 19 when the Harrison County Sheriff's Department received a tip from a friend of the alleged victim after she spoke of multiple sexual encounters with Faith when she was under 14 years old.The South Harrison Community School Corp. delivered notice Monday of its intent to fire Faith. It issued a statement saying it was ""deeply saddened to learn of the events and critical lapses"" in judgment by Faith that occurred.Online court records didn't list an attorney for Faith.The team doctor accused of molesting scores of young athletes while working with the United States gymnastics team and Michigan State University pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault on Wednesday in Ingham County (Mich.) Circuit Court. He is expected to face at least 25 years in prison.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, 54, was charged with the molestation of seven girls, most of whom were gymnasts, but he has been accused of various levels of inappropriate or abusive sexual behavior by a group of more than 130 women and girls, including the Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas.Sentencing is set for Jan. 12. The victims will have an opportunity to speak.In a brief statement on Wednesday, Dr. Nassar said he made the plea ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to move the community forward and stop the hurting.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I pray every day for forgiveness,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You used your position of trust in the most vile way: to abuse children. I agree that now is a time of healing, but it may take them a lifetime of healing while you spend your life behind bars thinking of what you did by taking away their childhood.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The agreement which was placed on the record today was reached after extensive negotiations with the prosecution and with significant input from Larry Nassar. This agreement resolves all the charged and uncharged conduct for more than 125 cases currently under investigation by the Michigan Attorney General‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office.‚<U+0080>ùDuring the hearing Ms. Raisman sent out a Twitter message describing Dr. Nassar as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>monster.‚<U+0080>ùThe girls involved in this specific plea agreement testified that Dr. Nassar molested them, sometimes with their parents present, while they were seeking treatment for sports-related injuries. Complaints against Dr. Nassar reportedly go back 20 years, but USA gymnastics fired him in 2015, which is when the organization claims to have been made aware of the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He convinced these girls that this was some type of legitimate treatment,‚<U+0080>ù Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis told a judge last summer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why would they question him? Why would they question this gymnastics god?‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman, who was the captain of the teams that took home gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, has been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most vocal public critics, and has fiercely argued that the victims of the case should be blameless, despite some criticism they have received for waiting extended periods of time before reporting the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù she said in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes‚<U+0080>ù this month. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùAfter Ms. Raisman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement, and her subsequent commentary, Ms. Douglas, who had competed alongside her in both Olympics, posted a tweet that quoted a message from Ms. Raisman about the abuse. Ms. Douglas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s post included her own comment, which read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>however it is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd.‚<U+0080>ùThe comment was widely attacked as victim shaming, with Simone Biles, the 2016 all-around gold medalist, showing her disappointment in a post to Twitter in which she said it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shocks me that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m seeing this but it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t surprise me.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Douglas has attempted to walk back the post, saying it was misinterpreted and that victims are always blameless. In her clarifications she revealed that she, too, had been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.Ms. Maroney was the first of the gold medal-winning gymnasts to publicly accuse Dr. Nassar when she revealed details of her abuse in October, and Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist from the 2000 team, was among the initial group of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers last year.While Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal situation appears to be resolved in Ingham County, he faces similar charges in Eaton County, the location of an elite gymnastics club. He is also awaiting sentencing after having pleaded guilty in federal court on child pornography charges.On a flight from Seattle to San Jose, Calif., on Monday, a woman caught a glimpse of some text messages that alarmed her.A man seated in front of her on the Southwest Airlines flight was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>texting about sexually molesting young children,‚<U+0080>ù  the San Jose Police Department said in a news release.The man, identified by police as Michael Kellar, 56, of Tacoma, Wash., was using a large smartphone with enlarged text, making it easier for her to read his messages and take photographs of them.The woman alerted a member of the flight crew, who notified police officers working in the Mineta San Jose International Airport. Mr. Kellar was arrested after the plane landed.The woman is a preschool teacher, said Detective Sgt. Brian Spears, commander of the San Jose Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely a hero in our eyes,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Kellar was charged with attempted child molestation and solicitation of a sex crime, both felonies. He was arraigned on Thursday and was being held without bail at the Santa Clara County Jail.Police named Gail Burnworth, 50, also a resident of Tacoma, as the person Mr. Kellar was suspected of texting. They have also located two children, ages 5 and 7, who may have been victims of sexual abuse.Sergeant Spears said the text messages ‚<U+0080><U+009C>described specific sex acts performed on children, as well as bestiality.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It definitely goes beyond just that flight,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a history of conversations between them.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to a statement from the city of Seattle on Wednesday, it seems that Ms. Burnworth ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had access to the children either as a caregiver or babysitter.‚<U+0080>ù She was arrested in Tacoma on Monday but was released after prosecutors did not formally charge her within 72 hours.She was arrested again on Friday night on a federal warrant for conspiracy to produce child pornography.Southwest Airlines did not provide access to the crew member who alerted police because of the criminal investigation. In an emailed statement, it said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We always encourage customers to say something to our employees or law enforcement if they see something suspicious.‚<U+0080>ùThe authorities in California and Washington said federal charges are likely, and the F.B.I. was involved in the continuing investigation.Capt. Mike Edwards, commander of the Seattle Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said the two children who may have been victims remained at their home with their parents.Police did not identify the teacher who reported the text messages. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re very grateful that she was on that plane,‚<U+0080>ù Captain Edwards said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the big message and the big takeaway on this is, for all of us, is to pay attention to what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going on around you,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You never know how important it could be.‚<U+0080>ùHARRISBURG, Pa. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A judge on Friday sentenced three former Pennsylvania State University officials, including a former president, to short jail terms followed by home confinement for their roles in the child molestation scandal that rocked the university.In March, a jury found Graham B. Spanier, the former president, guilty of one misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a child, and not guilty of two other charges. His lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction, and they argued for a sentence of probation rather than jail time.The officials were charged for failing to go to law enforcement after being told in 2001 that a former assistant football coach, Jerry Sandusky, had been seen molesting a boy in a locker room shower. The officials denied that they were told at the time that the episode in the shower was overtly sexual.Mr. Sandusky went on to assault several other minors, and in 2012, he was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.It is very rare for prosecutors to try to hold university leaders criminally liable for the misconduct of others, and the case is all the more remarkable for involving one of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most prominent universities, and one of its most vaunted football programs.It has been a stunning downfall for Mr. Spanier, 68, who had spoken publicly about his own history of being abused as a child by his father, who beat him severely. He served for 16 years as president of Penn State, until he was forced out in 2011, and had earned a reputation as a skilled, energetic administrator who sometimes went too far in stifling criticism of the university.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The single most important thing I can say is that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080>ù he told the court on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that I did not intervene far more carefully.‚<U+0080>ùIn handing down the sentence in Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, Judge John Boccabella said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a Shakespearean tragedy; this is a fall from grace that is both unfortunate and well deserved.‚<U+0080>ùThe defendants are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good people who made a terrible mistake,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why no one made a phone call to police is beyond me.‚<U+0080>ùLaura Ditka, the deputy state attorney general who was the lead prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Spanier had chosen to protect his and Penn State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputations, rather than protect children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is inexcusable,‚<U+0080>ù she said.The case also badly damaged the reputation of Joe Paterno, the revered head football coach, who was accused of knowing about allegations against Mr. Sandusky. He was fired in 2011, after 45 years, and died a few months later.The university has paid tens of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits filed by Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, and the total could eventually exceed $100 million. Mr. Spanier has also sued the university.Gary Schultz, formerly a senior vice president of the university, and Tim Curley, a former athletic director, were charged along with Mr. Spanier. They pleaded guilty to related charges and testified at the trial of Mr. Spanier, who refused a plea deal.Mr. Spanier‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers had argued that he should not get jail time, in part because of health problems. Prosecutors said he should receive a penalty in the upper part of the allowable range for the conviction, which carries a maximum sentence of one year.Judge Boccabella sentenced Mr. Spanier to four to 12 months‚<U+0080><U+0099> confinement, with at least two months of that in jail followed by home confinement, and a $7,500 fine. He sentenced Mr. Curley to seven to 23 months, with at least three months in jail, and a $5,000 fine; and Mr. Schultz to six to 23 months, with at least two months in jail, and a $5,000 fine. In addition, he imposed two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> probation on all three men.The judge said he was not convinced that Mr. Spanier was as culpable as the other two.Mr. Spanier, who arrived at the courthouse holding hands with his wife, Sandra, remained impassive throughout, and he and his lawyers declined to answer questions as they left. But Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz made emotional appeals for leniency before the sentences were handed down.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sickens me to think that I might have played a part in children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s suffering,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schultz said.A founder of the now-disbanded Minuteman border patrol group has been convicted in Arizona of molesting a 5-year-old girl, bringing to an end a case that gained the attention of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s highest court after he tried to cross-examine the young victim.The defendant, Christopher Simcox, 55, was found guilty Wednesday of molesting the girl, who was a friend of his 6-year-old daughter, between April 21, 2012, and May 23, 2013, during visits to his apartment,  the Maricopa County attorney, Bill Montgomery, said in a statement. Mr. Simcox was in the process of divorcing his wife at the time.The girl told her mother of the abuse, and her mother called law enforcement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The defendant preyed upon a young child while she was meant to be in his care,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This young girl had the courage to come forward to stop the abuse and by doing so revealed his predatory behavior. With this verdict, we have been able to seek justice for this victim.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Simcox was found guilty of two counts of molestation of a child and one count of furnishing obscene materials to a minor, the statement said. He was also accused of sexual conduct with another child, but was found not guilty of that charge, Mr. Montgomery said.Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial took an unexpected turn that could have an impact on future case law. Although he is not a lawyer, Mr. Simcox represented himself and sought to question the girls he was accused of molesting.But prosecutors brought in an expert to address the trauma it would cause the victims, and they took action in lower courts to block Mr. Simcox, eventually filing a petition that is now before the United States Supreme Court.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ultimately, the defendant backed down from his insistence on personally carrying out the cross-examination of his victims and allowed his advisory attorney to question the victims,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though the issue is now moot in this case, it is still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court because of its legal significance.‚<U+0080>ùKerrie Droban, who served as Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advisory counsel, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that she had questioned the girls instead, while Mr. Simcox was allowed during the trial to question two children who were witnesses.Mr. Simcox will be sentenced on July 5. Consecutive mandatory sentences could be tantamount to a life in prison, Ms. Droban said.Mr. Simcox was a former high-profile advocate for tougher control of borders and undocumented day laborers, joining watch groups and speaking out at public events, like one in Farmingville on Long Island in 2003.He was a founder of a volunteer armed watch group, Civil Homeland Defense, which was created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and intercepted undocumented immigrants crossing into Arizona, turning them over to the authorities. Later, he helped form the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, which stepped into the national spotlight in 2005 with high-profile border patrols.The Southern Poverty Law Center said Mr. Simcox, a former kindergarten teacher, was among the movement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most charismatic figures, affecting the likeness of a vigilante with a pistol tucked into the front of his jeans.In 2012, Mr. Simcox told the center, which was investigating the possible involvement of extremist groups in the killings of Mexicans crossing the Arizona border, that he had left the movement and was living a quiet life tutoring schoolchildren in suburban Phoenix.When the verdict in his trial was announced on Wednesday, the mother of the then-5-year-old girl dabbed her eyes with tissue, The Arizona Republic reported.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was convicted on at least one, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s all we need,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This conviction is for all of the children that he hurt.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have words,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s over. I can go home and tell my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùHARRISBURG, Pa. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The agency that investigates and prosecutes wrongdoing by Pennsylvania lawyers wants the state Supreme Court to punish Penn State's former general counsel and a prosecutor who helped convict Jerry Sandusky of child molestation related to their involvement with the 2012 grand jury investigation.The state Office of Disciplinary Counsel has lodged petitions for discipline against Cynthia Baldwin, a former state Supreme Court justice who was the university's general counsel when the scandal broke, and Frank Fina, who helped direct the investigation and lead the prosecution of Sandusky by the attorney general's office.The allegations against the two recently became public. Baldwin has a hearing scheduled for May.Fina is accused of turning Baldwin ""into a witness for the prosecution"" when Baldwin testified in secret in October 2012 about three former high-ranking university administrators who fielded complaints about Sandusky abusing children ‚<U+0080><U+0094> president Graham Spanier, vice president Gary Schultz and athletic director Tim Curley.Disciplinary Counsel Amelia C. Kittredge wrote in the 41-page petition for discipline filed in January that Fina's questioning ""went far beyond, and impermissibly beyond, the topics (he) told Judge (Barry) Feudale he would cover.""Days after Baldwin's testimony, prosecutors added conspiracy to commit perjury and conspiracy to commit obstruction charges against Curley and Schultz and for the first time charged Spanier, accusing him of the same offenses. Superior Court in January 2016 threw out charges against all three men that related to false statements to the grand jury, saying Fina had misled the judge and calling his questioning of Baldwin ""highly improper.""Fina's lawyers call the claims against their client ""unprecedented and disturbing,"" and said sealed records from the criminal case ""fully exonerate"" him. Fina, now a lawyer in private practice, denies violating any rule of conduct and wants the petition dismissed.Curley and Schultz pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment on the eve of trial in March 2017 and testified against Spanier. Spanier was convicted of the same offense and has an appeal pending in Superior Court. Lawyers for all three men declined to comment on the lawyer discipline allegations against Fina and Baldwin.Superior Court, in throwing out charges, said it was improper that Baldwin, a former trial judge and onetime chair of the Penn State board, testified about her conversations with Curley, Schultz and Spanier.Joe Grace, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said it questioned Baldwin ""with the knowledge and approval of the judge assigned to supervise the grand jury.""""The matter was also addressed by the judge assigned to the criminal case, who rejected any claims of impropriety,"" he added. ""The Office of Attorney General remains fully prepared to defend its successful prosecutions and convictions in this matter.""The petition filed against Baldwin on Nov. 21 accuses her of violating requirements that lawyers do not disclose information about clients without their informed consent and other allegations.Baldwin had accompanied Curley, Schultz and Spanier when they appeared before the grand jury in 2011, months before child sexual abuse charges were filed against Sandusky and cover-up charges were filed against Curley and Schultz. In her answer to the petition for discipline, she said she thought they were witnesses only, not suspected of a crime, and that she represented the university.She denies violating the state's ethical rules for lawyers and has asked that the allegations be dismissed.""The allegations against Ms. Baldwin are based upon the conduct of Mr. Curley, Mr. Schultz and Dr. Spanier, who participated in a conspiracy to cover up their knowledge of Mr. Sandusky's conduct and who tried to blame Ms. Baldwin when their conspiracy came to light,"" wrote her lawyer, Robert S. Tintner. He said the original complaint about her to the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court was filed in June 2012, at the time of Sandusky's trial.Tintner said the sealed documents show she ""acted in a manner consistent with her ethical obligations.""Sandusky, Penn State's former assistant football coach, was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving a 30- to 60-year prison sentence. Al Lindsay, Sandusky's appellate defense attorney said the disciplinary board cases will not directly affect Sandusky's effort to get a new trial, but Lindsay believes the grand jury investigation was badly flawed and welcomes any effort to review how it unfolded.For more than a year, an F.B.I. inquiry into allegations that Lawrence G. Nassar, a respected sports doctor, had molested three elite teenage gymnasts followed a plodding pace as it moved back and forth among agents in three cities. The accumulating information included instructional videos of the doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unusual treatment methods, showing his ungloved hands working about the private areas of girls lying facedown on tables.But as the inquiry moved with little evident urgency, a cost was being paid. The New York Times has identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he first fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by an Indianapolis Star investigation. Some are among the youngest of the now-convicted predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s many accusers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 265, and counting.The three alleged victims then at the center of the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inquiry were world-class athletes; two were Olympic gold medalists. Nearly a year passed before agents interviewed two of the young women.The silence at times drove the victims and their families to distraction, including Gina Nichols, the mother of the gymnast initially known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Athlete A‚<U+0080>ù: Maggie Nichols, who was not contacted by the F.B.I. for nearly 11 months after the information she provided sparked the federal inquiry.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never got a phone call from the police or the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ù during that time, Gina Nichols, a registered nurse, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not one person. Not one. Not one. Not one.‚<U+0080>ùThe F.B.I. declined to answer detailed questions about the speed and nature of its investigation, or to provide an official who might put the case in context. Instead, it issued a 112-word statement asserting that the sexual exploitation of children ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is an especially heinous crime,‚<U+0080>ù and that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the safety and well-being of our youth is a top priority for the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also said that the many allegations against Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+009C>transcended jurisdictions‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an apparent suggestion that internal efforts to coordinate among its bureaus and with other law enforcement agencies partly explained the inquiry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s slow tempo.The agency left unaddressed the oft-repeated claim by U.S.A. Gymnastics officials that after initially presenting the sexual assault allegations to the F.B.I. in July 2015, they came away with the impression that federal agents had advised them not to discuss the case with anyone. The ensuing silence had dire consequences, as the many girls and young women still seeing Dr. Nassar received no warning.Among them was Emma Ann Miller.By the summer of 2015, Emma Ann, the only child of a single mother, was both a competitive dancer and just another Michigan kid immersed in the joys and dramas of middle school life. She got braces, with baby blue rubber bands that matched her eyes. She began receiving Snapchat attention from boys.And once a month, she went to Suite 420 in a six-story office building close to Michigan State University in East Lansing, where her solicitous doctor, who encouraged everyone to just call him Larry, molested her.According to her lawyer, Emma Ann had about a dozen sessions with Dr. Nassar between the summers of 2015 and 2016. The pain of the procedures increased, and her self-confidence plummeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whenever he asked if my lower back hurt, he would always find a way to touch me down there,‚<U+0080>ù she said, explaining that Dr. Nassar would say that her pelvis was in need of adjustment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whether or not I said my back hurt, he would always find a way to, to. ‚<U+0080>¶‚<U+0080>ùThe young girl paused.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve blocked out a lot of what he did to me,‚<U+0080>ù she said finally.Only three years ago, Dr. Nassar was a popular doctor among the athletes he treated for U.S.A. Gymnastics, known for being goofy but maybe a bit too attentive. His treatments, which gymnastics officials believed were at the cutting edge, were also in demand at Michigan State, where he worked, as well as at Holt High School, and at a gymnastics academy called Twistars.Issues had cropped up: a parent raising concerns about his behavior at Twistars; a female athlete or two at Michigan State complaining to no avail about inappropriate exams. In 2014, a university investigation of another complaint cleared Dr. Nassar of misconduct, but he was now required to have a third person present when treatment involved sensitive areas of the body ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and to wear gloves.Still, the doctor was trusted enough to conduct his procedures ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intravaginal adjustment‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> without supervision when treating the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s best gymnasts at the Karolyi ranch, the exclusive and secluded national team training camp, about 60 miles north of Houston. Gymnasts of international caliber, like Ms. Nichols, of suburban Minneapolis, would spend a week each month at the ranch, under the exacting supervision of the revered coach Martha Karolyi.But at the ranch in late spring of 2015, Ms. Nichols‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal coach, Sarah Jantzi, overheard the 17-year-old girl talking with another elite gymnast, Aly Raisman, about Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s invasive and inappropriate techniques. The alarming information was quickly shared with the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents and, by June 17, with officials at U.S.A. Gymnastics.Gina Nichols, Maggie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, recalled telling Steve Penny, then the president of U.S.A. Gymnastics, that the police had to be called immediately. But he insisted that she not tell anyone, she said. The organization would take care of alerting law enforcement.Weeks of silence passed, Gina Nichols said, interrupted occasionally by admonitions from Mr. Penny to keep quiet about the matter ‚<U+0080><U+0094> although the United States Olympic Committee has said that U.S.A. Gymnastics reported that one of its physicians had been accused of abusing athletes ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and was in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement authorities.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics eventually retained what it called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an experienced female investigator‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a specialist in workplace harassment. After completing her interviews, the investigator recommended on Friday, July 24, that Dr. Nassar be reported to law enforcement.Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman competed the next day at the U.S. Classic in Chicago. Gina Nichols said that she saw Mr. Penny at the event and that he told her: We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re working on this. Keep it quiet.On Monday, July 27, gymnastics officials contacted the F.B.I. in Indianapolis, where U.S.A. Gymnastics has its headquarters. The next day, its chairman, Paul Parilla, and its president, Mr. Penny, met with F.B.I. agents who, they later said, assured them they had come to the right place. Forty-one days had passed since U.S.A. Gymnastics first received the report of the sexual abuse of one of its charges.At this moment, F.B.I. agents in Indianapolis were also immersed in the child-exploitation case of Jared Fogle, the longtime pitchman on Subway television ads. Mr. Fogle was arrested that summer on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child and distribution of child pornography, and later sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison.The gymnastics officials provided the agents with contact information for three gymnasts: Ms. Nichols, Ms. Raisman and someone emerging as the central complainant: McKayla Maroney, then 19, a retired Olympic gold medalist who by the summer of 2015 had become a minor celebrity, struggling in public to find her next purpose in life ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a struggle she has since indicated was related to serious emotional issues stemming from the abuse.They also turned over copies of videos of Dr. Nassar demonstrating his technique as he chatted clinically about pulled hamstrings, buttocks and trigger points. Reporters for The New York Times have seen the videos, which show him kneading the legs of girls before his ungloved hands begin to work under a towel, between the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> legs.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not a fun place to dig,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar says to the camera.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do the hand-shaky thing,‚<U+0080>ù he adds later, demonstrating how he shakes his hand vigorously when it is deep between a girl‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legs.W. Jay Abbott, who at the time was the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. bureau in Indianapolis, said on Thursday that while he did not watch the videos, he vividly remembered the reactions of colleagues who had.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will never forget sitting around the table and thinking, What?‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Abbott, who retired in January. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the reaction of my special agents who were very well versed in this was one of disgust. That is why we worked it with such urgency.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At the time, it was being portrayed as a legitimate medical procedure. But to the layman, like ourselves, we were ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to be kidding me.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe next day, U.S.A. Gymnastics quietly, even surreptitiously, relieved Dr. Nassar of any further assignments. It later issued a statement saying: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>U.S.A. Gymnastics understood from its meeting with the F.B.I. that it should not take any action nor communicate anything that might interfere with the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation.‚<U+0080>ùAll the while, Dr. Nassar continued his uncommon treatment techniques on young patients.Emma Ann Miller remembers the summer of 2015 as her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>best summer ever.‚<U+0080>ùShe competed in a dance competition in Las Vegas, where she performed to a song from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Legally Blonde,‚<U+0080>ù and won a trophy that was two and a half feet tall ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about half her height. She spent time at a sleep-away Bible camp, where she went kayaking, horseback riding and zip-lining, and had water balloon fights.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We T.P.‚<U+0080><U+0099>ed the boys‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabin down the hill and had a Silly String fight with two of the other girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said with a laugh. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone threw a frog into one of the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins. It was so much fun.‚<U+0080>ùBut then there were those monthly visits to the office of Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+0094> doctor to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all of these super-high-up Olympians‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who had treated her mother for years for injuries related to a car accident. Given that Emma Ann had known him her entire life, he was almost like family, an intimacy reflected in the half-dozen photographs of her that he displayed in his treatment room.Dr. Nassar first molested her when she was 10, she recalled. She remembered the pants she was wearing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> black leggings with white flowers, from A√©ropostale. She was having back and neck issues, and he had her remove the leggings and put on loose shorts. In a medical supply room that doubled as a treatment room, he began exploring ‚<U+0080><U+009C>down there.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Is this O.K.?‚<U+0080><U+0099> and I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And he was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Just hang in there.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how it felt. I just knew that it hurt.‚<U+0080>ùIn the summer of 2015, the treatments hurt even more. She had tried wearing three pairs of underpants or especially tight shorts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> anything to keep Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fingers from probing her. Now that she was older, she began lying that she was having her period.At some point, Emma Ann told her mother that she preferred not to be alone with Dr. Nassar. That did not end it. She said he continued to abuse her while positioning himself so that her mother couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t see what he was doing. He would grope the girl beneath a white towel meant to convey propriety, all the while chatting with her mother, a kindergarten teacher.How‚<U+0080><U+0099>s your class going?‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew that he had helped my mom, so I had to persuade myself into thinking that he also helped me,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really sure.‚<U+0080>ùEmma Ann now knows that she was not alone. The growing number of other girls who say they were being molested between the summers of 2015 and 2016 includes Alexis Alvarado, 19, who began seeing Dr. Nassar in 2010 for a stress fracture in her back. He began that treatment by massaging her legs, but then his hands crept up until, she said, his fingers were inside her. She was 12.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize what he was doing was wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Alvarado said. But she explained that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thought everything could be fixed through the butt.‚<U+0080>ù That is why her gymnastics teammates in Lansing, Mich., called him the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>butt doctor.‚<U+0080>ùThe monthly appointments continued through the summer of 2015 and into the next year. So did her shame, and dread.The same was true for Hannah Morrow, of Naperville, Ill., who will turn 18 on Tuesday. Several times a year, starting when she was 11 or 12, she took the four-hour car ride to see Dr. Nassar, looping around the bottom coast of Lake Michigan. At some point, she started listening to playlists she compiled to help keep her mind off what was about to be done to her.She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d try to get hooked on a new song to sing in her head, over and over. Her favorite, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I Write Sins Not Tragedies‚<U+0080>ù by Panic! At the Disco, included the line: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.‚<U+0080>ùAs with Emma Ann Miller, Hannah also began wearing tighter pants and underwear that covered more of her buttocks, in the unrealized hope that it would dissuade him. She struggled to reconcile his outsize reputation with what he was doing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If all of those Olympians loved him, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Hannah remembered thinking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though I feel weird with what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s doing, I guess I shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d make excuses: He doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too close to my butt, or that he brushed over my boobs.‚<U+0080>ùIn late July or early August, F.B.I. agents asked Ms. Maroney to travel to Indianapolis from her home in California to discuss the allegation, according to her lawyer, John Manly, but she declined. It is unclear why an agent did not travel to see her in person. As a result, the first substantive interview of an alleged victim in a child-molestation case was conducted by telephone.Meanwhile, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman continued their gymnastics pursuits ‚<U+0080><U+0094> both competed at the P & G Championships in Indianapolis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but they still had received no word from any law enforcement official about the allegations now lodged with the F.B.I.Some of the delay appears to have been related to questions concerning federal-versus-state jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction within the F.B.I. itself. Although the Indianapolis bureau had received the information, the alleged sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar had taken place in Texas, at the Karolyi ranch, and in Michigan, where he lived and worked. And Ms. Maroney lived in California.According to Mr. Abbott, his agents in Indianapolis did not have the case for long. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we consulted with the U.S. attorney, we knew right away that we would not have venue,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was never really our case.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Abbott said that his agents conducted some interviews, but he declined to say with whom. He also said written reports were sent within weeks to F.B.I. offices in Michigan and Los Angeles.The retired agent emphasized how the sensitivities and difficulties of child-exploitation cases can contribute to the length of investigations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are dealing with victims who sometimes don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be interviewed,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is extremely delicate. And you also have the parents of minors who are sometimes not comfortable with interviews.‚<U+0080>ùAsked why federal law enforcement officials did not notify people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> other gymnasts, parents, coaches ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that a potential child molester was in their midst, Mr. Abbott said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s where things can get tricky.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a duty to warn those who might be harmed in the future,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But everyone is still trying to ascertain whether a crime has been committed. And everybody has rights here‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reference to both the alleged victims and the person being accused.The Nassar case might have been further complicated, he said, by the fact that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there was a vigorous debate going on about whether this was a legitimate medical procedure.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics officials said that around this time they were told that pertinent interviews had been completed and that the case had been transferred to another jurisdiction. Indeed, on Sept. 12, Ms. Maroney was directed by U.S.A. Gymnastics to contact the F.B.I. East Lansing office.According to Mr. Manly, the retired gymnast‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Erin Maroney, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>called repeatedly,‚<U+0080>ù but received no follow-up response.Two weeks later, on Sept. 27, Dr. Nassar announced on Facebook that he was retiring from the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team staff, notwithstanding a note he had posted in late June saying he would remain with the team through the summer of 2016.He did not elaborate.In April 2016, Ms. Raisman shared a gold medal with the national team at the Pacific Rim Championships in Seattle, while Ms. Nichols damaged a knee during training, underwent surgery, and was out for several weeks ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reminder of the physical toll of the sport. Meanwhile, neither she nor her parents heard anything about the federal investigation that U.S.A. Gymnastics had instructed them to remain silent about.The Raisman family was similarly frustrated. According to a person close to the family, Ms. Raisman and her mother, Lynn, repeatedly reached out to Mr. Penny to find out about the status of the federal investigation, only to be told that an F.B.I. agent would be getting in touch with them.Finally, the absence of information about the federal investigation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the increasing concern of the victims and their families ‚<U+0080><U+0094> prompted Mr. Penny and Mr. Parilla, the U.S.A. Gymnastics officials, to visit the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Los Angeles bureau in early May. Mr. Parilla lives in Southern California, as does Ms. Maroney, and Mr. Penny stopped in Los Angeles while returning from an overseas trip.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As time passed, concern about a perceived lack of development prompted Board Chair Paul Parilla and C.E.O. Steve Penny to report the matter a second time to a different F.B.I. office,‚<U+0080>ù U.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement to The Times on Friday.Through a lawyer and a spokeswoman, Mr. Parilla and Mr. Penny declined to be interviewed for this article.The visit appears to have jump-started the federal investigation into Dr. Nassar. Agents asked for more information, including a list of the members of the national women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics team. And on May 17, the F.B.I. finally interviewed Ms. Maroney in person.It had been 294 days since the F.B.I. was first notified of accusations against Dr. Nassar.A few weeks later, on June 13, Gina Nichols received an email from Michael Hess, an F.B.I. agent then based in Los Angeles. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am looking into a complaint that was filed involving alleged misconduct by an individual associated with U.S.A. Gymnastics,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When you have a moment, please give me a call at the below numbers.‚<U+0080>ùIt was a stressful time: Her daughter was preparing for the Olympic trials. But several days later, the gymnast went to a suburban Minneapolis building, not far from her home, to meet Mr. Hess, who had flown in from Los Angeles.In addition, a person close to the Raisman family said that the F.B.I. also contacted Ms. Raisman in the summer of 2016. While Mr. Manly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who represents Ms. Raisman, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Maroney ‚<U+0080><U+0094> applauded the diligence of Mr. Hess, he expressed amazement that so little had been done for so long.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given who these women were, all competing for their country, and given that these assaults had occurred in different states and countries, there was an obvious need to have a multilayered, multijurisdictional investigation,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Manly said.Gina Nichols, who had been instructed by U.S.A. Gymnastics not to talk about the matter, recalled that while venting in a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Hess, the agent told her:You can talk to anybody you want.That August, in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Raisman had an Olympics for the ages, demonstrating poise and leadership as she won three medals, including gold. But Ms. Nichols, returning from her knee injury, was ultimately not invited to join the Olympic team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even as an alternate.Meanwhile, Emma Ann Miller continued to keep her treatment appointments with Dr. Nassar. But the abuse had worsened, and she no longer felt like the bubbly teenager she had been only a year before. She stopped taking selfies because she felt ugly and fat. She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d cry if she received an A-minus on a paper or test, thinking it was evidence of her stupidity.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even want to order a drink at Starbucks because I was so scared I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d mess it up,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said.Her mother, Leslie Miller, struggles now with her rage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at what he did to my happy girl,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Miller said, in tears. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at all the people who could‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve stopped him earlier. My goal is to find every single one of them in the haystack ‚<U+0080><U+0094> expose them all, so this will never happen again.‚<U+0080>ùIt was only a matter of time.On Sept. 12, 2016, The Indianapolis Star published an in-depth investigation detailing allegations that Dr. Nassar had repeatedly molested two gymnasts when they were young. One woman had filed a criminal complaint with the police in Michigan. The other, initially described only as an Olympic medalist, had filed a lawsuit against the doctor and U.S.A. Gymnastics in California. Neither was involved in the F.B.I. inquiry.Suddenly, the Nassar case took on urgency. As other girls and women began calling the Michigan State University Police to file complaints, their numbers eventually growing into the dozens, their abuser did what he could to mask his behavior, including throwing hard drives containing more than 37,000 images and videos of child pornography into the trash for pickup in the morning.But trash pickup in his neighborhood was late that day, allowing a police officer to find the horrifying material while executing a search warrant on behalf of the university police.By the close of 2016, Dr. Nassar was in custody. By the close of 2017, he had been convicted of myriad state charges, as well as federal child pornography charges, based in large part on that state search warrant. Given that he has been sentenced to nearly two centuries in prison, Dr. Nassar will likely die there.In recent weeks, a communal catharsis has played out, as dozens and dozens of empowered victims or their proxies have confronted the doctor at sentencing hearings. The angry but resolute words of Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols have echoed in the courtrooms of Michigan.So, too, have the words of the lesser-known accusers, those girls and young women who report they were abused in the year after allegations were first presented to the F.B.I. in Indianapolis: the likes of Alexis Alvarado and Hannah Morrow ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and Emma Ann Miller, who in November turned 15.The American gymnast McKayla Maroney, an Olympic gold medalist, said she was sexually abused by the same team doctor who is already facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Maroney, 21, posted on Twitter early Wednesday morning that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13.Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven other individuals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 125 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and dozens of civil suits filed against him in Michigan are currently in mediation.In her Twitter post, Maroney said Nassar molested team members, including her, under the guise of treating them for medical conditions over several decades. Her claims matched the stories of other gymnasts and former teammates.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treated,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Maroney said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened in London before my team and I won the gold medal, and it happened before I won my silver.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old. I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treatment.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I thought I was going to die that night.‚<U+0080>ùJamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the gymnasts who have accused Nassar. Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward, and many have joined a lawsuit against USA Gymnastics.Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, declined a request to comment on Wednesday.Maroney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusation comes a day after another gold medalist, Tatiana Gutsu of Ukraine, accused a star gymnast of raping her when she was 15. Gutsu won the all-around title at the 1992 Barcelona Games as part of the Unified Team of former Soviet athletes.Maroney said she chose to speak out publicly because of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Me Too‚<U+0080>ù movement in which women post the phrase on social media to show that they, too, have been sexually assaulted or harassed.Maroney was part of the 2012 American gymnastics team that won a team gold medal. She also won an individual silver on her specialty, the vault.She drew extra attention that year for a look of disappointment she displayed on the medal stand after winning her silver. The picture became an internet meme, often labeled, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>McKayla is not impressed,‚<U+0080>ù and President Barack Obama and others emulated her expression.The American gymnast Aly Raisman said that she too had been sexually abused by the team doctor who is facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Ms. Raisman, 23, made the revelation in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes,‚<U+0080>ù excerpts from which were released Friday, and in a book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fierce,‚<U+0080>ù being released next week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am angry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m really upset because I care a lot, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman was captain of the teams that won gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics. Another member of the 2012 team, McKayla Maroney, said last month that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13. Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the other gymnasts who have accused Dr. Nassar.Dr. Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 100 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges.Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward.Dr. Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, said Friday that he did not have a comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman told ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, USA Gymnastics said it had adopted a new policy that requires the reporting of suspicions of sexual abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused, and we are very sorry that any athlete has been harmed during his or her gymnastics career.‚<U+0080>ùThe interview will air in full on Sunday on CBS.In addition to her team gold medals, Ms. Raisman won the 2012 gold medal in floor exercise, as well as two individual silver medals and one bronze in her Olympics career. She also won four world championships medals and numerous national titles.Though she was the oldest gymnast on both the 2012 and 2016 teams, she has spoken of continuing her career and going for the 2020 Games.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, a former team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics who has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing gymnasts under the guise of medical treatment, was sentenced on Thursday to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.The charges, which stemmed from more than 37,000 images of child pornography found on Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer, are separate from the 10 molestation counts on which sentences will be handed down in January. He pleaded guilty to the pornography charges over the summer, and to the molestation charges in November.Dr. Nassar, 54, is expected to be sentenced to 25 years or more on the molestation charges. But even without that, he is virtually certain to spend the rest of his life in prison after Janet T. Neff, a federal district judge in Grand Rapids, Mich., imposed three consecutive 20-year sentences in the child pornography case.Matthew Newburg, a lawyer for Dr. Nassar, declined to comment on Thursday.The case against Dr. Nassar emerged last year, after an Indianapolis Star investigation found that U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national governing body, had systematically failed to report gymnasts‚<U+0080><U+0099> allegations of sexual abuse by coaches. Then, in September 2016, The Star published detailed accounts from two former gymnasts who said that, among other sexually abusive behavior, Dr. Nassar had penetrated them with his fingers, claiming it was a treatment for back pain.Those two gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Rachael Denhollander, who was the first to step forward by name, and Jamie Dantzscher, who initially remained anonymous but later spoke out publicly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> broke a dam of silence in the sport, more than a year before the #MeToo movement began revealing sexual misconduct by innumerable men in powerful positions. More than 130 women ‚<U+0080><U+0094> mostly but not exclusively gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have now described abuse by Dr. Nassar (who worked both for the national team and for Michigan State University). Among them are at least seven former members of the United States national gymnastics team, including four Olympians.Many of the women submitted victim impact statements to the court before the sentencing on Thursday. Judge Neff ruled last week that they could not be read aloud in the courtroom, but some women shared their statements through other channels.McKayla Maroney, a 2012 Olympian who came forward in October as one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, wrote in her statement that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He abused my trust, abused my body and left scars on my psyche that may never heal,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Maroney wrote, according to ESPN.And Aly Raisman ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the captain of the American women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics teams at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and one of the most outspoken survivors of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> published thousands of words in The Players‚<U+0080><U+0099> Tribune on Thursday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I ask that you give Larry the strongest possible sentence (which his actions deserve), for by doing so, you will send a message to him and to other abusers that they cannot get away with their horrible crimes,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman, 23, said in her statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe knowing that Larry is being held accountable for his abuse will help me and the other survivors feel less alone, like we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re being heard, and open up pathways for healing.‚<U+0080>ùBecause of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, Ms. Raisman wrote, she is frequently afraid: afraid that other doctors will treat her similarly; afraid even that a man will deliver her room service order when she travels.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hold the door open as he drops off the food and keep it open until he leaves,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I often wonder if I am hurting their feelings by being so obviously distrusting of them. I always used to give people the benefit of the doubt, but if a decorated doctor who served on the national team for over 30 years turned out to be a monster, then how can I trust anybody?‚<U+0080>ùEven so, she continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am not a victim. I am a survivor. The abuse does not define me, or anyone else who has been abused.‚<U+0080>ùBeyond Dr. Nassar himself, the cases have ensnared U.S.A. Gymnastics and many of its top officials, whom lawsuits have accused of turning a blind eye and of fostering toxic environments in which abuse could flourish. Earlier this year, U.S.A. Gymnastics adopted stricter reporting policies in response to an extensive report on its previous failings.Some gymnasts said it was difficult to feel entirely victorious after the sentencing, because Dr. Nassar was part of a much larger problem.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, the justice feels very incomplete,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said at a news conference on Thursday.NASHVILLE, Tenn. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A longtime pastor has been returned to Tennessee to face charges that he molested several children during his time leading a Nashville congregation.Media reports say Matthew Dennis Patterson was arrested March 8 by Nashville police in Pennsylvania, where he moved after leaving the Tennessee church last September.Patterson was extradited to Nashville on Friday.He served as pastor of Nolensville Road Baptist Church. After his resignation, authorities say church members went to police with complaints about his requests to ""engage in strange activities"" with children.According to a police statement, children told adult church members that Patterson had asked them to sit on his face and stomach, sometimes in their underwear.Patterson has been indicted on eight counts of aggravated sexual battery. Police say each count is linked to a different child.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a child sex abuse scandal that has rocked English soccer, a former youth coach and talent scout who worked for a number of well-known teams was convicted on Tuesday of 36 counts of sexually assaulting boys aged 8 to 15, from 1979 to 1990.The case against the former coach, Barry Bennell, began in late 2016, when Andrew Woodward became the first professional player to say publicly that he had been molested by a coach, accusing Mr. Bennell. But the scandal widened, as other allegations were made against Mr. Bennell, and then against other well-known coaches and scouts, until those stepping forward to say they had been victimized numbered in the hundreds, including dozens of former professionals.Soccer has taken its place among the institutions tarnished by the disclosure of systematic sexual exploitation, including the Roman Catholic Church, the news media and Hollywood. In Britain, the case of Mr. Bennell came after revelations that Jimmy Savile, a longtime host of BBC television shows who died in 2011, had molested dozens of children.From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Mr. Bennell, now 64, worked for several well-known professional teams ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one, Manchester City, that plays in the upper echelon of the game ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as a scout and sometime coach for youth programs. The work gave him access to boys who lived away from their parents at times.Prosecutors said that he equipped his home with video games, exotic animals and fast food to make it attractive to boys, and that he abused them there and in his car.Twice in the 1990s and again in 2015, Mr. Bennell ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has changed his name to Richard Jones ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was convicted of multiple counts of sexually abusing youth players and sent to prison. The latest revelations were surprising less in that additional long-ago victims might be found than in the numbers and prominence of some of them.The jury in Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday found him not guilty of three charges, and they will continue deliberating on seven others.CHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Federal prosecutors on Friday for the first time provided details of sexual abuse allegations against J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, asserting that he molested at least four boys, as young as 14, when he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades ago.Mr. Hastert, 74, is not charged with abuse because of statutes of limitation, prosecutors said, but he was accused last year of illegally structuring bank withdrawals to pay one of his victims in an effort to hide the abuse. He pleaded guilty in October to the banking violation, and suffered a stroke in November while awaiting sentencing, set for April 27.In a court filing late Friday, making suggestions for a judge who will decide Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentence, the prosecutors described specific, graphic incidents that they say occurred when Mr. Hastert was a popular, championship-winning coach in a small Illinois town in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. The ‚<U+0080><U+009C>known acts,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said, consisted of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intentional touching of minors‚<U+0080><U+0099> groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The actions at the core of this case took place not on the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national public stage but in his private one-on-one encounters in an empty locker room and a motel room with minors that violated the special trust between those young boys and their coach,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors wrote.A lawyer for Mr. Hastert did not reply to a request for comment on the prosecution claims. In a court filing earlier this week, Mr. Hastert, who has stayed largely out of view since the charges emerged nearly a year ago, requested probation and said he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>profoundly sorry‚<U+0080>ù for past conduct, though he did not specify those actions. On Friday, Mr. Hastert also filed under a seal a response to the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-sentence investigation. A hearing is set for next week on whether his filing remains under seal.According to the prosecutors, Mr. Hastert gave one boy, a 14-year-old freshman wrestler, a massage in the locker room, then performed an unspecified sex act on him. Another boy, Stephen Reinboldt, who died in 1995, was sexually abused by Mr. Hastert throughout high school in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his sister and others told the prosecutors. A third boy, who was 17 and remembered Mr. Hastert sitting in a recliner-type chair with a direct view of the locker room shower stalls, said Mr. Hastert had told him that one way to make his wrestling weight was to get a massage, then performed a sexual act. And prosecutors said Mr. Hastert had massaged another boy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s groin area after asking the boy to stay in his hotel room during a wrestling camp.That incident became the center of the prosecution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. It was also the reason that the allegations, which were never exposed during Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s eight years as the Republican speaker of the House, came to light. The boy, known in court documents as Individual A, confronted Mr. Hastert years later, around 2010, asked him why he had done what he did, and sought a settlement ‚<U+0080><U+0094> beginning the payments that would be Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s downfall.In late 2014, as law enforcement authorities were investigating unusually large withdrawals from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bank account, Mr. Hastert said that he was doing nothing unusual with his money ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and that he simply did not trust banks. Not long after, his lawyer told the investigators a different story: The lawyer said that Mr. Hastert was paying large sums ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and promising as much as $3.5 million, the authorities say ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to Individual A because Individual A was extorting him for false allegations of abuse.After a series of recorded phone calls, with Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation, the investigators concluded that there was no extortion, but that Mr. Hastert was actually carrying out an agreed-to settlement for real abuse.Even when Mr. Hastert told Individual A, as investigators listened in, that he needed more time to come up with more money, Individual A ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did not make any threats‚<U+0080>ù and even ‚<U+0080><U+009C>expressed understanding,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. At another point, Individual A seemed agreeable, even empathetic, suggesting that they settle on smaller amounts and keep the payments as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>private, personal matter.‚<U+0080>ù Individual A even pushed Mr. Hastert to tell his wife about the payment agreement, and suggested that an outside lawyer or confidante might be called in.Of the abuse of Individual A, prosecutors said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no ambiguity.‚<U+0080>ùProsecutors said the motel incident had happened during a trip to a wrestling camp, in which several other boys shared a room but where Individual A and Mr. Hastert spent the night together. Individual A told prosecutors he did not know why Mr. Hastert had singled him out.The court filing says Mr. Hastert had the boy strip naked and lay on a bed under the guise of treating a groin pull, but it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became clear to Individual A that defendant was not touching him in a therapeutic manner to address a wrestling injury but was touching him in an inappropriate sexual way.‚<U+0080>ù The boy then ran across the room, confused and embarrassed, before Mr. Hastert asked him to get onto Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s back and to give the coach a massage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Defendant lay on the bed in only his underwear, and Individual A gave him a back massage,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They then went to sleep in the same bed.‚<U+0080>ùWhen Mr. Hastert was charged last year, the accusations rattled the town of Yorkville, Ill., about an hour west of here. Mr. Hastert, a Republican who served as House speaker from 1999 to 2007, was regarded as a hero by many in Yorkville, where he had taught high school. But prosecutors said Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marred by stunning hypocrisy.‚<U+0080>ùThey alluded to a fifth boy from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s days in Yorkville who recalled Coach Hastert brushing against his genitals during a massage at one point. But he said he was unsure whether the contact was intentional though he found it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>very weird.‚<U+0080>ùOf the boys, prosecutors said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He made them feel alone, ashamed, guilty and devoid of dignity. While defendant achieved great success, reaping all the benefits that went with it, these boys struggled, and all are still struggling now with what defendant did to them.‚<U+0080>ùIn the court filing, prosecutors said they believed Mr. Hastert should face up to six months in prison, as suggested under federal guidelines.Prosecutors took note of Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor health, but said that Mr. Hastert could continue getting medical care in prison if needed.Steven A. Block, an assistant United States Attorney, said that Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentencing judge should ‚<U+0080><U+009C>balance the positive nature of defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public service with the need to avoid a public perception that the powerful are treated differently than ordinary citizens when facing sentencing for a serious crime.‚<U+0080>ùBEIJING ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Thirty years after Gao Chengyong embarked on a succession of 11 rape-murders of women in northwest China, a court sentenced him to death on Friday, following an investigation that involved sifting through 230,000 fingerprints.The sentence by a court in Baiyin, a small city in Gansu Province, was not unexpected in China, which executes more prisoners than any other. But the verdict against Mr. Gao, 53, a farmer, itinerant worker and shopkeeper, was widely reported, and applauded, in China, where the killings drew intense attention.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The motives for the defendant Gao Chengyong‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crimes were utterly despicable, the means were utterly vicious, the nature of the crimes utterly vile,‚<U+0080>ù the court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s verdict stated, according to the China News Service, an official agency.The court found that Mr. Gao had killed 11 women, whom he usually followed to their homes. He murdered all but one around Baiyin; another woman was killed in Baotou, a city in the north Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. In many cases, he molested the women and dismembered their bodies. Besides homicide, he also was found guilty of rape and of defiling corpses. He stood trial last July.When Mr. Gao was arrested in 2016, the last murder had taken place 14 years earlier, and the police needed advanced forensic technology, as well as an element of chance, to link him to the crimes.Zhang Enwei, a forensic detective who helped solve the murders, said he had checked 230,000 sets of fingerprints trying to identify a suspect, Beijing News, a newspaper, reported on Friday. But Mr. Gao was one of hundreds of millions of rural migrants who move around, often slipping past city data checks, and he was not caught in the dragnet for fingerprints in Baiyin.But by 2011, the detectives in Baiyin had acquired technology to trace DNA clues, and five years later a relative of Mr. Gao had his DNA sample taken after he was suspected of giving kickbacks. Their shared traits led the investigators to Mr. Gao, who was then running a small store in a school in Baiyin with his wife.Mr. Zhang said Mr. Gao was very calm when he was shown the evidence, according to the Beijing News. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Basically he did not offer too much of a defense,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Mr. Zhang said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew that this day would come.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Gao said he would not appeal the sentence. In an interview last year, his defense lawyer, Zhu Aijun, denied reports that Mr. Gao had chosen as his victims only women and girls with long hair and dressed in red.Mr. Gao said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chosen his targets for crimes at random,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Zhu told a Chinese news website. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That was one of the reasons that it was so hard to crack the case for a long time.‚<U+0080>ùSALT LAKE CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Mormon church is changing its guidelines for how local leaders handle sexual abuse reports and one-on-one meetings with youth a week after a former prominent missionary leader was accused of sexually assaulting two women in the 1980s.The changes announced Monday by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints direct lay leaders never to disregard a report of abuse, a more direct instruction than previous guidelines.A key new rule allows children to bring a parent or adult with them during one-one-one interviews with local church leaders known as bishops. Parents were only allowed in a hallway or adjacent room under old rules. Youth can still go in alone if they choose.Critics say the changes still don't go far enough.The guidelines also tell leaders to never encourage a person to stay in a home or situation where abuse is suspected, guidance not in there before. An introduction to the guidelines says most, but not all, ""allegations of abuse made by assault victims are true, and should be taken seriously and handled with great care.""The meetings with children usually happen twice a year starting at age 12. Bishops ask about topics such as school, sports, hobbies, education goals and family issues. The questions sometimes delve into sexual behavior because of the church's strict teachings on abstinence before marriage.Last year, a group of Mormons and ex-Mormons demanded an end to the one-on-one interviews and a prohibition on all sexual questions.Sam Young, a Mormon father from Houston who is leading the campaign, said Tuesday the changes don't go far enough. He said a parent or adult should be required for all meetings. He said sexual questions often become explicit and argues children should only be asked if they are obeying the faith's law of chastity.The group plans a protest march Friday in Salt Lake City and expects to deliver 50,000 signatures to church headquarters.""Our march is even more important than it's ever been because we know the church is listening,"" said Young, 65, a former bishop and missionary. ""I care about the church. This is my church. What are we're doing harming these children gives my church a horrid name.""Mormon church spokesman Eric Hawkins on Tuesday pointed to previous comments that the interviews allow bishops to get to know youth better and determine their religious habits and obedience to God. The bishops are instructed how to handle the meetings and swear to keep the conversations confidential, he said.""They are counseled to not be unnecessarily probing or invasive in their questions, but should allow a young person to share their experiences, struggles and feelings,"" Hawkins said.Former Mormon Amy Hall, 56, compared the changes to ""putting a Band-Aid on open surgery.""She said she was molested around the age of 12 by a bishop in Bakersfield, California, causing her a lifetime of shame and leading her to leave the faith in her 20s. The Associated Press doesn't normally name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Hall agreed to share her story to support Young's campaign and said she hopes other Mormon children don't have to endure similar abuse.She never reported her abuse and only recently confronted how it impacted her life, adding she is in therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Asking children about sexual things is perverted,"" Hall said.A letter sent by new Mormon president Russell M. Nelson to local and regional leaders in the U.S. and Canada announced the changes. ""This global issue continues to be of great concern to us today,"" Nelson wrote.The changes come as the church investigates two allegations of sexual abuse against a former missionary leader in the 1980s. Joseph L. Bishop has denied the allegations through his adult son but he acknowledged in a police interview that he asked one of the women to expose her breasts at a time when he was president of the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.Bishop is also heard apologizing on a secretly recorded conversation made by one of the victims. He is heard saying he molested the second woman during a massage that he said got ""too frisky.""The church said it knew previously about both claims, but declined to discipline Bishop because the allegations couldn't be verified.This past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Denver ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The radio host whom Taylor Swift has accused of groping her testified Tuesday that her version of what occurred is false and that her account, embraced and acted upon by his employers, ruined his life.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cost me my career, the thing I love to do, my passion,‚<U+0080>ù the host, David Mueller, who was known on air as Jackson, said. He was the first witness to testify in the trial that grew from the civil case he filed in 2015 against Ms. Swift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been hard on my friends,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has an impact on my girlfriend. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable.‚<U+0080>ùIn court documents, Ms. Swift says Mr. Mueller put his hand up her dress and grabbed her bottom as he posed for a photograph with her before a June 2, 2013, concert in Denver. Mr. Mueller contends Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account led the Denver radio station KYGO to fire him and he later sued the entertainer, her mother and one of her managers. Ms. Swift then countersued, accusing Mr. Mueller of assault and battery.Eight jurors ‚<U+0080><U+0094> six women and two men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will decide the two suits and they listened Tuesday in United States District Court here as both sides outlined their cases.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, hammered at Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility during cross-examination, raising, for example, the disappearance of recordings that Mr. Mueller had secretly made of conversations with his bosses about Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations. And while Mr. Mueller said he had filed suit to clear his name, not to win a specific amount in damages, he acknowledged to Mr. Baldridge that he had hired an expert who determined the termination had cost him nearly $3 million.Mr. Mueller also acknowledged a strained relationship with his superiors at KYGO before the encounter with Ms. Swift and he noted that his suit targets only Ms. Swift and her associates, not the station or its executives.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He wants you to give him the payday,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Baldridge told the jurors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is trying to make the victim pay the price.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift, who also is scheduled to testify, sat with her lawyers and looked at Mr. Mueller occasionally during his testimony. At times she appeared to be taking notes which she shared with her mother. It is unclear when Ms. Swift will take the stand.Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice was shaky at the start of his testimony under questioning by his lawyer but grew steadier. Pressed hard for answers during the cross-examination, his voice occasionally rose in pitch and several times he looked toward the judge, as if for support, when questions came in a barrage.His lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, said in his opening statement that his client, who was with his girlfriend during the photo shoot, had no reason to jeopardize a lucrative job and a budding relationship by groping Ms. Swift.Mr. Mueller repeatedly denied groping Ms. Swift. He said that he reached out with his right arm and a closed hand and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>felt what seemed to be a rib cage‚<U+0080>ù with his knuckles as he rushed to get into position for the photograph. In that image, which was shown to jurors Tuesday, Ms. Swift is standing at a slight distance from Mr. Mueller, whose right arm is extended behind her back and toward her bottom. His hand is not visible and is it not possible to see whether the back of her skirt has been moved.Under questioning from Mr. Baldridge, Mr. Mueller said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible‚<U+0080>ù his hand came into contact with Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bottom, and if so she had a right to tell KYGO officials.Mr. Mueller also testified about a conversation he said he had with his boss, Hershel Coomer, known professionally as Eddie Haskell. He said Mr. Coomer, a longtime acquaintance of Ms. Swift, told him that he had greeted her at the Pepsi Center by putting his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hand on her butt.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mueller described Mr. Coomer going on to speculate that the singer wore bicycle shorts under her stage outfits. Mr. Mueller said he did not give that account to imply Mr. Coomer had groped Ms. Swift.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer said Mr. Coomer would testify that he never said the things Mr. Mueller has attributed to him.Mr. Baldridge described Ms. Swift as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taking a stand through this case for all women, including my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fans rose early for a chance to see her in court and filled a quarter of the courtroom. The presiding judge, William J. Mart√≠nez, set aside 32 seats for the public in the courtroom and 75 in an overflow room with a closed circuit video feed of the proceedings.Lucy Peterson, 17, arrived at the downtown Denver courthouse just after 4 a.m. Tuesday with two friends from her Denver high school to seize the first places in a line that had grown to two dozen by 8 a.m. Ms. Peterson said she believed many of Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s admirers had experienced sexual harassment and looked up to the star for speaking out about something that others might be embarrassed or afraid to address.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shedding light on the issue and I hope bringing more attention to it,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Peterson said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her experiences,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not different from ours.‚<U+0080>ùSYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats.But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter.Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crony politics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,‚<U+0080>ù said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland.The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is not a healthy place,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Joyce, a gregarious bull of a man often seen in a trademark Akubra bush hat, now faces a series of uncomfortable questions:‚<U+0080>¢ Were public funds used to cultivate an extramarital affair?‚<U+0080>¢ How did he and his new partner, Vikki Campion, a former journalist, end up in a supporter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s free apartment?‚<U+0080>¢ How did Ms. Campion  secure a high-paying job with a Parliament colleague?‚<U+0080>¢ And, did Mr. Joyce grope a woman after an awards ceremony in 2011?Mr. Joyce, 50, has denied groping and other ministerial misconduct. He has spent much of the week offering defiance and remorse, and trying to hold on to his job.He acknowledged his relationship with Ms. Campion on Tuesday, apologizing to his family, his constituents and the National Party of Australia, which he still leads.But he also told his party colleagues he would not step down. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Every political career has a time of trial,‚<U+0080>ù he said.His stand fits with his longstanding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>just a bloke‚<U+0080>ù appeal. He grew up on a farm in Tamworth, in Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s southeast, which is home of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s largest country music festival. Mr. Joyce is known as an off-the-cuff maverick who is loyal less to ideology than to his constituents.But since 2004, he has been a Canberra man. He was a senator for Queensland and then joined the House of Representatives in 2013. He became leader of the National Party and deputy prime minister in 2016.Mr. Joyce is no stranger to scandal. A few years ago he made headlines worldwide when he threatened to euthanize two dogs belonging to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after the celebrity couple brought them to Australia without the proper documentation and quarantine.Last year, Mr. Joyce was one of several politicians revealed as holding dual citizenship.After the High Court ruled that he had been ineligible to run for Parliament because of it, Mr. Joyce renounced his New Zealand citizenship and returned to his district to campaign again for his seat. He won comfortably.But experts say the backlash has only been intensified by his supposed authenticity, his eagerness to parade his wife and four children in political campaigns, and his brash conservative positions, like his opposition to same-sex marriage, which he argued would destroy families.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The public expected a Barnaby that was a solid country family man, and we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re seeing that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not that at all,‚<U+0080>ù said Jill Sheppard, a lecturer in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there was a political trait Australians hate, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hypocrisy,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said.But the biggest threat to Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s career may involve questions about the mingling of adultery, money and power.Records show he claimed a travel allowance for 50 nights in Canberra last year when Parliament was not in session, far more than other senior leaders.Government watchdogs and journalists have also zeroed in on two high-paying positions that were allegedly created for Ms. Campion in the offices of a party colleague, Senator Matt Canavan.Mr. Joyce and Prime Minister Turnbull ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has continued to back him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> said the jobs were beyond reproach because Ms. Campion was not technically his partner at the time.Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s critics contest that assertion.Officially, for now, Mr. Joyce still has the support of his party. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Barnaby Joyce is the best deliverer for rural and regional Australians in generations,‚<U+0080>ù  Bridget McKenzie, the Nationals deputy, told reporters on Wednesday.But time is not on his side. Mr. Turnbull is scheduled for an overseas trip that includes meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23, which would make Mr. Joyce the acting prime minister.A broader reckoning on the capital‚<U+0080><U+0099>s workplace culture may also be coming.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the Australian public feels the political class is isolated and don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t appreciate their concerns, then that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem the political class has to respond to,‚<U+0080>ù said Andrew Giles, a Labor Party politician.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not meeting people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expectations,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re legitimate expectations.‚<U+0080>ùIf ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù suffered any loss of visibility during its monthlong Winter Olympics hiatus, the show got a most unusual promotional boost on Friday. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when President Trump, a frequent target of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù and a once-vocal critic of the show, broke a monthslong silence and went on Twitter to vent his spleen at Alec Baldwin, his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù impersonator.A complete rundown of the Trump-Baldwin spat can be found here, but to quickly summarize, Baldwin in an interview on Thursday said that every time he plays the president now, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like agony,‚<U+0080>ù adding that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we have to get rid of him.‚<U+0080>ù In response, Trump tweeted that Baldwin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me‚<U+0080>ù and that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>agony for those who were forced to watch.‚<U+0080>ù Baldwin then followed with a series of tweets in which he mused, among other things, that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to stick around in the role long enough ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride‚<U+0080>ù to Mar-a-Lago.This weekend‚<U+0080><U+0099>s broadcast of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.,‚<U+0080>ù hosted by Charles Barkley and featuring the musical guest Migos, didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t directly acknowledge the feud, though it did give Baldwin plenty of airtime to lampoon the president in its opening sketch.In what purported to be another presidential listening session on gun control, Baldwin (as Trump) led off by addressing the audience: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tonight I am here to bring you a message of healing and a show of unity,‚<U+0080>ù he said as he looked at his notes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hear you and I care. Rent ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Lego Ninjago Movie.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Sorry, Eric scribbled some notes on there, too.‚<U+0080>ùAfter contemplating the idea of taking guns away from all Americans ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even whites‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+0094> Baldwin went on to address the latest personnel losses in the Trump administration. Paying homage to Hope Hicks, the outgoing White House communications director, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like a daughter to me. So smart, so hot. You know, I hate seeing her go but I love watching her walk away.‚<U+0080>ùIn her absence, Baldwin said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jared Kushner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basically the hottest chick left in the place.‚<U+0080>ù And when he sought assurance from Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that he was still on board, the camera cut to an empty chair with McMaster‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name in front of it.Turning to the subject of tariffs, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Both sides hated it. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I said I was going to run this country like a business. That business is a Waffle House at 2 a.m. Crazies everywhere, staff walking out in the middle of their shift, managers taking money out of the cash register to pay off the Russian mob.‚<U+0080>ùIn other highlights from the episode:Though he occasionally stumbled in his delivery, Barkley, the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Inside the NBA‚<U+0080>ù analyst, scored with a pointed comedic commentary on the role of athletes in American civic life. He began:Alluding to the Fox News host Laura Ingraham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recent criticism of LeBron James, Barkley added:At the conclusion of his monologue, Barkley traded riffs with the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Michael Che. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud to stand for the anthem,‚<U+0080>ù Barkley said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unless Fergie is singing it, and I just fall over laughing.‚<U+0080>ùChe responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I stay seated for the anthem, because I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m still in my Uber. Because black people are always late.‚<U+0080>ùOn the night before the Oscars, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù imagined a far more scathing (if timely) event called the Grabbies, presented by the Academy of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Hollywood and dedicated, as an announcer described, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>celebrating this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worst behavior in entertainment.‚<U+0080>ù Its categories include Handsiest Actor, Best Animated Grope, Worst Thing Done to a Plant and the coveted Cecil B. Molestin‚<U+0080><U+0099> Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as Most Open Robe. Previewing his possible awards speech, an actor played by Pete Davidson said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, first, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to thank guns for pivoting the national conversation away from harassment. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d also like to thank my uncle for always saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Boys will be boys.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Even when it was, like, O.J.‚<U+0080>ùPlaying the soon-to-be departed Hope Hicks, Cecily Strong recalled her time at the Trump White House as if it were summer camp. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You make all these new friends,‚<U+0080>ù she explained. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You barely get any sleep and then everybody leaves after eight weeks.‚<U+0080>ù She bid farewell to friends like Kellyanne Conway (‚<U+0080><U+009C>You taught me that a strong woman can run a campaign and win. And you showed me what I could turn into if I stick around too long‚<U+0080>ù), and in a final message to her colleagues, she said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll see you guys at the reunion in 10 years. Seven with good behavior.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù cast member Leslie Jones, who provided running commentary on the Winter Olympics both in person and over Twitter, spoke to the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Colin Jost about her time in Pyeongchang. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a six-foot black woman,‚<U+0080>ù Jones told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You think I stand out in America? Everybody in Korea was 4-foot-1. They either thought I was an athlete or a guy. Some of them thought I was a Transformer, but Transformers don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t eat Korean barbecue like that.‚<U+0080>ùAt the end of her segment, Jones brought out Hilary Knight, a member of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> gold-medal winning women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hockey team, and gave Jost a warning. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be talking about how you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to teach me something,‚<U+0080>ù Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got friends who are gold-medal Olympians.‚<U+0080>ùTo understand what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s at stake in the battle between Apple and the F.B.I. over cracking open a terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphone, it helps to be able to predict the future of the tech industry.For that, here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one bet you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never lose money on: Digital technology always grows hungrier for more personal information, and we users nearly always accede to its demands. Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphones hold a lot of personal data ‚<U+0080><U+0094> your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow‚<U+0080><U+0099>s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.Consider all the technologies we think we want ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.This gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.But if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no longer any room for keeping secrets?‚<U+0080><U+009C>This case can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be a one-time deal,‚<U+0080>ù said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is about the future.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards is the author of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intellectual Privacy,‚<U+0080>ù a book that examines the dangers of a society in which technology and law conspire to eliminate the possibility of thinking without fear of surveillance. He argues that intellectual creativity depends on a baseline measure of privacy, and that privacy is being eroded by cameras, microphones and sensors we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re all voluntarily surrounding ourselves with.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>deviant‚<U+0080><U+0099> ideas ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The particular legal issue is actually quite narrow,‚<U+0080>ù James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., wrote in a blog post on Sunday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s it.‚<U+0080>ùBut civil liberties activists say they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d have an easier time believing Mr. Comey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s assurances if there weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a long history of the government relying on legal cases based on old technology to decide how to handle newer technologies. Courts in the 1960s and 1970s created rules for the wiretapping of analog phone calls; those rulings were later applied as the basis for mass surveillance of the Internet.‚<U+0080><U+009C>By and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before email, before search engines, before social networks,‚<U+0080>ù said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Soghoian pointed out the government had already tried to turn connected devices into surveillance machines. In a mob case more than a decade ago, the F.B.I. asked a company that made an in-dash roadside assistance device ‚<U+0080><U+0094> something like OnStar, which uses a cellular phone to connect to an operator in case of an emergency ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to secretly record the private conversations of people inside a car. A court ruled against the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s request, but only on the very narrow grounds that bugging the car would have interfered with the proper functioning of the in-dash device.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Soghoian said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Soghoian was referring to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s handy digital assistant, a device that is constantly listening to your household conversations to try to offer you friendly help. The Echo listens for a keyword ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alexa!‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prompts it to start streaming your voice to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s servers to decipher your request. Amazon, which declined to comment on how the Apple case might affect Echo users‚<U+0080><U+0099> privacy, has said it is not constantly recording people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voices, and that it keeps voice recordings only to help the system learn to better understand you.But the Apple case threatens to undermine those promises. If a court can get Apple to hack into an iPhone, why couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t it also force Amazon to change the Echo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s security model so the Echo can record everything you say? Mr. Soghoian believes the Apple case could set that precedent.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Some readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t buy the Amazon Echo. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t put cameras in your house. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re home and when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not.There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.The Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From a historical perspective, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re entering into a very new era,‚<U+0080>ù said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.‚<U+0080>ùBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Now we have a surveillance-enabled world,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Granick said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cheap, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy. The question that society has to ask is, Is that what we really want?‚<U+0080>ùAn Alaska Airlines pilot has sued the airline, alleging she was drugged and raped by another pilot during a layover last year.The lawsuit by Betty Pina, 39, was filed in King County Superior Court in Washington State on Wednesday, 20 days after it was presented to the airline on Feb. 13. A copy of the complaint was provided by her lawyer, Eric John Makus.It claims that Ms. Pina, an Army veteran who flew helicopter missions in Afghanistan, was the co-pilot on a June flight with the captain from Anchorage to Seattle to Minneapolis, where the two had a scheduled layover.According to the complaint, the pilot asked Ms. Pina to join him for pizza and drinks in the hotel bar where flight crews spend time. Once there, Ms. Pina said she had one glass of wine, and then he brought her a second. Sitting on a stool, she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hard time keeping her head up‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>things appeared to be closing in,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint says.It claims that he proceeded to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>drug Ms. Pina and rape her during a state of involuntary intoxication.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawsuit was reported this week by The Seattle Times and other local news outlets.In an interview late on Thursday, Ms. Pina, reached between flights, repeated many of the details in the lawsuit. It says she blacked out, and when she came to early the next morning, she was in his hotel room bed, naked from the waist down; her underwear was in her purse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew something gravely bad had happened,‚<U+0080>ù she said in the interview.In the lawsuit, she said she was sick and vomited, and when she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>challenged‚<U+0080>ù the pilot, he denied that there had been sexual contact and replied, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You were coming on to me pretty hard.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the lawsuit, a flight attendant told a flight operations officer that she saw the pilot walking down the hall ‚<U+0080><U+009C>with a girl and two glasses of wine,‚<U+0080>ù and that the attendant expressed concern about flying with him.The two were taken off duty for the return to Seattle on June 6, the day after the episode. Ms. Pina said over subsequent weeks, she reported details of what she could remember to the union, an airline human resource official and an investigator referred by the airline. She did not report the episode to the police.She did not fly again until January, she said.Ms. Pina is seeking damages for workplace rape and the airline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unlawfully retaliatory‚<U+0080>ù actions, according to the complaint. It claims that the airline has failed to hold the male pilot accountable and that he poses a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>threat to other employees.‚<U+0080>ùCourts in the United States have previously tackled the issue of sexual harassment of flight crews during layovers, expanding the definition of a work site. In 2001, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Delta Air Lines was potentially liable for not doing enough to stop what a flight attendant said was a rape by another attendant, even though the events occurred when the two were off duty in a hotel room.In a statement, Alaska Airlines said it was taking the matter seriously.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our policy is to withhold an employee from work during this type of investigation,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was immediately removed from flying back in June and remains on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.‚<U+0080>ùThe pilot, who is not named as a defendant, could not be reached on Friday. He has not been charged with a crime.Ms. Pina has been flying for 17 years, including seven years of active duty military service that included flying Chinook helicopters in Afghanistan, for which she was featured in a PBS documentary series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kansas to Kandahar: Citizen Soldiers at War.‚<U+0080>ùShe started working for Alaska Airlines in 2016. She said that after years in the military, she was accustomed to reporting problems only to her superiors. That, she said, might explain why she did not report what happened to the police when she returned to the Seattle area.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought to call the police,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was more worried about my job than my own personal safety.‚<U+0080>ùBut over time, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew I failed myself.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Pina said that she pursued the lawsuit because she wanted the company to hold the pilot accountable. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened on an overnight with a captain who was abusing his position of authority in an opportunity with me being in a hotel right next to him,‚<U+0080>ù she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It needs to stop from being swept under the rug,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t hate my company. I just hope they step up, and say we have zero tolerance and maybe make any future attackers think twice and not follow through.‚<U+0080>ùA prominent volleyball coach in Illinois is accused of sexually abusing and raping teenage athletes in the 1980s, in hotel rooms, on a train and elsewhere, according to a class-action lawsuit filed this week.The coach, Rick Butler, and his wife, Cheryl, deceived parents and young players into joining the Sports Performance Volleyball Club in Aurora, Ill., the lawsuit claims, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>based upon false information and material omissions‚<U+0080>ù regarding allegations of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sexual abuse of underage girls‚<U+0080>ù by Mr. Butler.The Butlers were named as defendants in the  lawsuit, which was filed in District Court in Illinois on Tuesday by Laura Mullen, the mother of an athlete who trained at the club in 2012. Ms. Mullen said that she would never have sent her daughters to the club had she known about the allegations against Mr. Butler.The court documents, reported by The Chicago Sun-Times on Tuesday, say that Mr. Butler continued to coach even though U.S.A. Volleyball, the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national governing body, barred him in 1995 over allegations that he sexually abused three teenage athletes. The organization partly lifted the ban in 2000, and Mr. Butler, who was never charged with a crime, returned to coaching. He was permanently barred earlier this year.The lawsuit, which seeks a jury trial and compensation for fees paid to the club, claims at least six teenagers were abused by Mr. Butler and describes allegations from five of them. Some of their accounts were first published in November by The Sun-Times.In a statement at the time to the newspaper, released through a lawyer, Mr. Butler said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have never sexually abused any individual.‚<U+0080>ù On Thursday, the office of the lawyer, Terry Ekl, said he was not representing Mr. Butler in the class-action lawsuit.Two people who answered the telephone at Mr. Butler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s club on Thursday said the couple was not there, and the Butlers did not reply to emails. It was not clear whether they had a lawyer.Ms. Mullen said she was never informed of any investigations into the abuse, including those carried out by the state Department of Children and Family Services and by U.S.A. Volleyball. In the 72-page lawsuit, Mr. Butler is described as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the most powerful coach in youth volleyball,‚<U+0080>ù with the ability to place athletes at top college programs.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For over three decades, Rick has used his position of power to sexually abuse no fewer than six underage teenage girls, and likely many more,‚<U+0080>ù the lawsuit says.The women who have accused Mr. Butler are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which details their accounts. One described alleged sexual abuse and rape by Mr. Butler starting when she was 16, in the early 1980s, during team trips, in a hotel, and in a train bathroom. Another accused Mr. Butler of sexually abusing her in 1986, when she was 16, during a team trip to Japan, and raping her in a hotel room when they returned. The lawsuit also claims that he assaulted the teenagers in the weight room of a gym, his car and his apartment.Mr. Butler ‚<U+0080><U+009C>set up an environment of dependency and fear‚<U+0080>ù by threatening to derail the teenagers‚<U+0080><U+0099> athletic careers if they did not accede to his demands, the lawsuit claims. Ms. Butler is accused of harassing the women on social media and with a phone call to keep them quiet.In 1995, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services investigated Mr. Butler, according to the lawsuit, and determined that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>credible evidence supported an indicated report of abuse.‚<U+0080>ù An administrative law judge later concluded that Mr. Butler ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had sexual relationships with at least three players.‚<U+0080>ùHad parents known ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that a child sexual predator would coach their teenage daughters,‚<U+0080>ù the lawsuit says, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they never would have given money to defendants and never would have sent their girls to Sports Performance.‚<U+0080>ùIn response to the Sun-Times report, U.S.A. Volleyball announced in January that it would permanently bar Mr. Butler. On Feb. 9, the Amateur Athletic Union, which promotes and develops amateur sports in the United States, said it had permanently disqualified Mr. Butler from its activities.The lawsuit comes at a time when the sports world has been shaken by cases of sexual abuse against young athletes. In hearings in Michigan in January, dozens of young women and teenagers described abuse by Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics, who also ran a clinic at Michigan State University.Dr. Nassar received several lengthy prison sentences, including one of 40 to 175 years, and the case prompted investigations and a shake-up at U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State.The lawsuit in Illinois claims an M.S.U. coach had helped Mr. Butler identify recruits and took an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>active role‚<U+0080>ù in discouraging his alleged victims from speaking out.The lawsuit also included an excerpt from a document it says Ms. Butler published online last month, and which is no longer available, in which Mr. Butler said the 1980s were a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>different time and era in the sport of volleyball and life in general‚<U+0080>ù and that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>could have used better judgment.‚<U+0080>ùJay Edelson, Ms. Mullen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, said on Thursday that his law firm would donate the fees from any award in the case to charity. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will not profit from this,‚<U+0080>ù he said.In 1995, Drew Dixon was working her dream job as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, helping to oversee a chart-topping album and a ubiquitous single by Method Man and Mary J. Blige. But as her star rose, Ms. Dixon, then 24, was spiraling into depression, she said, because of prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, Russell Simmons, the rap mogul and co-founder of the label.On work calls, he would talk graphically about how she aroused him. At a staff meeting, he asked her to sit on his lap. He regularly exposed his erect penis to her. Late that year, Mr. Simmons raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment, Ms. Dixon said. She quit Def Jam soon after.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was broken,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In recent interviews, four women spoke on the record about a pattern of violent sexual behavior by Mr. Simmons, disclosing incidents from 1988 to 2014. Three of the women say that he raped them.In each case, numerous friends and associates said they were told of the incidents at the time. The women said they were inspired to come forward in the aftermath of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, as victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> stories have been newly elevated and more often believed.Told in detail about the rape accusations and other misconduct, Mr. Simmons, 60, said in a statement: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have enormous respect for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power.‚<U+0080>ù[Read Russell Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Complete Statement]Last month, Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a forefather of hip-hop who went on to great success in fashion, media and more ‚<U+0080><U+0094> apologized for being ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thoughtless and insensitive‚<U+0080>ù and announced he was stepping down from his companies after the screenwriter Jenny Lumet became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual assault at the time.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have re-dedicated myself to spiritual learning, healing and working on behalf of the communities to which I have devoted my life,‚<U+0080>ù he said in his statement on Wednesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have accepted that I can and should get dirt on my sleeves if it means witnessing the birth of a new consciousness about women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What I will not accept is responsibility for what I have not done. I have conducted my life with a message of peace and love. Although I have been candid about how I have lived in books and interviews detailing my flaws, I will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.‚<U+0080>ùThe most powerful men and companies in popular music have thus far gone largely unscathed in the national reckoning over sexual abuse. A major reason: Sex and debauchery are built into the music industry, where the boundaries between work and play blur in late nights at clubs and studios, and many women have scant power or incentive to complain about being mistreated.These women still face powerful industry gatekeepers like Mr. Simmons, whose pedigree and ability to make or break careers allowed his abusive behavior to go unchallenged for decades, his accusers contend. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Russell was like the king of hip-hop,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.She said she was later harassed by another boss, L.A. Reid, the music legend known for his work with TLC and Mariah Carey, driving her from a business where women had little autonomy. In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Reid did not address the specific claims but apologized if his words were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misinterpreted.‚<U+0080>ùBlack women, especially, felt powerless against Mr. Simmons and his cohort in the small world of urban music, with several saying that misconduct against them could go unchecked because their place in the industry was so tenuous. They feared being ostracized, or worse.Three of the women now accusing Mr. Simmons were pursuing careers in the music industry that they said were disrupted or derailed in part by their experiences with him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sing for almost a year,‚<U+0080>ù said Tina Baker, a performer who said Mr. Simmons raped her in the early ‚<U+0080><U+0099>90s, when he was her manager. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The second he agreed to work with me, my budget increased, the label was paying more attention to me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker recalled. But after the assault, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into oblivion.‚<U+0080>ùFirst known as a hyperactive party promoter turned manager from Queens who helped boost Run-DMC, Mr. Simmons was among the first to view hip-hop as a big business and cultural force. In 1983, with the producer Rick Rubin, he made Def Jam the defining rap label of its era, with hits by the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Public Enemy.Even after Mr. Simmons sold his remaining stake in Def Jam for a reported $100 million in 1999, he served as an ambassador for hip-hop through comedy (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Def Comedy Jam‚<U+0080>ù), clothing (Phat Farm) and activism. Today, his company Rush Communications oversees an array of businesses and nonprofits.In 1987, Toni Sallie, a music journalist for the trade magazine Black Radio Exclusive, met Mr. Simmons while on assignment. She found him to be a charming, if gruff, playboy. They ended up going on a few dates before Ms. Sallie, then 28, decided they were not a match.But the two remained cordial, Ms. Sallie said, and in the fall of 1988, Mr. Simmons invited her to his Manhattan apartment for a party he said he was hosting for his girlfriend. When Ms. Sallie arrived, the place was empty except for Mr. Simmons, she recalled. Saying he wanted to show her the apartment, Mr. Simmons led her to his bedroom.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He pushed me on the bed and jumped on top of me, and physically attacked me,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We were fighting. I said no.‚<U+0080>ù He raped her, she said. Two friends, Sheila Brody and Arlene Hirschkowitz, and a colleague confirmed that Ms. Sallie told them about the assault around the time it happened.Through his lawyer, Brad D. Rose, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he dated Ms. Sallie but denied any nonconsensual sex.Ms. Sallie said she was too afraid to report the assault: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I went to the police, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how that would turn out.‚<U+0080>ùShe also worried about her burgeoning career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to understand, I was very much in a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s game,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Sallie said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Black women were just starting to break into the field.‚<U+0080>ùAbout a year later, at a music conference in South Florida, Ms. Sallie, who was then working for Warner Bros. Records, said she encountered Mr. Simmons in a hotel lobby. When he tried to lead her to a dark beach, she resisted and he attacked her, grabbing her by the hair, she said, and even chasing her into the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s restroom before she escaped to her room, where she barricaded the door. (‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did Mr. Simmons conduct himself inappropriately,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rose said.)To this day, Ms. Sallie said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t feel comfortable in a room full of men.‚<U+0080>ùMusic executives she told about the hotel incident brushed it off, she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt alone for 29 years,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like nobody would listen to me.‚<U+0080>ùFollowing the reports of alleged misconduct by Mr. Simmons in November, Ms. Sallie said she contacted the Manhattan district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to accuse him.A law enforcement official confirmed that a woman contacted the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to report an incident from 1988 and added that a different anonymous woman had recently reported an incident from 1991. The official said the incidents had occurred so long ago that the statute of limitations had lapsed and the crimes had not been prosecuted. There are no details about the woman from the 1991 incident.But the official said the women had been referred to the New York Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Special Victims squad so that there would be a record of their complaints if more recent allegations were to emerge.Ms. Baker, the singer, thought Mr. Simmons could elevate her career as her new manager. She had performed as a backup vocalist for Madonna and Bruce Springsteen, and, as Tina B, released pop and dance records in the 1980s.One night in late 1990 or early 1991, she ran into Mr. Simmons at a club, and he invited her back to his apartment to discuss her career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think anything of going,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, having been there many times without incident.This time, though, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it all got really ugly, pretty fast,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. As soon as they entered, Mr. Simmons started pouring drinks and trying to kiss her, leading to a scuffle, she said. She recalled ‚<U+0080><U+009C>him on top of me, pushing me down and him saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fight me,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. She was pinned on the bed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I did nothing, I shut my eyes and waited for it to end.‚<U+0080>ùShe cried the whole way home, she said. In interviews and email, her ex-husband, Arthur Baker, a music producer; her psychologist, Dr. Robin Goldberg; another therapist; and a former roommate all confirmed that she told them she was raped.Mr. Simmons, through his lawyer, said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no recollection of ever having any sexual relations with Ms. Baker.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the assault, Ms. Baker remained tethered to Mr. Simmons professionally, she said. She returned to his apartment for a meeting; Mr. Simmons liked to conduct business while working out in his penthouse. But as soon as he stopped exercising, she said, he pulled out his penis and moved toward her. She fled.Amid strife with her label, she tried to extricate herself from her contract with Mr. Simmons, she said, but he ignored her. Her music ‚<U+0080><U+0094> two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> worth of songwriting and recording ‚<U+0080><U+0094> languished. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a deep depression,‚<U+0080>ù she said, and her recording career foundered.Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did everything he could to professionally promote her career‚<U+0080>ù while Ms. Baker was signed to a label, and then stopped representing her, according to his lawyer.The events took a heavy toll on her romantic relationships. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have sex with a man for almost nine years,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Baker, now a lawyer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a cocoon.‚<U+0080>ùDrew Dixon left Stanford University in 1992 to join the hip-hop revolution.After about two years on the fringes of the business, Ms. Dixon ‚<U+0080><U+0094> whose mother, Sharon Pratt, was mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 until 1995 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had a professional breakthrough: Russell Simmons, whom she had met through friends, was looking for a new A&R executive at Def Jam to scout talent and coordinate hit records.She said he was a decadent figure, complete with a Rolls-Royce ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>living, breathing personification of hip-hop and glamour mixed up‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and his sexual advances started right away and became relentless. At a restaurant, Mr. Simmons pushed Ms. Dixon into a broom closet, she said, and tried to kiss her. At work, he would close the door to her office and expose himself, leading her to give a copy of her key to a male co-worker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>If I ever buzz you, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pick up, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t call me back ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just open my door. That means Russell is in here and he whipped his‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù penis out, she said.Through his lawyer, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he engaged in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>inappropriate conduct‚<U+0080>ù with Ms. Dixon while she worked at Def Jam.Fending him off ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was a full-time job,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Ms. Dixon knew Mr. Simmons valued her expertise. She had an ear for emerging talent, even bringing a rising Notorious B.I.G. to the office.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cut off my one conduit to having any hope of a career,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought if I could survive long enough to have a hit ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a real bona fide hit with my name on it ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I would move categories,‚<U+0080>ù from sexual object to respected colleague.In 1995, Ms. Dixon thought she had found her lifeline. Her first major project ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a soundtrack for the music documentary ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show,‚<U+0080>ù featuring Tupac and A Tribe Called Quest ‚<U+0080><U+0094> went platinum. She and Mr. Simmons were listed as executive producers.One night, as she left the Bowery Bar near Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apartment to get cab money from an A.T.M., she ran into him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have the No. 1 record in the country; I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll order you a car,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled him saying.Waiting for the ride, she let her guard down and entered his apartment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I remember realizing I was cornered,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Dixon, who said she rejected Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual advances that night directly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>many ways to say no‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as well as explaining that she had just had a gynecological procedure and could not have sex. He told her he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and I just blacked out.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The last thing I remember was him pinning me down to kiss me on the bed,‚<U+0080>ù she said. The next thing she recalled was being in Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hot tub, both of them naked and Mr. Simmons gleeful. (Ms. Dixon said she had not been drinking and did not think she had been drugged; rather, she said, she had disassociated from the experience.)Denise Gayle, a friend who was then staying with Ms. Dixon, recalled her coming home in a daze. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She pretty much told me right away that he had sexually assaulted her, that she had told him no, cried and that he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be interested in stopping,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Gayle said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She mentally deteriorated instantly.‚<U+0080>ù Three others confirmed that Ms. Dixon told them about the assault and harassment around that time.Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+009C>emphatically states that he did not have sex with her,‚<U+0080>ù his lawyer said.Soon after, Ms. Dixon said she composed her resignation letter to Def Jam by hand, humiliated and in a panic, crossing out her mistakes rather than starting again. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was going to give up,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Dixon considered escaping to graduate school. But the success of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show‚<U+0080>ù soundtrack had made her taste a commodity, and she started at Arista Records, as an A&R executive under Clive Davis, in 1996. She enjoyed more success, helping to orchestrate smash singles like Whitney Houston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My Love Is Your Love,‚<U+0080>ù Aretha Franklin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Rose Is Still a Rose,‚<U+0080>ù and Santana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maria Maria.‚<U+0080>ùBut even at Arista, the long shadow of Def Jam remained, partly over a dispute about what she said were unpaid business expenses. Ms. Dixon hired a lawyer and threatened to sue Mr. Simmons for sexual harassment, as well as outstanding bills from the label. In 1997, the parties settled out of court. Mr. Rose, Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, confirmed the settlement.Ms. Dixon said she accepted about $30,000 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> around $3,000 for the expenses and the rest for legal fees ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and stayed quiet. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I do not want to be famous for being sexually harassed by Russell Simmons,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said, citing the lingering criticism of black women like Anita Hill, and Desiree Washington, who accused Mike Tyson of rape. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to make records and be famous for that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Dixon hoped to move on with her career at Arista. But in 2000, L.A. Reid replaced Mr. Davis atop the label. Mr. Reid began sexualizing her, Ms. Dixon said, and would turn cold when she denied his unwanted overtures.Ms. Dixon said she tried to parry his come-ons as best she could without offending him. But when she openly defied his demands ‚<U+0080><U+0094> declining his invitation to meet him late at night at his hotel; wearing jeans when he insisted on skirts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she worried that her artists would receive short shrift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a quid pro quo: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have power, you want access, sleep with me ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m going to be really mean to you the next day. And there will be consequences,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Reid left this year as the chairman of Epic Records following accusations of sexual harassment. Told in detail of Ms. Dixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, he said in a statement to The Times: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.‚<U+0080>ùIn 2002, at the top of her game, Ms. Dixon left the music industry for Harvard Business School. She concluded that no matter how many hits she had, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I could not have success in this industry unless I slept with somebody ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a gatekeeper,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that I would be doing it to advance my career, I would hate myself.‚<U+0080>ùPost-Def Jam, Mr. Simmons rebranded his image from high-rolling modelizer, partying with Donald Trump and Naomi Campbell, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Uncle Rush,‚<U+0080>ù a spiritual yogi and elder statesman. He released books like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Success Through Stillness‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Happy Vegan,‚<U+0080>ù while focusing on philanthropy and political advocacy.Ms. Dixon said that years after her experience with Mr. Simmons at Def Jam, he apologized to her at an industry event. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have daughters and I do yoga now, Drew, and I know what I did was wrong, and I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.Yet this Mr. Simmons is not the one that Christina Moore said she encountered in Miami at Art Basel in 2014. Ms. Moore, who was 26 at the time, and a friend bumped into Mr. Simmons in the elevator of Soho Beach House.The women were meeting friends at a bar there, but were lost, Ms. Moore said. Mr. Simmons suggested he knew where to go. Ms. Moore and her friend followed him; he led them to his room. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt duped,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Immediately, Mr. Simmons began to run a bath, Ms. Moore said, and then pushed her up against a column in the room ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hands all over my body, up and down,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt assaulted.‚<U+0080>ù He told Ms. Moore that she was a bad girl and threatened to tie her up, she said. Ms. Moore and her friend bolted.Mr. Simmons recalled meeting Ms. Moore and her friend. He said the women followed him to his room of their own accord and asked him about getting into parties. His lawyer said running the bath was Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>signal to Ms. Moore and her friend to leave.‚<U+0080>ù He denied any misconduct.The whole interaction lasted about five minutes, Ms. Moore said, but it stayed with her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt a lot of shame and guilt at ending up in that situation,‚<U+0080>ù she said.When reports of Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged sexual misconduct began circulating, Ms. Moore grew more alarmed and decided to come forward. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would hate to think what would have happened if I were alone,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Baker, too, spent years feeling guilt over how she handled the situation with Mr. Simmons. After the Weinstein revelations, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I started to get very agitated and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, scanning for mentions of misconduct by Mr. Simmons. She concluded that she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>moral duty‚<U+0080>ù to tell her story.Ms. Sallie said speaking out was a form of affirmation, and relief. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I still cry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. But, she added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m happy that the truth is coming out. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m ready.‚<U+0080>ùThe professional price Ms. Dixon paid was steep, she said. She cannot listen to the taste-shifting music she helped create; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too emotionally taxing. Her promising career was curtailed, her ear for talent wasted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I gave up something that I loved to do,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I erased myself.‚<U+0080>ùNow, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want people to know why.‚<U+0080>ùMAIDUGURI, Nigeria ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The camp was supposed to be a refuge. Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been stolen by war ever since the sixth grade, when she was abducted from her home and raped repeatedly by Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fighters for the next three years.She finally escaped last spring, slipping into the bush while her captors slept. Fourteen years old and alone, she made it to a camp for victims of the war, and had just settled in for the night when she heard footsteps outside her tent. A security officer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice instructed her to come out. Frightened, she obeyed.He took her to his quarters, she said, and raped her.Hours later, after she had returned to her tent, another officer arrived, she said. He raped her, too.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The same day I was brought there, soldiers started coming to rape me,‚<U+0080>ù Falmata said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They did it one after another. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure those two knew about each other.‚<U+0080>ùRape has been a defining horror of the war with Boko Haram, which has consumed northeastern Nigeria for eight years and spread beyond its borders. At least 7,000 women and girls have endured Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual violence, the United Nations estimates. Militants kidnap and rape young girls, teenagers and women, handing them out as so-called brides who are sometimes passed from fighter to fighter.But Nigerian security forces have also raped victims of the war, preying on the people they are assigned to protect. Dozens of cases of rape, sexual violence and sexual exploitation were reported in seven camps in Borno State last year alone, carried out by guards, camp officials, security officers and members of civilian vigilante groups, the United Nations says.More than a year ago, the Nigerian government pledged to investigate the allegations of rape in camps for people displaced by the war, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>these very distressing reports will not be taken lightly.‚<U+0080>ù But accounts of sexual assaults in the camps are still common, including from young girls who say they were raped by soldiers on many occasions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The soldiers would come and hold me so tight,‚<U+0080>ù one 13-year-old girl said in an interview. She said she had been raped about 10 times this year at a camp in Maiduguri, the city at the center of the fight against Boko Haram, before running away for her own safety.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They were old enough to be my parents,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the soldiers who raped her.The Nigerian military has cleared parts of the countryside to hunt for Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hide-outs, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to move into huge settlements throughout northeastern Nigeria. Many other civilians have made it to the camps on their own after fleeing Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deadly assaults.Most of the camps are overflowing, with new arrivals every day. Food and water are often in short supply, residents say, and health workers are battling a cholera outbreak that has killed dozens.At night, the camps are dimly lit. Aid workers come during the day, but typically not after sunset because of wartime curfews. Security forces tightly control who goes in and out of the camps, sometimes coercing women and girls to trade sex for food.Government officials say they need 24-hour security to protect the residents, especially since some of the camps are regular targets of suicide bombers deployed by Boko Haram.But in one camp, called Teachers Village, some residents said the security forces had worked out a system to select their victims. Young women were called to cook for them. After the women finished, security officers insisted that they clean up, telling them to go bathe in the officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> quarters as the men watched.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At first none of us knew they were doing this, but then the stories started to spread around camp that anyone cooking for them would be raped,‚<U+0080>ù said Hadiza, 18.After living in the camp for several weeks, Hadiza said, she was picked to cook for the officers. She was terrified.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Definitely my time has come,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled thinking.Later, she was asked to serve water to four security officers in their room as they dined. One by one they left, she said, until only one man remained. He dragged her into a separate room and raped her, she said.Hadiza was injured, she said, but didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ask for medical care, fearing that the officers would seek revenge. She said she tried to keep a low profile for a couple of weeks, but officers spotted her and raped her again. She said she had been raped as many as 20 times in the camp.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once they identified you as a girl they wanted to have sex with, they would hardly leave you alone a single day,‚<U+0080>ù Hadiza said.By spring, word of the rapes at Teachers Village camp had spread so widely across Maiduguri that people began showing up at the gates to look for missing relatives. Distant relatives arrived for Hadiza and took her away.Last year, President Muhammadu Buhari called for an investigation into sexual assaults at the camps after Human Rights Watch detailed the abuse in a report, ordering new measures to protect the vulnerable. Security officers have received more training, and at least 100 female officers have been deployed inside the camps. As a result, the number of complaints of sexual abuse has declined, according to some aid groups and the police.The police have arrested several men for sexually abusing and exploiting women and girls, according to the United States Embassy. The arrests, made last December, include two police officers, a prison warden, two civilian militia members, a civil servant and three soldiers.But an Army Special Board of Inquiry said in June that allegations against its soldiers at the camps were unfounded, while Jimoh Moshood, a police spokesman, said the investigations were continuing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Very little progress has been made by Nigerian authorities to implement President Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s promise of justice for the survivors,‚<U+0080>ù said Mausi Segun, the executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The delay reinforces displaced people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sense of helplessness, and likely emboldens more perpetrators to prey on their vulnerability.‚<U+0080>ùIn the war with Boko Haram, Nigerian security forces have been accused of many human rights abuses, including killing innocent civilians and detaining children for months to determine their loyalties.At checkpoints to enter Maiduguri, soldiers and militia members have turned away large groups of displaced people fleeing Boko Haram, unless they can pay an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>entrance fee,‚<U+0080>ù aid workers say. People escaping with their herds are sometimes charged a fee for each animal. Those who can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pay the bribes have been sent back into harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.Inside the camps, soldiers and members of civilian vigilante groups have been accused of forcing people to pay for the privilege of setting up tents or leaky shelters made of tarps and grass. Some displaced people told Amnesty International that they had to sell their belongings to survive, and when they ran out of things to sell, they had to have sex with soldiers and civilian militia members to get food.Falmata, the 14-year-old kidnapped by Boko Haram, said her ordeal began when she was in primary school, enjoying her classwork and dancing to local Kanuri music.Militants stormed into her home and took her while she was caring for her sick mother. They forced her to marry a fighter, but that man died in battle a week later, so they gave her to another husband. She tried to resist, so they gave her a third. Barely a teenager by then, she became pregnant, she said, but the baby died days after he was born.One night, Falmata woke up and realized the whole camp was asleep. Now was the time, she thought. She ran until she reached a village, finding an older woman with a lantern who pointed her to a road. Soldiers spotted her and took her to Dalori Camp, a sprawling site outside Maiduguri.She thought she was being delivered to safety ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but immediately faced the same kind of sexual abuse she had risked her life to flee. And this time it was being committed by the people who were there to protect her.During her two months at the camp, she said, security officers, not always the same men, came for her repeatedly. Falmata described the men as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>soldiers,‚<U+0080>ù but it was unclear if they were members of the military, the police or another security force. She said they carried weapons.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt it would continue forever,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the abuse.She knew she had to flee, again, so she asked for a pass to go to the market. She walked out of the camp the same way she had escaped Boko Haram: alone, with no money and no idea where she was going.As a little girl, she remembered, she had visited her grandmother once in Maiduguri, but she had only a vague idea where. Falmata spotted a man she had seen around the camp who spoke her dialect, and begged for help.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look, I have a problem,‚<U+0080>ù she told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>These people are going to kill me. They come to me every night.‚<U+0080>ùThe two drove around the city for hours, trying to track down Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s grandmother, asking everyone. Eventually, they found her. She had thought Falmata was dead.Falmata now lives with her grandmother, but is too ashamed to tell her what happened. Someday, she hopes to continue her education and become a lawyer. She wants to represent the powerless.The 17-year-old migrant was pregnant. She said she had been raped in her home county, and she knew from the timing that she was carrying her attacker‚<U+0080><U+0099>s child.She wanted to terminate her pregnancy. But she was underage and undocumented, and, after she was caught crossing the border illegally, living in a government shelter.The Trump administration official in charge of her care decided not to grant her access to an abortion ‚<U+0080><U+0094> because, he said, abortion was itself a form of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>violence.‚<U+0080>ùA woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s desire to end a pregnancy springing from rape might be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understandable,‚<U+0080>ù wrote Scott Lloyd, the director of the federal agency that oversees the shelter, in his denial memo on Sunday. But, he wrote, it was not possible to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cure violence with further violence.‚<U+0080>ùHe went on: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We cannot be a place of refuge while we are at the same time a place of violence. We have to choose, and we ought to choose protect life rather than to destroy it.‚<U+0080>ùIt took a lawsuit, a federal court order and an unexpected reversal this week for Jane Poe, as the teenager is known in court papers, to secure access to an abortion. Yet Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo, released by government lawyers in court on Thursday, spells out a fervently uncompromising opposition to abortion that all but guarantees further clashes at the charged intersection of abortion and immigration.The agency Mr. Lloyd leads, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, announced in March that it would prohibit federally funded shelters from taking ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any action that facilitates‚<U+0080>ù an abortion for an unaccompanied minor without his approval. The Trump administration has said that there is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no constitutional right‚<U+0080>ù for young women in the office‚<U+0080><U+0099>s custody to obtain an abortion.The director has personally gone to meet with pregnant teenagers in immigration custody to persuade them not to have abortions, drawing accusations from abortion rights advocates that he is forcing his beliefs onto the young women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This latest revelation exposes the Trump administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s extreme anti-abortion ideology: It seeks to force women to continue pregnancies against their will,‚<U+0080>ù said Brigitte Amiri, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented Jane Poe and two other teenagers who also won the rights to get abortions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will continue to fight to strike down this cruel and heartless policy.‚<U+0080>ùOn Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agency declined to comment on his views on abortion. In October, a spokesman told The Washington Post: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a child in the program who is pregnant, he has been reaching out to her and trying to help as much as possible with life-affirming options.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He by law has custody of these children,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman continued, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and just like a foster parent, he knows that that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot of responsibility, and he is going to make choices that he thinks are best for both the mother and the child.‚<U+0080>ùThe Trump administration had originally opposed a federal judge‚<U+0080><U+0099>s order on Monday to allow Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abortion. Then, for reasons it has not explained, it dropped its legal appeal, clearing Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s path. (She still faces the possibility of deportation.)Government lawyers had pushed to keep Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sealed in court, but agreed to release part of it on Thursday after the A.C.L.U. argued for its unsealing. The group has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy.Though Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers have disclosed almost no information about her out of concerns for her safety and privacy, Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sketches the outlines of her situation. She told shelter workers that she had been raped in her home country, and though she had a boyfriend with whom she had had sex, both she and federal officials came to believe, based on the timing of her assault, that her pregnancy resulted from the rape. She arrived at the border several weeks after the attack.When the shelter confirmed that she was pregnant, she asked for an abortion, only to change her mind after she said her mother had threatened to beat her if she got one. A few days later, however, she decided that she wanted it, and later threatened to hurt herself if she did not receive it. She was nearly 22 weeks pregnant when Mr. Lloyd said no.Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo describes the abortion procedure, known as dilation and evacuation, that she would have to undergo at that stage of pregnancy as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one that even many abortionists find troublesome.‚<U+0080>ù He cites anecdotal evidence, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>impossible to ignore,‚<U+0080>ù that abortions can be a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating trauma‚<U+0080>ù for women, even as he concedes that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>formal research on this matter appears to be sparse.‚<U+0080>ù An abortion would not only fail to erase her trauma, he wrote, but also might ‚<U+0080><U+009C>further traumatize her.‚<U+0080>ùBecause many immigrants are sexually assaulted in their home countries or on the journey through Central America and Mexico to the southern border, cases like Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s are likely to recur.A Gallup poll this year showed that 18 percent of Americans believe that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, a share that has not changed significantly for many years. Half of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances and 29 percent said it should always be legal, according to the poll.The House recently passed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, a measure the White House supports, but it contains an exception for cases of rape. It is unlikely to pass the Senate, where most Democrats and some Republicans generally oppose new laws restricting abortions.KABUL, Afghanistan ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Taliban on Sunday denied an assertion by a freed Canadian hostage that his American wife had been raped during their five years of captivity and that their infant had been killed by the Haqqani network, a brutal arm of the Afghan insurgency.The militants said the child had died during a miscarriage.Soon after arriving in Toronto on Friday with his wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their three children, the former captive, Joshua Boyle, said she had been raped by members of the Haqqani network.He also said the network had authorized ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the murder of my infant daughter,‚<U+0080>ù their fourth child. Ms. Coleman was pregnant when the couple were abducted in 2012 while traveling in Afghanistan.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, rejected the accusations of rape as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fabricated claims‚<U+0080>ù fed to Mr. Boyle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From the beginning up to their freedom, the wife and the husband were not separated even for a few minutes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the reason for that was to avoid any suspicions,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman said by telephone.When Ms. Coleman was about to deliver the child, Mr. Mujahid said, there were no doctors in the area where they were being held.‚<U+0080><U+009C>One female child was naturally miscarried,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mujahid said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No one has intentionally killed the child or carried out any other abuse on them. If that was our plan, they would not have gone home with three children.‚<U+0080>ùMany questions about the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s travels to Afghanistan, their captivity and their eventual release remain unanswered. Several members of the Taliban leadership reached by phone repeated the lines put out in their statement without offering new details.Mr. Mujahid also declined to talk about how the couple had been freed, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>only the few people guarding them‚<U+0080>ù had details of the release and that he was still trying to reach those people.Pakistani officials have said that the family was freed in northwestern tribal areas of the country after their forces acted on intelligence provided to them by the United States.At a news conference, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman for the Pakistani military, said its forces had managed to trace the vehicle carrying the hostages within five hours of a tip from the United States, and had rescued the hostages after blowing out the vehicle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tires. The captors ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fled on foot,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Boyle, in a video message posted by the Pakistani military soon after their freedom, effusively thanked the Pakistani military for a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tremendously professional operation,‚<U+0080>ù and said the military and intelligence forces ‚<U+0080><U+009C>got between the car and the criminals to make sure the prisoners were safe and that my family was safe.‚<U+0080>ùAmerican officials have expressed gratitude to Pakistan for the release, and President Trump called it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a positive moment‚<U+0080>ù in the countries‚<U+0080><U+0099> relationship. The release came as pressure by the Trump administration seemed to be mounting on Pakistan for its ties to the Afghan insurgency.American officials have said repercussions could be severe if Pakistan failed to curtail its support for the Afghan insurgency, and in particular, continue to allow a haven for its leaders, including the Haqqanis.But Afghan officials in Kabul viewed the hostage release as an old Pakistani trick of offering the United States a concession each time the pressure builds. A senior Afghan official said that two and a half years ago, its intelligence service had concluded that the family had been moved across the border into Pakistan, and that the information had been shared with the Americans.In recent years, the Haqqani network has become increasingly integrated with the mainstream Taliban. The network‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, serves as the Taliban‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy supreme leader and has played an important role in the insurgency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s military victories.But the network still maintains its special skills, including hostage-taking and carrying out some of the more sophisticated attacks and bombings in cities like Kabul. The group previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, one of Sirajuddin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s half brothers, in exchange for the freedom of the North American family.The Haqqanis are believed to be still holding Kevin King, a professor of the American University of Afghanistan who was kidnapped in Kabul in 2016; and another American, Paul Overby, whose family said the Haqqanis abducted him in 2014 after he tried to interview the group‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader.Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s persecution of Rohingya Muslims in recent months, which has uprooted a half-million people and been condemned by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, has been corroborated by many graphic accounts of killings, sexual violence and other atrocities.But a report on the Rohingya released early Thursday by Human Rights Watch, which focused on sexual violence, said that the raping of women and girls appeared to be even more widespread and systematic than earlier suspected, and that uniformed members of Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s military were responsible for it.The report was based on interviews with 52 Rohingya women and girls who had fled to neighboring Bangladesh, including 29 survivors of rape from 19 different villages in Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Rakhine State.Human Rights Watch said the report‚<U+0080><U+0099>s conclusions also drew from interviews with 17 representatives of humanitarian organizations providing health services to Rohingya women and girls in Bangladesh refugee camps, as well as Bangladeshi health officials.It found that Myanmar security forces had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>raped and sexually assaulted women and girls both during major attacks on villages but also in the weeks prior to these major attacks sometimes after repeated harassment.‚<U+0080>ùIn every case, the report said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the perpetrators were uniformed members of security forces, almost all military personnel.‚<U+0080>ùWhile Human Rights Watch did not estimate the number of rapes, it said that dozens and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sometimes hundreds of cases‚<U+0080>ù had been reported by aid groups working with refugees in the camps, and that they ‚<U+0080><U+009C>likely only represent a proportion‚<U+0080>ù of the total.‚<U+0080><U+009C>All but one of the rapes reported to Human Rights Watch were gang rapes, involving two or more perpetrators,‚<U+0080>ù the report said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In eight cases women and girls reported being raped by five or more soldiers. They described being raped in their homes and while fleeing burning villages.‚<U+0080>ùNisha Varia, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights division, said the report showed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the patterns that we were able to uncover that provide a much fuller sense of how these attacks were carried out.‚<U+0080>ùThose patterns, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>include the verification of uniformed members of security forces as perpetrators, the high incidence of gang rapes, several instances of ‚<U+0080><U+0098>mass rape,‚<U+0080><U+0099> and the patterns of sexual harassment and violence in the weeks leading up to attacks on villages.‚<U+0080>ùThe Human Rights Watch report was released against the backdrop of growing international pressure on Myanmar to stop the Rohingya persecution.It came a day after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson visited Myanmar and told its leaders to investigate ‚<U+0080><U+009C>credible reports of widespread atrocities,‚<U+0080>ù an accusation that Myanmar officials have repeatedly rejected.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Fortify Rights, an advocacy group, said in a report released Wednesday that there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>mounting evidence‚<U+0080>ù that the anti-Rohingya campaign in Myanmar amounted to genocide. The report was based on a year of research and more than 200 interviews.On Sunday, Pramila Patten, a United Nations diplomat who is the special representative on sexual violence in conflict, also suggested that the Rohingya were genocide victims and that the perpetrators should be tried at the International Criminal Court.Ms. Patten spoke after a three-day visit to the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh, where she met extensively with women and girls who had escaped the crackdown.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is an act and a weapon of genocide,‚<U+0080>ù she was quoted by Reuters as saying. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was a driver and ‚<U+0080><U+0098>push factor‚<U+0080><U+0099> for forced displacement on a massive scale, and a calculated tool of terror aimed at the extermination and removal of the Rohingya as a group.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùDREW DIXON, a former executive at Def Jam Records, who said fending off advances from the label‚<U+0080><U+0099>s co-founder Russell Simmons was a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>full-time job.‚<U+0080>ù She has accused Mr. Simmons of sexual assault.A Brooklyn grand jury has handed up an indictment in the case of an 18-year-old woman who said she was raped by two New York City police officers after they took her into custody and searched her for drugs, a person familiar with the case said on Friday.At least one of the detectives has been charged by the grand jury, which has been hearing evidence since the alleged assault on Sept. 15, said the person familiar with the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the charges have not been formally announced.Both detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, were suspended without pay on Friday, a sanction usually reserved for officers who have been charged with crimes, police officials said. They had been stripped of their guns and badges and placed on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>modified duty‚<U+0080>ù soon after the allegations emerged.But the specific charges are not expected to become public until at least early next week when the indictment is likely to be unsealed.A lawyer for the woman said she was handcuffed during the ordeal and went immediately to her mother after the officers released her without charging her with any crime, officials said. Her mother took her to Maimonides Medical Center in the Borough Park neighborhood, where she was treated. The incident spawned both the grand jury hearings and a police internal affairs investigation.The Brooklyn district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office declined to comment on whether the detectives had been charged.Mark A. Bederow, the lawyer for Detective Martins, said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are going to vigorously contest these charges in a court of law, rather than the court of public opinion.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Bederow declined further comment, including on when or whether his client might be asked to surrender to the police.John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The indictment was first reported by the New York Post on Friday.The detectives‚<U+0080><U+0099> supervisor, Sgt. John Espey, was placed on modified duty after the allegations came to light. He has not been accused of being present for any encounter between the detectives and the 18-year-old woman.Michael David, the young woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, said that the on-duty detectives had kidnapped his client off the street and attacked her while she was handcuffed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think a gang rape has ever been reported in the history of the N.Y.P.D,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said.Mr. David said the young woman was weary from waiting weeks for some sort of action by prosecutors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was getting more frustrated by the day, this has been going on for six weeks already, and it just seemed she was crying for help,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crying, she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s depressed,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said, adding that this crime has put a strain on her relationship with her parents, who have been supportive. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She spends almost the whole day in her room.‚<U+0080>ùDetectives Hall and Martins were assigned to the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit, which, about a decade ago, came under scrutiny for corruption. Hundreds of criminal cases in Brooklyn were dismissed after prosecutors and internal police investigators uncovered a scandal in which members of the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit were seizing drugs to bribe alleged criminals.More recently, the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to sweep away the scourge of drugs have led instead to scores of low-level arrests, often of street addicts in need of treatment. Such enforcement is a friction against a countervailing priority for the police: to decriminalize addiction and offer treatment rather than arrest as a way to tackle an ongoing opioids crisis that has led to increasing numbers of fatal overdoses in New York.The details of the alleged rape case have emerged in fragments and the picture remains incomplete. Mr. David said the attack occurred around 8 p.m. on a muggy Friday night. He added that the detectives were in plainclothes, in an unmarked police van, when they stopped the woman and two male friends in a car in Calvert Vaux Park in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn.Mr. David said the detectives initially searched the occupants of the car for drugs and then demanded that the woman lift her shirt.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They said, `We want to make sure there is nothing under there, so show it,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Mr. David said, recounting his client‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was petrified, so she showed it. She said, `See, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not hiding anything.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùBut the officers ordered the woman out of the car, handcuffed her and placed her into the back seat of their black Dodge van, Mr. Davis said. She was told she would be driven to the 60th Precinct station house, about a mile and a half from the park. Instead, the lawyer said, the detectives drove the woman to a parking lot of a nearby Chipotle restaurant, where they raped her.After 40 minutes, he said, the detectives took the handcuffs off the woman and released her from the van, not far from the precinct station house.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A growing national outcry over sexual harassment reached the Senate on Thursday, when a radio newscaster accused Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office.Mr. Franken, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, almost immediately released an apology to the newscaster, Leeann Tweeden, who said that Mr. Franken forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal and groped her for a photo as she slept. After initially apologizing without fully acknowledging all of her accusations, he then released another lengthier, more contrite statement that contested nothing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Franken wrote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I respect women. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t respect men who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t,‚<U+0080>ù he continued. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.‚<U+0080>ùThe storm that enveloped Mr. Franken in a matter of hours marked a merger of sorts between the harassment scandals darkening the political world and the grave misconduct marring the entertainment industry. Republicans are still struggling to resolve their quandary with Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.President Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and has refrained from weighing in on the accusations against Mr. Moore, wrote on Twitter late Thursday that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued the tweet in a cruder manner: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?‚<U+0080>ùEarlier, response from Republicans and Democrats alike was swift and unsparing. Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the Senate leaders, wasted no time before forwarding the matter to the Senate Ethics Committee ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a move supported by Democrats, including Mr. Franken. Lawmakers did stop short of meting out a punishment on a fellow senator, and it appeared that Mr. Franken would be able to weather the disclosure.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in the workplace or anywhere else.‚<U+0080>ùDemocrats gave Mr. Franken no quarter.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is unacceptable behavior and extremely disappointing. I am glad Al came out and apologized, but that doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t reverse what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done or end the matter. I support an ethics committee investigation into these accusations and I hope this latest example of the deep problems on this front spurs continued action to address it,‚<U+0080>ù said Patty Murray of Washington, one of the most senior Democratic women in the Senate.The realm of comedy, which spawned the charges against Louis C.K., has been particularly suspect, and Mr. Franken, who emerged from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù as a nationally known celebrity, appeared to acknowledge that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coming from the world of comedy, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the intentions behind my actions aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the point at all. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taken me so long to come to terms with that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Tweeden published a first-person account of the incident on KABC Radio in Los Angeles on Thursday. She wrote that it occurred in December 2006, not long before Christmas, when she was a performer for the tour alongside Mr. Franken, then a well-known comedian. Ms. Tweeden was then a Fox Sports Network correspondent and model. U.S.O. tours are meant to boost morale among American troops abroad and typically include celebrity entertainment.She also presented evidence, including a photograph of Mr. Franken, his head turned toward the camera, with his hands placed over Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breasts as she slept.According to Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, Mr. Franken wrote a bawdy script that included a kiss for the two to perform onstage. When it came time to rehearse the skit, she wrote, Mr. Franken insisted on kissing despite her protestations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be so nice about it the next time,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt disgusted and violated,‚<U+0080>ù she added.Ms. Tweeden said that no one else witnessed the kiss, and she did not tell the tour‚<U+0080><U+0099>s organizers. She said Mr. Franken retaliated against her with insults and, she learned after the trip ended, the compromising photograph.Ms. Tweeden said the photograph was taken while she was asleep on a flight back to the United States from Afghanistan and that she saw it only later, after the trip ended.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s funny?‚<U+0080>ùSpeaking on air on KABC Thursday morning, Ms. Tweeden, a former model, said that women were too often blamed for provoking male aggression based on their looks or clothing. She told reporters later that she would accept Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apology.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The apology? Sure. I accept it,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People make mistakes.‚<U+0080>ùAsked if she would call on Mr. Franken to step down, Ms. Tweeden said no, barring the emergence of new accusations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not my place,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Tweeden wrote that she had been compelled to share the story after an on-air conversation with Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, who has been a leading voice sounding alarms about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill in recent weeks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to have the same effect on them that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want them, and all the other victims of sexual assault, to be able to speak out immediately, and not keep their stories ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and their anger ‚<U+0080><U+0094> locked up inside for years, or decades.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Speier and others have labored to force Congress to begin grappling with sexual aggression that has long been a part of work life on Capitol Hill. She testified at a House hearing on the topic on Tuesday that helped draw increased scrutiny of the sort that has already begun to take place in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and newsrooms in New York and Washington.Mr. Trump has also been accused of sexual harassment. Shortly before the presidential election last year, a 2005 recording surfaced that showed Mr. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about women. The recording captured Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and bragging that he could get away with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>anything‚<U+0080>ù because of his celebrity.Others have recounted unwelcome romantic advances and unsettling workplace conduct, including at the offices of Trump Tower and backstage at beauty pageants.Even before the accusations against Mr. Franken, lawmakers in both the Senate and House had moved to begin mandatory anti-harassment training for all Capitol Hill employees and interns.Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story came one day after Ms. Speier and four other lawmakers, including Representative Ryan Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Representative Bruce Poliquin, Republican of Maine, introduced legislation to overhaul the way sexual harassment and assault are reported in Congress.Congressional aides, lawyers and lobbyists say the existing system is convoluted, and has long been stacked against those wishing to speak out against an abuser: The current process requires nondisclosure agreements and can take up to six months before a formal complaint is filed.The proposed legislation would make anonymity optional, as well as require lawmakers to reimburse the United States Treasury for paying out any settlements to victims.While his fellow senators rushed to rebuke him, Mr. Franken hunkered down out of sight, skipping four votes in the Senate and the Democrats‚<U+0080><U+0099> regularly scheduled luncheon.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fellow Minnesota Democrat, condemned his actions and like other senators called for an Ethics Committee query.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This should not have happened to Leeann Tweeden,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Klobuchar said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another example of why we need to change work environments and reporting practices across the nation, including in Congress.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Johnny Isakson, the Ethics Committee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Republican chairman, cited committee rules in saying that he could not comment on a prospective investigation.Republicans, eager to talk about sexual accusations other than Mr. Moore‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, tried to turn the allegations to their political favor. The campaign committees of Republican Senate and House candidates sent out a blizzard of news releases demanding that Democrats denounce Mr. Franken and return campaign contributions that he had made.Lisbeth Kaufman, who worked for Mr. Franken during his first term while she was in her mid-20s, said Mr. Franken never behaved inappropriately in the office to her knowledge, and recalled him as a focused and intelligent lawmaker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are predators on the Hill for sure,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kaufman, 31, said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And there are so many terrible stories. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard them myself. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve never heard such stories about Senator Franken.‚<U+0080>ùRussell Simmons has once again been accused of rape. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.In the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.The complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vehemently‚<U+0080>ù denied all of the allegations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests.‚<U+0080>ùOver the past few months, Mr. Simmons has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault or rape by multiple women, and is the focus of a police investigation in New York City. In January, an aspiring filmmaker named Jennifer Jarosik filed a $5 million lawsuit that claimed Mr. Simmons attacked her during a 2016 visit to his home. He stepped down from his companies in November.DETROIT ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A former Michigan State University dean, who supervised the doctor at the center of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, was himself charged on Tuesday with criminal sexual conduct involving medical school students.A student at the College of Osteopathic Medicine accused William Strampel, 70, of forcible sexual contact, prosecutors said in papers filed in state district court in East Lansing. Prosecutors said other students also accused Strampel of sexual misconduct.The charges emerged during a probe into how Michigan State handled complaints about the gymnastics doctor, special prosecutor William Forsyth told reporters in Lansing. The focus widened after investigators received a tip.The new charges, which Strampel's attorney denied, make the university a bigger target for the ""#MeToo"" movement that has engulfed powerful men across society in harassment and abuse allegations.""We did what we felt we needed to do and it led us to where we are today,"" Forsyth said.Strampel was dean from 2002 until the end of 2017. He supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar, who has been sentenced to prison for sexually abusing female gymnasts.The four criminal counts against Nassar's former boss include fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The accusations also include failing to properly oversee Nassar, whose scandal sparked probes into why the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and the university failed for years to investigate complaints.After a short hearing in state court in East Lansing, Strampel's attorney John Dakmak told reporters, ""My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone. He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors.""Regarding the charges relating to Strampel's supervision of Nassar, Dakmak said his client immediately involved other school officials in 2014 when the complaints surfaced and fired Nassar in 2016 when the sexual assault allegations were made.Michigan State's interim President John Engler said in a statement that one of his first actions upon his appointment in early February was moving to fire Strampel. Engler called the allegations against the former dean ""disturbing.""""Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges confirm our belief that he has fallen short of what is expected and required from academic leadership,"" Engler said.Four female medical students told investigators Strampel made sexually suggestive comments during meetings, including what some perceived as academic privileges in exchange for sex. Two accused him of grabbing their buttocks without consent.One student described meeting with Strampel in June 2017 to appeal a test score and feeling intimidated when he mentioned her age, saying: ""26-year-old women can 'put out' for 20 minutes with an old man ... and in return the women could get the benefit of a free vacation,"" according to court documents.Another witness said Strampel suggested she become a centerfold model and related to her how another student had become a stripper to pay for school, court documents said.When Strampel agreed to let the student retake a test, he said she must agree to do anything for him, which she interpreted as a request for sex, court documents said.Strampel is also accused of using his position as dean to receive pornographic images of women ""through threats and manipulation,"" court documents said. They said investigators seized his computer in February and found about 50 photos of nude women, sex toys and pornography, including selfies of female students, pornographic videos and a video of Nassar performing ""treatment"" on a young female patient.Strampel, handcuffed hands clasped in his lap and his legs crossed, appeared at his arraignment via video feed. A split screen showed him expressing little emotion as he interacted with the judge.Judge Richard Ball, citing a lack of criminal history, set a $25,000 personal recognizance bond, meaning Strampel need not post a cash bond. A preliminary hearing is set for May 3.If convicted, he faces five years and a possible fine of $10,000 for a misconduct in office charge, two years and a possible fine of $500 for the fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charge and one year and a possible fine of $1,000 for each of the two willful neglect of duty charges, according to court documents.An attorney for more than 150 of Nassar's victims said his clients were encouraged by the charges against Strampel.The charges demonstrate that officials are ""serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at MSU that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history and holding the responsible parties accountable,"" John Manly said in a statement.Michigan State has been criticized for its handling of Nassar, 54, who was a faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic. Athletes had complained about Nassar since the 1990s, but the school did not open an investigation until 2014.Nassar was fired in September 2016. He received sentences this year that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life.(Additional reporting by Rebecca Cook in East Lansing, Michigan, Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by David Gregorio)OTTAWA ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Joshua Boyle, the Canadian man who was held hostage along with his American wife in Afghanistan for five years, has been arrested and faces 15 criminal charges, court records show.The charges include sexual assault, forcible confinement, drugging and assault, and all involve events that happened after Mr. Boyle and his family returned to Canada in mid-October. Court documents show that Mr. Boyle was arrested on Monday.Since being freed by Pakistani troops along with his wife, Caitlan Coleman Boyle, and their three children who were born in captivity, Mr. Boyle has described several gruesome episodes that he said occurred during their captivity. Among other things, he said that members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network raped Ms. Coleman and killed their fourth child, an infant.Ms. Coleman Boyle has said that the captors beat their eldest son.It is still unclear why the couple took what many viewed as an exceedingly dangerous trip into an unstable region of Afghanistan during 2012.The first of the events that led to the charges Mr. Boyle now faces, according to court documents, occurred on Oct. 14, and the most recent was on Dec. 30. The charges include misleading the police.A court order prohibits the publishing of anything that might identify the two people who the Ottawa Police say were Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.The Ottawa Police declined to comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mr. Boyle is presumed innocent,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Eric Granger, wrote in an email on Tuesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s never been in trouble before. No evidence has been provided yet, which is typical at this early stage.‚<U+0080>ùAfter their release in a dramatic raid, the family initially moved in with Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario, about an hour from Ottawa. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Boyle was living in an apartment in downtown Ottawa, court records show.Mr. Boyle, 34, was previously, and briefly, married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of Omar Khadr, the only Canadian held by the United States military in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. He also acted as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s spokesman.Canadian courts found that Mr. Khadr, who was 15 when captured, was unjustly held. He was offered a formal apology by the Canadian government and agreed to a substantial monetary settlement last year. But Ms. Khadr has been widely rebuked by Canadian politicians and others for many of her public statements, including a defense of terrorism.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a dusty, overheated rehearsal room near London Bridge, things were getting ghoulish. On a mocked-up stage set, a soprano wearing a mask with black buttons over her eyeholes was slamming a fake hand into a door, trying to make it look as if it had been severed. Around a table, two ‚<U+0080><U+009C>magic consultants‚<U+0080>ù were huddled around a miniature toy theater, debating what sort of fake mice would freak audiences out the most. Eerie, discordant chords drifted from another room: A trio was practicing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doomed,‚<U+0080>ù they seemed to be singing.It was the fourth week of rehearsals for the Royal Opera‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new adaptation of Neil Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Gothic children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s novella ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù, and no bumps in the night were being left to chance. The seven singers had memorized Mark-Anthony Turnage‚<U+0080><U+0099>s angular, complex score and had worked out where to stand and walk; today was all about making sure that the supernatural transformations required by Rory Mullarkey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s libretto happened where they were meant to. The piece presented an unusual number of challenges, sighed Aletta Collins, the director: Never before had she been required to work out how to throw someone through a mirror onstage, as happens at the climax of the action, let alone how one might recruit a mouse orchestra, which pops up in Act One.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing our level best,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In the 16 years since it was published, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline,‚<U+0080>ù a tale of a plucky girl who falls into a parallel universe and battles forces from the dark side, has developed a passionate fan base, selling more than a million copies. In 2009 there came a stop-motion movie, and there have been video game and comic book adaptations, too ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even an Off Broadway musical. Propelled by this, and by the astonishing success of other stories, such as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sandman‚<U+0080>ù series and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Gods,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman has become something of a cult figure, not just among the Comic-Con crowd, but in mainstream literary circles, too.Even so, the idea of making a fantasy novel into an avant-garde opera still seems like a leap ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not only because of the mice. But then Mr. Turnage has always had eclectic taste: His last opera, which had its debut seven years ago, focused on the wayward life and tranquilizer-fueled death of Anna Nicole Smith, and his orchestral and instrumental works have gleefully referenced Miles Davis, the paintings of Francis Bacon and Beyonc√©‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Single Ladies.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>If someone says you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, or shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, then I think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a very good reason to do it,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has to provoke me, otherwise I get bored.‚<U+0080>ùThough Mr. Gaiman hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been directly involved in this new version ‚<U+0080><U+0094> earlier this month he finished shooting a screen adaptation of his novel ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Omens,‚<U+0080>ù written with Terry Pratchett ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage and Mr. Mullarkey have had plenty to play with. The novel begins when little Coraline Jones discovers that a bricked-up door in the apartment she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s just moved into is a portal to a nightmarish ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other world.‚<U+0080>ù Trapped behind the door, she finds a figure with black buttons for eyes who coos that she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other mother‚<U+0080>ù and promises her anything she desires, if only she agrees to stay ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for ever and always.‚<U+0080>ù Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s journey home to her real parents is not only a coming-of-age story; it also becomes a mythic quest.A powerful, self-determined heroine, Coraline is more than a match for operatic heroines like Leonore in Beethoven‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fidelio‚<U+0080>ù or Rosina from Rossini‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Barber of Seville.‚<U+0080>ù The role is shared in the new production by the sopranos Mary Bevan and Robyn Allegra Parton.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a strong female character,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s powerful; she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to solve these things. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got a seven-year-old daughter. S he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too young to read the book, but she saw the film, and she was very taken with Coraline.‚<U+0080>ùAlthough the opera, like the novel, is aimed at young audiences ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage has dedicated it to his daughter and his youngest son ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it goes to some genuinely disturbing places. The sense that evil lurks around every corner is palpable; there are heavy hints, too, of abuse in the plotline of parent-like figures who bribe a child to love them. While critics have often compared the book to Lewis Carroll, Mr. Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s universe is arguably closer to David Lynch or Stephen King in its atmosphere of suspenseful, what-lies-beneath horror.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted to write about how people who have your best interests at heart may not always pay you the kind of attention that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And people who pay a lot of attention to you may not always have your best interests at heart.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Collins agreed that, despite its fairy-tale qualities, this narrative is not for the fainthearted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The story is: You can have anything you want in the whole wide world, as long as you let me sew buttons into your eyes,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Turnage clearly relishes the material‚<U+0080><U+0099>s otherworldly side; the score, written for 15 musicians, is astringent and occasionally violent, bringing to mind early chamber pieces such as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>On All Fours‚<U+0080>ù (1983) and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blood on the Floor‚<U+0080>ù (1996). But ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù does allow audiences some moments of fun. The composer said he enjoyed coming up with Broadway-ish music for the character of Mr. Bobo, an eccentric old man who dwells in the apartment above Coraline and conducts the mouse orchestra. Two retired actresses who live in the apartment beneath, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, are portrayed as divas of a certain age who issue Cassandra-like pronouncements about fate in high-voltage coloratura.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The fantasy element is so heightened,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Completely operatic.‚<U+0080>ùThe Royal Opera has staged eight new operas for young people and families in the last five years, among them Julian Philips‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How the Whale Became‚<U+0080>ù (2013), based on children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stories by Ted Hughes, and Adriano Adewale‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hatch‚<U+0080>ù (2017), billed as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sensory experience for children aged 2 to 5.‚<U+0080>ù The profusion indicates how seriously the company is trying to demolish the perceived barriers that surround the art form, and to attract new and more diverse audiences.The company is under continual pressure to justify its annual governmental subsidy of around $33 million annually ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the highest of any arts institution in Britain ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and has invested in co-productions with theater and dance companies around the country. It also runs school workshops and outreach projects in towns outside London, including in some of the region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most deprived areas.Mr. Turnage, who grew up in Essex, not far from London, and was the first member of his family to get a college education, said he hoped audiences for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù would come from all walks of life. The opera world sometimes wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t as outward-facing as it should be, he suggested.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A lot of opera directors are making opera for other opera directors, and quite a few opera composers are writing for their peer group,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Although ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù has been in development for over four years, both he and Ms. Collins said that the theme of a young woman standing up for herself against the odds had acquired particular topicality in the context of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The classical world has experienced plentiful rumors about sexual harassment, along with some high-profile firings ‚<U+0080><U+0094> notably of the conductors Charles Dutoit and James Levine, who was pushed out of the Met earlier this month.Mr. Turnage said that, while some things had improved over his years in the business, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m acutely aware of women working in the opera world and the way that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re marginalized, and how tough it is. Everybody knows this.‚<U+0080>ùHe added he was proud that, as well as having created a strong female lead, the production also has a largely female creative team, led by Ms. Collins and the conductor Sian Edwards. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The world is changing,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said.He added that he hoped ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù offered a path forward, in its way. He was inspired by a quotation from G.K. Chesterton that Mr. Gaiman uses as the epigraph of the book: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fairy tales are more than true: Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.‚<U+0080>ùGov. Andrew M. Cuomo directed the state attorney general on Monday to review how the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., handled a 2015 sexual assault allegation against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Mr. Vance decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein even though his accuser, an Italian model, had provided police officers with a recording of Mr. Weinstein apologizing when she asked him why he had groped her breasts the day before.Mr. Vance said at the time that there was insufficient evidence, a defense he repeated last year after an outpouring of accusations against Mr. Weinstein reopened scrutiny of the decision, and also cast light on Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s acceptance of campaign donations from Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are confident that any review will confirm that our office has pursued its investigation without fear or favor, based on the merits alone,‚<U+0080>ù Danny Frost, a spokesman for the district attorney, said in a statement on Monday evening. He said the office would provide the attorney general with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any necessary information.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement of the investigation, which will be conducted by Eric T. Schneiderman, came hours after Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up, the star-powered organization dedicated to fighting sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond, wrote a letter to the governor calling on him to open an investigation into Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is of great concern that sexual assault cases have not been pursued with full vigor by our criminal justice system,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement also came the same day that Cynthia Nixon, an actress and education activist, announced her candidacy for governor; Ms. Nixon, a Democrat, is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the left.Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office is currently investigating other claims against Mr. Weinstein, including that he twice raped the actress Paz de la Huerta. Mr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said the review of Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case would not interfere with those open investigations, which he said would conclude within about 45 days. Afterward, the statement said, Mr. Schneiderman would review the entire matter and decide if further action was warranted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are deeply familiar with Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s years of egregious sexual abuse, and recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against him alleging severe and persistent abuse of employees at The Weinstein Company,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are committed to pursuing a full, fair and independent review of this matter.‚<U+0080>ùReports of possible conflicts of interest between Mr. Vance and Mr. Weinstein have circulated since last October, when a deluge of accusations against Mr. Weinstein, once one of Hollywood‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful producers, sparked an international reckoning around sexual abuse. Two of the lawyers Mr. Weinstein retained after being brought in for questioning about his encounters with Ms. Battilana had personal and financial ties to Mr. Vance: Elkan Abramowitz was a former law partner of Mr. Vance and a donor to his campaign, and Daniel S. Connolly was a former prosecutor turned white-collar defense lawyer.Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers also brought on Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor and close friend of the head of the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex crimes bureau, as a consultant; she facilitated an introduction between Mr. Abramowitz and the bureau head, Martha Bashford.And David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein who hired a private investigative firm to dig up information in an attempt to stop The New York Times‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expose on his client, has given $55,000 to Mr. Vance over the years. Mr. Boies has said he never spoke to Mr. Vance about any criminal investigation of Mr. Weinstein.In Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, Ms. Bashford determined after two weeks of investigation that she could not prove the crime of forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse had been committed, even though she had the audio tape, Mr. Vance has said. Prosecutors judged it would be hard to prove Mr. Weinstein touched Ms. Battilana for sexual reasons because the advance came as the two were talking about Ms. Battilana becoming a lingerie model and whether her bosom had been surgically enhanced.Prosecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to pursue charges, and it is not uncommon for assistant district attorneys not to see eye-to-eye with detectives on the strength of a case. But the tensions over Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision in the case have exploded in recent months into an open feud between some detectives in the Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s special victims unit and the district attorney.For detectives, assembling enough evidence to establish that it is probable someone committed a crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known in law as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>probable cause‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is enough to make an arrest. Prosecutors, however, must take things further and prove every element of the crime in court, and that can often be a much higher bar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The police have a job to do, and we have a job to do, and they are very different jobs,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Vance said in an interview Monday night. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our job is to ensure that any case that we bring has proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard we have to meet in court. Any other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes. If you are trying cases where you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have the proof, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not going to be a satisfactory outcome for the survivor.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Vance also issued a joint statement with the police commissioner, James P. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Neill, in which he called his office and the Police Department ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fully committed partners in the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>From time to time we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have our disagreements, but we will never allow them to undermine this shared endeavor,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.Since its inception a quarter century ago, the independent city agency that investigates allegations of police abuse in New York City has done nothing more with complaints about sexual misconduct than send them to the Police Department. In the 18 months ending last June, 117 such allegations were funneled to the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internal Affairs Bureau, where findings remain hidden and any discipline of officers is cloaked in administrative secrecy.Now, however, as allegations about a wide spectrum of sexual misconduct ‚<U+0080><U+0094> from inappropriate comments to workplace coercion to sexual abuse and rape ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are roiling the country, the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, has added a layer of oversight to allegations of sexual harassment and abuse in policing.In a board meeting on Wednesday it adopted  a resolution from its staff to immediately investigate certain allegations of sexual misconduct by officers against civilians, such as lewd comments or gestures, snapping unwanted photographs or sexually humiliating or ticketing civilians if they rebuff flirtations like a blown kiss. The vote was unanimous, with three board members appointed by the police commissioner joining seven others appointed by the mayor or City Council.Later, it hopes to broaden that mandate and select a group of specially trained, senior investigators to handle the most serious allegations, including rape, though not before it builds up a budget and some expertise in helping survivors of traumatic sexual violence by officers.That next phase must be done carefully, to ensure that, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the procedures we put in place do not negatively impact the complainants and also don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t impact potential criminal investigations,‚<U+0080>ù Jonathan Darche, the executive director of the board, told board members at the meeting.In a memo outlining its rationale, the staff of the agency said there is little in the arena of abuse by sworn, armed law enforcement officers that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>undermines society‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confidence in the police more than an officer who wields the badge as a tool of sexual intimidation and coercion.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unfortunately,‚<U+0080>ù it went on, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the question is not whether such misconduct occurs. Rather, C.C.R.B. must investigate how often it occurs and what can be done to stop it.‚<U+0080>ùOutside watchdogs of the New York City police immediately embraced the idea as necessary and long overdue. The C.C.R.B. was formed in 1993 with a mandate by the City Charter to investigate four types of misconduct allegations: force; abuse of authority; discourtesy; and offensive language. It said in its memo that allegations of sexual misconduct by officers fall clearly under its power to look into cases of officers abusing their authority, though some cases might also involve discourtesy, offensive language or force.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s any surprise here, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s that the C.C.R.B. is only now getting to the point where it recognizes that sexual harassment by N.Y.P.D. officers is something the board has to be dealing with,‚<U+0080>ù Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the board before its vote, in Lower Manhattan. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I am glad you are confronting it now.‚<U+0080>ùFor allegations of criminal sexual conduct, the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo called for a new policy allowing the board to notify the appropriate district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a step beyond its current practice of only notifying the Internal Affairs Bureau ‚<U+0080><U+0094> though it said the high burden of proof in such cases means prosecutors often cannot or will not pursue them.Andrew Case, a lawyer who was a spokesman for the review board, said he worries ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that if these cases, particularly forcible assaults, fall to C.C.R.B., then that would be a sign that D.A.s are not doing all they can to investigate truly criminal acts.‚<U+0080>ùNew York state law does not explicitly forbid sexual contact between police officers and people in their custody, though it forbids such conduct by correction and parole officers. The New York State Assembly last week passed legislation to prevent police officers from escaping legal consequences of an alleged sexual assault by saying arrestees consented, and the State Senate is now considering the same measure. The New York City Council is also considering legislation that would make it a misdemeanor crime for police officers to have sexual contact with people in custody.The 117 allegations of sexual misconduct the board referred to the Internal Affairs Bureau between January 2016 and June ‚<U+0080><U+009C>included a variety of allegations, from catcalls and sexual propositions to unwanted touching and rape,‚<U+0080>ù the memo said. It summarized three of them to provide a range of cases the board receives.In one, a woman questioned by a Bronx detective in 2014, at a shooting scene, went on to repeatedly encounter the same man around the neighborhood ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and recalled that he would regularly lick his lips and make lewd expressions toward her,‚<U+0080>ù the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo said. In 2016, as she was held in a station house jail cell on a driving charge, the same detective entered her cell and made a profane gesture and a reference to oral sex.In another, a man alleged that an officer twice squeezed his genitals during a frisk last year that followed a street stop for jaywalking.The Police Department declined to answer questions about any discipline handed down to officers in the 117 complaints referred to its Internal Affairs Bureau, how the cases were decided or what the complaints alleged. It said it would work with the review board to implement the new procedure.For all review board referrals to the Internal Affairs Bureau, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a huge issue‚<U+0080>ù is that the police ‚<U+0080><U+009C>don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t tell us what happens with any of them,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Case said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One of the things this speaks to, a broader issue, is reporting from I.A.B. to C.C.R.B. about all referrals.‚<U+0080>ùWASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has argued for weeks that Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, should leave the race, said on Sunday that he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>going to let the people of Alabama make the call.‚<U+0080>ùAsked during an appearance on ABC News‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This Week‚<U+0080>ù whether he thought Mr. Moore, who has been accused of preying on teenage girls, should be in the Senate, Mr. Connell said the decision should be left to the Dec. 12 special election.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This election has been going on a long time,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There has been a lot of discussion about it. They are going to make the decision a week from Tuesday.‚<U+0080>ùIn the past, Mr. McConnell had said that he was looking at drafting a write-in candidate for the election, and that if Mr. Moore, a Republican, won the race, he would support a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the allegations against him.But on Sunday, Mr. McConnell seemed to accept that Mr. Moore, who has denied the allegations, would not be stepping down with only days remaining before the vote.Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Mr. McConnell, said the senator was not backing down from any earlier comments about Mr. Moore. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The leader did not change or retract any of his previous statements,‚<U+0080>ù she said in an email on Sunday.Mr. McConnell told ABC News that he still believed that the Ethics Committee should investigate the allegations against Mr. Moore.Several women have accused Mr. Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior. They said they had been subjected to groping, forcible kissing or other unwanted advances when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor in his 30s.Mr. McConnell noted on Sunday that two decades ago, when he was the chairman of the Ethics Committee, he had recommended the expulsion of Senator Bob Packwood, the powerful Oregon Republican, who resigned in 1995 after he was accused of sexual harassment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Senate has been very sensitive to these matters for a long time, and the Senate Ethics Committee will handle this in the regular order way that we do this in the Senate,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m confident they will come up with the right conclusion.‚<U+0080>ùA prominent donor to the Democratic Party says she is considering withdrawing support for senators who urged their colleague Al Franken to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct.The donor, Susie Tompkins Buell, has been one of the Democratic Party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most generous supporters for decades. In particular, she has been a champion of female politicians, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Maria Cantwell of Washington.Last month, those senators were among the dozens who called for Mr. Franken to resign from the Senate after at least six women accused him of sexual harassment or misconduct, such as forcible kissing and groping.Mr. Franken announced his resignation on Dec. 7 before the Senate Ethics Committee had completed a review of the accusations, which he disputed.Before he was elected to the Senate to represent Minnesota in 2008, Mr. Franken, a Democrat, was a well-known comedian and a cast member on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live.‚<U+0080>ù After he resigned, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith of Minnesota was named as his replacement.Ms. Buell said in a text message on Saturday that withdrawing support from the senators who called for his resignation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an option‚<U+0080>ù she was considering.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In my gut they moved too fast,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote, adding that Mr. Franken ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was never given his chance to tell his side of the story.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me this is dangerous and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a big believer in helping more women into the political system but this has given me an opportunity to rethink of how I can best help my party.‚<U+0080>ùShe is a friend of Hillary Clinton‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and has spoken in support of Ms. Gillibrand, who led the charge in the Senate to urge Mr. Franken to leave.In her text, Ms. Buell said she did not know Mr. Franken personally but had met him a couple of times and was impressed by his work as a senator.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As for Gillibrand, unfortunately, I believe she miscalculated and has shot herself in the foot,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have supported her for many years. Will I going forward? To be determined.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Buell, of San Francisco, was a founder of the clothing brand Esprit and has spent decades fund-raising and donating millions of dollars for liberal causes and candidates. Her Susie Tompkins Buell Foundation has awarded grants to organizations supporting climate change education, a free press and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights.In 2016, Ms. Buell contributed money to help a woman who had accused President Trump of harassment, she said, adding that the money was not used and was refunded. The New York Times reported last month that she was said to have donated $500,000 to support accusers, but Ms. Buell would not confirm the amount.Her comments about the senators who called for Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation were reported by BuzzFeed.A spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand did not respond directly to Ms. Buell but pointed to the senator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook post on Dec. 6, in which she urged Mr. Franken to resign.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have to rise to the occasion, and not shrink away from it, even when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard, especially when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is what this larger moment is about. So, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on Senator Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. Enough is enough. The women who have come forward are brave and I believe them.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Gillibrand added that the allegations against Mr. Franken were not equal to the harassment and assault accusations against the Hollywood filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, the Alabama politician Roy S. Moore and Mr. Trump. She has called for Mr. Trump to resign. In response, he wrote in a tweet that she was a lightweight ‚<U+0080><U+009C>who would come to my office ‚<U+0080><U+0098>begging‚<U+0080><U+0099> for campaign contributions not so long ago.‚<U+0080>ùThis past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Steven Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new movie, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Crown‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life with quick, grim strokes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ostensibly because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a suicide risk ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s who and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t belong in the hospital but doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help her case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Carrie‚<U+0080>ù) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Shining,‚<U+0080>ù another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich√©s and sadism and just read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crickets‚<U+0080>ù is slang for critics, but maybe the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.BOSTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A state senator's husband was indicted Thursday on charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos without consent and criminal lewdness.The indictment of Bryon Hefner, the husband of Democratic Sen. Stanley Rosenberg, came months after The Boston Globe reported on allegations that Hefner sexually harassed or abused several men, some of whom had business before the Legislature.Prosecutors said Hefner sexually assaulted three victims between 2014 and 2016. They said he also obtained nude and partially nude photos of another victim without that victim's knowledge and sent or showed the photos to other people.""Today's indictments on multiple felony charges send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,"" Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. ""I want to thank the victims who have come forward and put their trust in us.""Hefner's attorney said he ""intends to plead not guilty and looks forward to contesting the evidence and confronting the witnesses against him in a court of law.""Hefner is set to be arraigned on April 24 in Suffolk Superior Court, prosecutors said.Rosenberg, who is separated from Hefner, said these are ""serious charges.""""They are now being handled by the judicial system,"" he said in a statement. ""I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.""Rosenberg, who's in his late 60s, announced in January that he had separated from Hefner, who's 30, and that Hefner had entered treatment for alcohol dependency.Democratic state Senate President Harriette Chandler, who replaced Rosenberg as president, called the charges ""deeply disturbing.""""Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the District Attorney and Attorney General's Office,"" she said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, both Republicans, said they ""commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.""The initial reports that several men had accused Hefner of sexual assault or harassment sent the chamber into turmoil late last year, resulting in Rosenberg's decision to step down.The Senate Ethics Committee voted to hire a Boston law firm to independently investigate whether Rosenberg violated any Senate rules in connection with the allegations. That probe is ongoing.Rosenberg, a state senator since 1991, had initially hoped to return as president once the investigation was completed, but pressure mounted on senators to move on after the Globe subsequently reported that Hefner had involved himself in matters before the Senate. That included having access to Rosenberg's email account, despite Rosenberg's earlier promise to keep a ""firewall"" between his professional and personal lives.A lawyer for Hefner said at the time that Hefner ""did not have independent access to his husband's official email.""Rosenberg has repeatedly said that Hefner did not influence his actions and decisions as Senate president.Rosenberg assumed the top leadership post in January 2015. He was the first openly gay leader of either legislative chamber in Massachusetts.Democratic state Sen. Karen Spilka last week announced that she had secured commitments from enough of her colleagues to become the next Senate president, essentially ending any hope of Rosenberg's return as president. Rosenberg continues to serve as senator.When Chandler, who's 80, took over after Rosenberg's decision to step down, she said she intended to serve as president only through the remainder of this year.___Associated Press writers Bob Salsberg and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.OKLAHOMA CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed Wednesday that it is looking into a lawsuit's allegations that a middle school student was sexually assaulted and threatened by classmates over 18 months and that school officials did nothing to stop the attacks.The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Oklahoma City by the now 14-year-old boy and his parents, alleges that Superintendent A.J. Brewer and Principal Stuart McPherson of Washington Public Schools, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City treated the assaults as ""horseplay"" or ""accidental touching.""The OSBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations should be finished soon, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.""We should have our reports completed in a few weeks. We will then hand it over to the district attorney. The DA will then determine how to proceed,"" and whether criminal charges are warranted, Brown said.School attorney Andy Fugitt said Wednesday that he was aware of the lawsuit but that he could not comment on pending litigation.Under Oklahoma law, anyone who suspects a child under the age of 18 is being abused is required to report the suspicion to the state's Department of Human Services.According to the lawsuit, DHS was notified of the allegations in May 2017, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation began investigating in November at the request of the Washington Police Department.DHS spokeswoman Sheree Powell said the agency is prohibited by state and federal law from confirming any investigation.""We don't or confirm investigations involving particular allegations or individuals,"" Powell said.The lawsuit comes after four former football players in the Tulsa suburb of Bixby were previously charged with sexually assaulting a teammate that prosecutors said wasn't promptly reported.The four have pleaded not guilty and their attorneys have asked that the each be certified as juveniles.An Associated Press investigation published in 2017 examined sexual violence in school sports as part of a larger look at student-on-student sex assaults. The investigation found that team sexual assault is often mischaracterized as hazing and bullying and that the violence is so normalized that it persists for years, as players attacked one season become aggressors the next.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The British actress Minnie Driver, who recently resigned from her role as an Oxfam ambassador after revelations of sexual misconduct by staff members at the charity, said on Tuesday that the conversation around sexual assault should be based on a model similar to a truth and reconciliation commission to heal wounds and move forward.Ms. Driver, known for her roles in movies like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù was speaking at a London event focused on the #MeToo movement and organized by The New York Times and the How To Academy. Here are highlights of the interview.She spoke at length about comments made by Matt Damon, a former boyfriend, who said that alleged sexual misdeeds by powerful men involved a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>spectrum of behavior.‚<U+0080>ù Speaking on ABC News in December, Mr. Damon had said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be conflated.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver said that Mr. Damon ‚<U+0080><U+009C>represented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, she said men needed to be included in the conversation about sexual assault because ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no way to move forward unless we do this together.‚<U+0080>ù Use the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>model of truth and reconciliation,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to courtlike commissions set up after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda or apartheid in South Africa, where the judicial bodies were tasked with revealing wrongdoing in hopes of healing wounds.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Women get to be heard,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to metabolize that and then there is due process and then there is healing.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, the deputy chief executive of Oxfam resigned in the wake of accusations that the British charity had covered up misconduct by its staff members after revelations that aid workers had hired prostitutes in crisis zones in Chad and Haiti.Ms. Driver, who was affiliated with the organization for 20 years ‚<U+0080><U+0094> her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>longest relationship with anyone,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> announced last week that she was resigning from her role as a celebrity ambassador. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It broke my heart in so many ways,‚<U+0080>ù she said, particularly because she had been primarily involved in programs that were helping prostitutes in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam to retrain and rebuild their lives. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cut me to the very heart of what I had been involved with,‚<U+0080>ù she said.She added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I needed to send a very clear message, not to the beautiful people that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked with on the ground for so many years who are amazing and industrious, but to the corporation that knew, corporate people who knew this was going on. Who hush-hushed it. Who were not transparent about it, either with me or the people that worked for them, and who didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything about it.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver recounted her experience with Mr. Weinstein, the disgraced mogul who produced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù in which she plays an erudite Harvard graduate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cast me,‚<U+0080>ù she said, because he told her and the casting director that she was not attractive enough to have sex with. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got off lightly with him. I really did,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we talk about sexual harassment, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not about sex, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s about power.‚<U+0080>ùThe inhabitants of the derelict mansion in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lodgers‚<U+0080>ù don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get out much. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s script, the director Brian O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins‚<U+0080><U+0099> birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a measure of this movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insistently fright-free storytelling that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Edward. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dracula,‚<U+0080>ù as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers.Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chilling effect‚<U+0080>ù on campus sexual assault investigations.Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them.In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus.A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation.Under Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations.Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases.The Obama-era guidance, issued in 2011 and 2014, reinforced the obligation of colleges and universities to respond to sexual assault claims and was widely hailed as strengthening protections for accusers amid increasing evidence that those institutions were skirting their responsibilities to investigate sexual misconduct. But it was widely assailed by men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights and conservative civil liberties groups as heavily biased against the accused.In an extensive policy speech announcing the new guidance, Ms. DeVos outlined what she described as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>failed system‚<U+0080>ù that violated students‚<U+0080><U+0099> due process rights and lacked public confidence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. DeVos said in September. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.‚<U+0080>ùMs. DeVos issued interim guidance that raised the standard of proof for accusers to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>clear and convincing evidence‚<U+0080>ù from a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>preponderance of evidence‚<U+0080>ù and allowed cases to be settled in mediation sessions between the accuser and the accused. It also dropped time frames for completing investigations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new policy discriminates against women and girls and makes it harder for them to learn in a safe environment,‚<U+0080>ù said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center, which is representing the litigants in the suit.The plaintiffs in the suit, Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice and the Victim Rights Law Center, all advise or represent people who say they were sexually assaulted. The groups are being represented by Equal Rights Advocates, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Center for Youth Law and the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center.In the complaint, SurvJustice said that the group had not only seen ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a decrease in the number of sexual violence survivors seeking its services,‚<U+0080>ù but also observed a trend in educational institutions not responding at all, or not responding as promptly to its clients‚<U+0080><U+0099> complaints.The group also wrote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>students who have questioned whether they should continue with their plans to report sexual violence given the uncertainty regarding their legal protections and an anticipated lowered likelihood of success created by the policy change.‚<U+0080>ùThe Victims Rights Law Center, which focuses its efforts on rape and sexual assault, said Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s guidance was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating‚<U+0080>ù to its mission and operational activities.The groups are asking that the guidance be rescinded as unlawful.‚<U+0080><U+009C>With each day that passes, this discriminatory policy will continue to cause harm to survivors of sexual harassment and violence,‚<U+0080>ù said Alice Y. Abrokwa, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law.In their complaint, the groups wrote that Ms. DeVos and her acting leader of civil rights, Candice Jackson, made statements that revealed their bias against accusers.They cited Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy address during which she asserted that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>if everything is harassment, then nothing is,‚<U+0080>ù and Ms. Jackson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal of women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fake victims.‚<U+0080>ùSAN ANTONIO ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  In October of 2016, not long after a sexual assault scandal at Baylor swept out the football coach, athletic director and president of the university, the NCAA convened a commission to combat campus sexual violence.The commission crafted a policy focused on educating athletes and coaches and ensuring athletic departments were following school policies regarding the handling of sexual assault allegations. The commission's proposal was adopted by the NCAA board of governors last year .Since then, Michigan State has become embroiled in a horrific scandal involving a former athletic department doctor, Larry Nassar, who has been convicted of molesting dozens of women, including many Spartans athletes.NCAA leaders see the association as an agent of culture change, trying to curb a problem that goes beyond athletics. Others want the NCAA to take a more active role, putting rules in place that would ban individual offenders from competing in college athletics and sanction schools that fail to weed out potential predators. That is highly unlikely.""This is a systemic issue in society and certainly on campuses regardless of whether it's student-athletes or not,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday at the Alamodome, site of Saturday's Final Four. ""On that score, the NCAA and the Board of Governors in particular have been more engaged than any other higher education entity. In fact, we're providing leadership to the rest of higher ed right now on trying to figure out how to deal with these issues in advance and prevent them, rather than just always coming in after the fact and imposing some kind of punishment or solutions afterwards.""Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor and activist who speaks to college sports teams all over the country, is part of the NCAA's commission to combat campus sexual assault. Tracy was encouraged by the passing of the commission's recommendations by NCAA Board of Governors in August . But she is pushing for an NCAA ban on athletes who commit sexual violence.""I don't feel like anyone should be banned from their education,"" Tracy said. ""But I do think that playing sports is absolutely a privilege and not a right. It's a privilege to be an NCAA athlete. To be a scholarship athlete.""Tracy said because of the prestige that goes with being an athlete, especially in high-profile sports such as football and basketball, they have more influence on campus.""And so we have a duty and a responsibility to make sure we're driving conversations that effect attitudes and beliefs and how we view these issues correctly,"" she said. ""And we're not. We're basically saying if you can run fast enough and throw a ball and make enough money for a school or a sports program then you can do whatever you want. You can break a woman's face. You can stomp her. You can rape her. You can do whatever you want as long as you're a good enough athlete. And that's wrong.""And so I also talk to them about, you know, what about attaching eligibility to behavior. You attach it to grades. Why can't we say sexual assault is not OK. Domestic violence is not OK.""For the NCAA, stepping into the area of what it refers to as individual accountability is complicated territory.""You quickly recognize that there are other entities that hold individuals accountable for criminal acts per se or even for violations of Title IX on specific campuses when investigations are completed,"" NCAA chief legal officer Don Remy said. ""And so as we have looked at this we have looked at our role as composed of all of higher education. And how can we in college athletics be part of the higher education dialogue to change the culture. And how can we make sure that student-athletes are treated the same as students who are on campus who don't compete in athletics. Not to create any preferential treatment for student-athletes or to create a negative environment for student-athletes, but to have student-athletes be able to matriculate through their time on campus like other students who aren't competing in athletics.""Kathy Redmond, founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, said at the heart of the problem is athletes are often given preferential treatment and protection by athletic programs, boosters and even local enforcement when they are accused of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. Redmond called the sexual violence policy the NCAA passed last year a ""check-the-box"" measure.""But when it comes down to it, the individual players know that the system will work for them,"" she said.Redmond said the NCAA should use a proposal crafted by the Drake Group , a watchdog for college sports, to guide policy on sexual violence committed by athletes.Tracy would like the NCAA to adopt a policy similar to the one Indiana University implemented last year, which bans its teams from accepting any athletes with a documented history of sexual or domestic violence. IU's policy was inspired by a similar one implemented by the Southeastern Conference regarding transfers.Though Indiana athletic director Fred Glass said: ""We didn't implement it to be like a trailblazer or pulling people toward this policy.""Laws differ from state to state, down to definitions of sexual assault. A one-size fits all NCAA policy that bans athletes with past transgressions would be difficult to craft and possibly vulnerable to legal challenges.""What is that a life sentence?"" said Cleveland-based attorney Susan Stone, who represented Ma'Lik Richmond, the Youngstown State football player convicted of rape in juvenile court when he was in high school.Campus backlash prompted Youngstown State to ban Richmond from playing last season. He sued the school, which had no policy like Indiana's. The school settled and lifted the ban.""There needs to be some thought before you ostracize students,"" Stone said.Tracy said she is not just looking to punish wrongdoers.""We're not just failing survivors, but we're also failing these young men, too,"" she said. ""Especially with our athletes the way we place entitlement on them from a young age. The way we set them up for failure by protecting them from everything. All this stuff that we do with our athletes, we're not helping them.""___Follow Ralph D.

The once-beloved comedian and television star has been accused by more than 50 women of sexual assault going back decades.Only one of those accusations was recent enough to prosecute. Cosby, 80, is charged with drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, 44, at his home near Philadelphia between Dec. 30, 2003, and Jan. 20, 2004. Jury selection is due to start on Monday.Cosby, best known as the wise and witty dad in the 1980s TV hit ""The Cosby Show,"" has denied criminal wrongdoing, saying any sexual contact he had was consensual.Cosby's first trial ended in June with a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict following six days of deliberations.Cosby, who now walks with a cane and has poor vision, sat at the defense table on Thursday for the first of two days of pre-trial arguments, with the defense and prosecution clashing over what witnesses and evidence the jury should be allowed to see.Cosby's defense team sought the judge's recusal because his wife, Dr. Deborah O'Neill, is a psychotherapist at Penn who coordinates a group that helps sexual assault victims. She made a $100 donation to a feminist group at the University of Pennsylvania sponsoring the annual V-Day activities, which include a production of the play ""The Vagina Monologues.""O'Neill dismissed the request, saying, ""She's an independent woman and has a right to be involved in anything she believes in.""Prosecutors want to quash any mention of a 2005 press release in which former District Attorney Bruce Castor announced that he would not prosecute Cosby, and of how current District Attorney Kevin Steele later decided to file charges.Defense lawyers want the jury to hear from Margo Jackson, who they say will testify that she heard Constand say she could make money on a sexual assault accusation against a celebrity.In the first trial, O'Neill ruled Jackson's testimony was inadmissible as hearsay but now he is reconsidering.The pre-trial hearing was due to resume on Friday morning.Jury selection is to begin on Monday, with the jury pool being sequestered starting on Sunday night, O'Neill said.(Reporting by David DeKok Writing by Daniel Trotta Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Trott)A star University of Minnesota basketball player announced Thursday that he would not appeal a university ruling expelling him for sexual assault, effectively ending his college career.The university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action had found Reggie Lynch, 23, a senior, responsible for violating the university code over two incidents. In one case, the sentence was suspension; in the second, expulsion.Lynch played with the Gophers during investigations into the incidents, which dated back more than a year, but he was suspended from play last month when the first decision was made public.At a news conference on Thursday, Lynch insisted upon his innocence and blamed a national atmosphere that is unfair to those accused of sexual misdeeds for his downfall. In recent months, accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men have stirred new interest in combating such behavior.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, people will automatically assume that you are guilty if any accusations have been made,‚<U+0080>ù Lynch said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I feel scared that in today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, this is the world we live in today. I am angry that there is no real way to defend myself.‚<U+0080>ùA university spokesman confirmed Lynch was no longer an active student.Lynch was previously suspended from the team over the summer of 2016, after he was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a third woman. In that case, prosecutors did not charge him and a university investigation cleared him of responsibility.A center, Lynch was a standout for the Gophers last season, his junior year, winning the Big Ten‚<U+0080><U+0099>s defensive player of the year honors as Minnesota went 24-10 and made the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time under Coach Richard Pitino.This season, the Gophers are 14-14. Lynch had not played since Jan. 3.Lynch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Marlene, who appeared alongside her son and his lawyer on Thursday, specifically blamed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the current political climate at the U‚<U+0080>ù for what she characterized as an injustice done to her son.In late 2016, Minnesota football players threatened to boycott a bowl game to protest the suspensions of several teammates for their alleged involvement in a sexual assault. That brought national attention to the university, prompting the president, Eric W. Kaler, to vow a renewed initiative to combat sexual assault.Some sexual encounters are obviously consensual, while others are obviously not. But what about those that are neither black nor white? In the second episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars plunge deeper into the gray area.A woman who calls herself ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stuck in the Gray‚<U+0080>ù is still haunted by her first sexual encounter over a decade later. At age 22, she lost her virginity to her brother-in-law, who is 11 years her senior. The encounter had lasting repercussions on her sex life and her relationship with her family, especially her sister, her brother-in-law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife. Stuck in the Gray struggled to define the encounter for years and now she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unable to conclude if it was consensual. She asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I a coward and a liar who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hiding my accountability behind victimization?

He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an enemy of the state, a man of God and the great hero of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Power and the Glory.‚<U+0080>ù Father Frank Docherty, the protagonist of Thomas Keneally‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new novel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crimes of the Father,‚<U+0080>ù is a bad priest to some and a good one to others, and he certainly knows it. Sent away from his native Sydney in 1972 by an archbishop who found Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political activism and theological liberalism unacceptable, he is by the 1990s a psychologist and a professor in Canada. Under those auspices, he researches the sexual abuse of children and minors by the clergy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew the suspicion he attracted from his brethren in the wider priesthood. He was a priest who ponced around academia all week, dealing with unhealthy and distasteful subjects, and helped out at a local parish on the weekend ‚<U+0080><U+0094> how graceful of him!‚<U+0080>ùFor his 36th novel, Keneally has chosen a subject that is by now painfully familiar to both Roman Catholics and the wider public. The main action takes place in Sydney in 1996 and concerns the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding Irish population. This is a time and place and community in which those abused are just beginning to come forward more boldly, while church leaders and the faithful more broadly are themselves only just starting to reckon more openly with longstanding patterns of institutional failure, corruption and concealment. As he returns to Sydney to lecture on his research, resume complicated friendships and seek permission from the current archbishop to celebrate Mass again in his native archdiocese, Docherty becomes involved in an intertwined series of private and public revelations.For obvious reasons, Keneally admires his protagonist. As such, Docherty is not especially interesting, for he rarely seems genuinely unsure of himself. Whether he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preparing to confront an elite clergyman and his superior with evidence of the clergyman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse or trying to deal with once strong, now reheated feelings for a married woman, his struggles come across as stylized, even romantically heroic. You can be damned sure, mate, that tough-and-tender ol‚<U+0080><U+0099> Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to do the difficult thing, and do it well, no matter the odds.The novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far more distinctive and well-wrought character is Sarah Fagan, the Sydney cabdriver who picks up Docherty at the airport upon his return. Through intensely told flashback sequences, Keneally brings out the confusion and pain teenage Sarah experiences when she comes under the influence of Father Leo Shannon, a rising young star in the archdiocese. Under the guise of hiring her as his office assistant, Shannon makes Fagan feel privileged, even blessed, to spend secret time doing secret things with him. When he coolly rejects her for other girls, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she felt the jolt of this news, and a sickening bewilderment in the pit of her stomach; the extreme sentiments of the rejected.‚<U+0080>ùFrom this brilliant, brutal rendering of Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victimization, Keneally traces out her jagged trajectory through a convent childhood, university studies, a teaching career and assorted vocational and spiritual spinouts, and finally into her very tentative alliance with Docherty. This last happens to coincide with Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confrontation with Shannon himself, now a key adviser to the archbishop in legal proceedings concerning another abuse case. The heroism and villainy that play out thereafter is suspenseful, if predictable. Far more powerfully felt is Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unexpected expression of thanks to Docherty, near the novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end, for a favor he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done her, which has made possible both personal renewal and public justice. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What favor is that?‚<U+0080>ù the priest asks. Her answer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You believed me.‚<U+0080>ùJust one day after Hollywood offered a show of support for the #MeToo movement on the Golden Globes red carpet and stage, a famous actress on the other side of the Atlantic lent her name to a public letter denouncing the movement, as well as its French counterpart, #Balancetonporc, or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Expose Your Pig.‚<U+0080>ùCatherine Deneuve joined more than 100 other Frenchwomen in entertainment, publishing and academic fields Tuesday in the pages of the newspaper Le Monde and on its website in arguing that the two movements, in which women and men have used social media as a forum to describe sexual misconduct, have gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and have created a totalitarian climate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is a crime. But insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression,‚<U+0080>ù the letter, dated Monday, begins. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As a result of the Weinstein affair, there has been a legitimate realization of the sexual violence women experience, particularly in the workplace, where some men abuse their power. It was necessary. But now this liberation of speech has been turned on its head.‚<U+0080>ùThey contend that the #MeToo movement has led to a campaign of public accusations that have placed undeserving people in the same category as sex offenders without giving them a chance to defend themselves. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This expedited justice already has its victims, men prevented from practicing their profession as punishment, forced to resign, etc., while the only thing they did wrong was touching a knee, trying to steal a kiss, or speaking about ‚<U+0080><U+0098>intimate‚<U+0080><U+0099> things at a work dinner, or sending messages with sexual connotations to a woman whose feelings were not mutual,‚<U+0080>ù they write. The letter, written in French was translated here by The New York Times.The passage appears to refer to the some of the names on a growing list of men who have been suspended, fired or forced to resign after having been accused of sexual misconduct in the last several months.One of the arguments the writers make is that instead of empowering women, the #MeToo and #BalanceTonPorc movements instead serve the interests of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the enemies of sexual freedom, of religious extremists, of the worst reactionaries,‚<U+0080>ù and of those who believe that women are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0098>separate‚<U+0080><U+0099> beings, children with the appearance of adults, demanding to be protected.‚<U+0080>ù They write that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman can, in the same day, lead a professional team and enjoy being the sexual object of a man, without being a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>promiscuous woman,‚<U+0080><U+0099> nor a vile accomplice of patriarchy.‚<U+0080>ùThey believe that the scope of the two movements represses sexual expression and freedom. After describing requests from publishers to make male characters ‚<U+0080><U+009C>less sexist‚<U+0080>ù and a Swedish bill that will require people to give explicit consent before engaging in sexual activity, the women write, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One more effort and two adults who will want to sleep together will first check, through an app on their phone, a document in which the practices they accept and those they refuse will be duly listed.‚<U+0080>ùThey continue, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The philosopher Ruwen Ogien defended the freedom to offend as essential to artistic creation. In the same way, we defend a freedom to bother, indispensable to sexual freedom.‚<U+0080>ù Though the writers do not draw clear lines between what constitutes sexual misconduct and what does not, they say that they are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sufficiently farseeing not to confuse a clumsy come-on and sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ùTranslations of the letter were quickly picked up by Twitter on Tuesday, and responses ranged from supportive to hostile. Asia Argento, an actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the Frenchwomen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter on Twitter.On the other side of the spectrum, Christina Hoff Sommers, who coined the term ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victim feminism,‚<U+0080>ù tweeted a quote from the letter and her remarks on it.In France, tens of thousands of stories have landed on social media under the hashtag #Balancetonporc since the journalist Sandra Muller used it in October in a post on Twitter about an inappropriate come-on she received from a French executive.The multitude of revelations in France has led to discussion of legislative proposals that would fine men for aggressive catcalling or lecherous behavior toward women in public, and lengthen the statute of limitations for cases involving minors. Marl√®ne Schiappa, France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s junior minister for gender equality, said that France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parliament would also debate whether to establish a clear age below which a minor cannot consent to a sexual relationship. The decision came after French prosecutors declined to charge a 28-year-old man with rape after he had sex with an 11-year-old girl.In March, Ms. Deneuve defended Roman Polanski, the director who pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl and who was accused by two other women of forcing himself on them when they were under age. While appearing on a French television channel, Ms. Deneuve said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been dealt with, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been judged. There have been agreements between Roman Polanski and this woman.‚<U+0080>ùIn concluding the letter, the writers return to the concept of self-victimization and a call for women to accept the pitfalls that come with freedom. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Accidents that can affect a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s body do not necessarily affect her dignity and must not, as hard as they can be, necessarily make her a perpetual victim,‚<U+0080>ù they write. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Because we are not reducible to our bodies. Our inner freedom is inviolable. And this freedom that we cherish is not without risks and responsibilities.‚<U+0080>ùIf you were dream-casting the role of Golden Globes host for the season of #MeToo and #TimesUp, with black-clad attendees from TV series and films that confronted misogyny (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Handmaid‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Tale‚<U+0080>ù) and racism (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Get Out‚<U+0080>ù) and a barnburner of a speech by a black female icon, you might not have picked the straight white guy.Nor, apparently, would the straight white guy. From his opening line, Seth Meyers hung a light on the dissonance of a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s being the master of this ceremony: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.‚<U+0080>ù Hosts of future awards shows, he said, were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>watching me tonight like the first dog they shot into outer space.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers borrowed a bit from his late-night talk show, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jokes Seth Can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t Tell,‚<U+0080>ù in which Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel deliver comedy that would sound strange coming from him. Here, he set up a gag for stars including Jessica Chastain (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Golden Globes turned 75 this year ‚<U+0080>¶ ‚<U+0080>ù), who sold the punch line (‚<U+0080><U+009C> ‚<U+0080>¶ but the actress that plays its wife is still only 32‚<U+0080>ù).Irony is Mr. Meyers‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thing, and he was deftly funny pointing it out. But the fact remains that the change in the air at the Globes is a recent and hardly complete process.On the one hand, the speeches from the podium were often sharply conscious ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not just the acceptances. Natalie Portman, presenting the best director award for film, announced, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Here are the all-male nominees.‚<U+0080>ùAnd Oprah Winfrey, accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, took the audience to church with a fervent, personal speech dedicated to abused women inside and outside Hollywood. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But their time is up.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers wisecracked in his monologue about the notion that Ms. Winfrey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has played down her political ambitions before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might run for president. By the end of her speech, it sounded a tiny bit less like a joke.Still, for all the consensus from the stage, the Globes still celebrated the power players of a system in which Harvey Weinstein, whose abuses precipitated the current moment, was active just a year ago. And at the awards, by and large, the men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> half of any gender dynamic in Hollywood or elsewhere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> let their ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up‚<U+0080>ù pins do the talking.Awards celebration has mingled with dissent before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like at last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Globes, just before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. (He still took a few digs this year.)It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something else for the usually frothy Globes to be held at a moment when the industry, or at least a portion of it, is dissenting against itself.The unsteady balance was apparent from the first footsteps on the red carpet. There were fewer questions about who the stars were wearing, and more about why. (Again, the women fielded a lot more of those questions than the men.)But there was dissonance, too, in an awards-media system not usually equipped to handle matters weightier than a champagne bubble. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Let me just tell you, our coverage is woke!‚<U+0080>ù said the E! correspondent Justin Sylvester, by way of introducing the 360-degree camera at the celebrity arrival area.When woke met woke, it was sometimes a rude awakening. On the E! red-carpet special, Debra Messing called out the network for its treatment of its former news host Catt Sadler, who said she left E! because of a gender pay gap. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Messing said.For much of the night, though, it was a surprisingly ordinary Golden Globes. It wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t quite a celebration; it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely a protest. (Even the black color scheme ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a visual statement for the women, less so for the ordinarily tux-clad men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> conveyed the feeling of a half-demonstration.) The Golden Globes always pitches itself as a televised party, but what kind?Maybe, as the color scheme suggested, the awards were meant to be a wake for a system of victimization. But it will be a good number of awards cycles, after the black outfits are put away, before we know if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite dead.When the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed in 1993, Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bloody troubles did not die with him. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here,‚<U+0080>ù Maria McFarland S√°nchez-Moreno, who spent years as a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch, writes about the harrowing violence carried out by paramilitary groups that bloomed in the country in the late 1990s. She focuses on the stories of three men who have tried to help solve the problem against enormous odds: the human rights activist Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Valle, who was murdered for what he exposed; the prosecutor Iv√°n Vel√°squez; and the journalist Ricardo Calder√≥n. The book covers their dangerous efforts, the links between the paramilitaries and Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political establishment, and the influence of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and its war on drugs. Ms. McFarland, now the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, discusses below the bravery of her subjects, the inspiration she takes from photojournalists who work in conflict areas and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It started when I had finished up being a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch. I had spent six years documenting atrocities and trying to get the government to address them. But I was frustrated, because all those documents I had been producing didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really capture the reality I had gotten to know so well, the stories of these extraordinary people, who despite horrendous conditions often insisted on fighting for truth, for justice; insisted on being incredibly honest even though they could have easily gone in another direction and all the pressures were in that direction. In the United States, anyone who knew anything about Colombia knew about Pablo Escobar and the FARC, but very few people knew about the paramilitaries, and stories usually depicted the heroes as D.E.A. agents or law enforcement. They were missing this whole piece, these ordinary people who make tremendous sacrifices, take huge risks and often get killed because they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re standing on principle.I started out with the idea of just doing an article in 2012. I was very focused on the story of Iv√°n Vel√°squez, who had followed the links between congress and these paramilitary death squads. He had worked very much alone with not much support, and faced an elaborate campaign by high-level government officials and those in the intelligence service to discredit him. As I talked to him, I realized it was part of a much larger story. He was personally connected to the other two characters in the book. I started drafting a book proposal, which took four years to write. The book took two.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I knew that people were brave. But once I started asking them for their stories in details, I was surprised by just how many risks they took. And when I spoke to their family members, they received threats and had themselves been wrapped up in this and terribly impacted. Yet they had never tried to get them to stop doing their work. In fact, Mar√≠a Victoria, Iv√°n‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, kept some very serious threats made against her secret because she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want him to give up what he was doing. She knew it would break him because it was such an important part of who he was, to follow through on his commitment.With Calder√≥n, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize the sort of risks he had taken. I knew him as a journalist, and I knew he had exposed these scandals and efforts to smear Vel√°squez. I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize just how intrepid he was because he was just so humble. Years later, I found out he had actually been abducted by his sources in the intelligence service at one point. They thought he was going to betray them and they needed to know if he was being straight with them. They gave him this drug to tell the truth and he lost consciousness overnight. He just kept going with his work; met with them the next day and they apologized.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I started out with a very important story about one man who led these investigations and was attacked and then prevailed. It turned into a much richer story when I brought in these other characters and dug into the history. Once I had a broader scope and more characters, I could trace the arc of how the paramilitaries grew and what they were, and how they were able to gain so much power and influence and develop all these connections, in a way I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have been able to do if the book had been about one set of investigations.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Photojournalists, in general, who have worked in some of these conflicts. One of them is Stephen Ferry, with whom I worked very closely in Colombia. He captured the humanity and all sorts of nuances of the reality of Colombia in ways that aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t usually presented in journalism and in the policy world. Seeing someone who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to capture those deeper aspects of reality made me also want to do that.Another piece that made an impression on me while I was writing the book was Joshua Oppenheimer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Look of Silence,‚<U+0080>ù a sequel to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Act of Killing.‚<U+0080>ù He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to show what it means for people to live with a legacy of mass atrocity while the perpetrators are still in power, and in a way that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what was happening in Colombia while I was there.Persuade someone to read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here‚<U+0080>ù in 50 words or less.It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a fast-paced true story, something of a thriller. It introduces you to brutality and corruption in a country at the center of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> war on drugs. It also offers hope that brave, committed people who care about what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right can make a difference.This interview has been condensed and edited.Your book ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Doomsday Machine‚<U+0080>ù is a warning, based on your experience at the highest levels of nuclear planning at RAND in the early 1960s, that an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust killing nearly every human alive could happen much more easily than most people realize ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which is a pretty urgent message. Why did it take you nearly 60 years to write about it? It didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I submitted the first third of the book to a publisher in 1975, as soon as the war ended. Her response was we would only sell 1,400 copies of this book. So I thought, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All right, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s enough for every member of Congress and a lot of media people and academics.‚<U+0080>ù And she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No, that means we wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t publish it.‚<U+0080>ù And that was reiterated a number of times in succeeding years.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re warning people that human civilization itself is at risk, and so many people don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be concerned. Does it ever make you feel as if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re the crazy one? No, it makes me feel that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m living in a country in a very intense state of denial. I was saying to my wife the other day, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You know, if I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know any more than the public knows about the nuclear danger, I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be worried about it either.‚<U+0080>ùIf an accidental nuclear war does happen, will you have the willpower not to tell everyone ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I told you so?‚<U+0080>ù Well, how much time would I have? In San Francisco I would expect to be within the range of immediate effects.You were 30 years old when you wrote America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nuclear-war plans for the defense secretary, Robert McNamara. Is that too much responsibility for someone that young? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too much responsibility for an 86-year-old or a 70-year-old. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever had a human leader in any state that could really live up to that responsibility.How does it feel to write a plan that would kill tens of millions of people? I was in denial. I was part of a plan that should never have been made that was a crime against humanity. I once came to a disarmament press conference at the U.N., and Time had just had a picture on their cover of a terrorist, and I showed this picture from Time, and I said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I want to see a nuclear terrorist, I just have to look in the mirror.‚<U+0080>ù Now if you say, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do I feel about that?‚<U+0080>ù Well, I feel terrible.How surprised are you that there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a nuclear apocalypse yet? I am surprised. On the whole, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been incredibly lucky. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something like a miracle, but miracles, I guess, do happen. Could we survive another 70 or 100 years without nuclear winter? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unlikely, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not impossible. But no matter how small the likelihood is, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m working to try to double it.Do you think President Trump is utilizing the madman theory with North Korea, purposely making them think he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unstable, or is he just a madman? Oh, sure, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very explicit about it. He says he cannot reject first use of nuclear weapons, because you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to keep it on the table. Well, that worried people, because he looks crazy, so people thought, Gee, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not just using the theory here, he is unfortunately making a very credible threat. But since the mid-‚<U+0080><U+0099>60s the idea of initiating nuclear war by the U.S. has been nothing other than a madman theory. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been insane to think of doing that.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re most famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers, which are the subject of the movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Post.‚<U+0080>ù What do you think of how you were portrayed? Very, very well, because I was portrayed by a terrific actor who looks a lot as I did at the time, only better.The charges against you were thrown out after it was discovered that Richard Nixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>plumbers‚<U+0080>ù broke into your psychoanalyst‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office looking for dirt on you. Does it ever amaze you that after carrying out the biggest leak of government secrets in American history, you pretty much got off scot-free? It was a miracle. As I say, secular miracles do happen.ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain By Abby Norman 272 pp. Nation Books. $27.In the 1940s, in their quest to devise an objective pain scale, Cornell University researchers poked an increasingly hot metal rod into the hands of 13 women in the throes of childbirth. The volunteers were supposed to express how each level of heat compared with the others. But as labor progressed and the rod got hotter, they were in too much distress (and quite possibly distracted with other kinds of pain) to grapple with adjectives. Throbbing? Searing? A 7 on a scale of 10?And therein lies the conundrum. Few of us can express our aches and hurts accurately, particularly when we are in the thick of them.This quirky bit of medical history opens Abby Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vivid memoir, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus.‚<U+0080>ù But the focus of the book is really in the subtitle: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain.‚<U+0080>ù She builds a convincing case that women describing discomfort are more likely than men to be dismissed by physicians, but along the way tells a story that will resonate with anyone (man or woman) who has ever experienced pain.Norman suffers from endometriosis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a chronic and debilitating illness triggered by uterine-like cells growing outside of the womb. Women with the disorder have heavy, agonizing periods along with a litany of other symptoms depending on where the rogue cells lurk. If they congregate near the bladder, urinating hurts; near the sciatic nerve, pain can shoot down the legs; inside the lung (a rare event), breathing can be stifled.After one bout ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>as sudden as a thunderclap. A stabbing pain in my middle‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Norman eventually got to an emergency room, where she was handed the typical 1-10 pain scorecard. She was still aching, but not in the original horrors of it all. So she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how to assign a number to it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Bad enough that I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ignore it, which made it definitely higher than a four or five.‚<U+0080>ù She questioned whether she was a six or higher and whether the doctor would believe her anyhow.Norman repeatedly told doctors that sexual intercourse ached ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like a dull pinch, that resonated to my pelvis.‚<U+0080>ù No one paid attention until her boyfriend accompanied her and mentioned his frustration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Becoming a disappointment to a man,‚<U+0080>ù she writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>seemed to do the trick.‚<U+0080>ùNorman is a terrific storyteller with a gift for weaving memorable anecdotes, some drawn from medical history, others from recent scientific debates and most plucked from her own travails. We learn about Sigmund Freud and his views of his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hysterical‚<U+0080>ù female clients. We read about baby monkeys who grew up with emotional issues because their real cuddly moms were removed at birth and replaced with pretend wire-doll monkey-mothers. We learn of recent ideas challenging long-held notions about the origins of endometriosis. Many experts no longer believe the disease is triggered by uterine cells that escaped the womb, but rather by uterine-like cells that originated outside of it.Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life is much more than a disease. She emancipated herself from her family at the age of 16 and sought solace in books, particularly scientific literature, to understand her symptoms. Many doctors chalked up her distress to physical expressions of a psychic trauma.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus‚<U+0080>ù is an important addition to a long tradition of pain memoirs. Norman shares a particular tale of suffering but expresses a common frustration about the dearth of words to convey pain. Any schoolgirl can talk about love, Virginia Woolf famously said, but ‚<U+0080><U+009C>let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.‚<U+0080>ùJERUSALEM ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Polish and Israeli officials met on Thursday to address the diplomatic rift that erupted over a new Polish law that makes it a crime to blame Poland for the Holocaust, a measure that Israeli officials have likened to Holocaust denial.The law, adopted last month over the furious objections of Israel and scholars from around the world, makes it a crime to blame ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Polish nation‚<U+0080>ù for the Holocaust and other World War II atrocities carried out by the Nazis during their occupation from 1939 to 1945.It was the Nazis who oversaw the exterminations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by means of mass shootings, gas chambers, starvation and slave labor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that claimed the lives of some six million Jews. But the role of Polish collaborators, participants and enablers in the Nazi-run system of mechanized death remains a subject of fraught historical inquiry.Poland‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right-wing government says its goal is to defend the nation from slander, but scholars say the result is to stifle inquiry and reconciliation.Last week, a group of Poles who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II added their voices to the debate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We ask you not to rewrite history,‚<U+0080>ù the Poles ‚<U+0080><U+0094> among 6,850 Poles recognized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>righteous among the nations‚<U+0080>ù for their heroism ‚<U+0080><U+0094> wrote in an open letter to both Polish and Israeli leaders.One of those who signed the letter was Anna Stupnicka-Bando, 89, who was a teenager when she and her mother smuggled books and food into the Warsaw ghetto. It was during one of those illegal trips that they met an 11-year-old Jewish girl, Liliana Adler, whom they hid in their two-bedroom apartment at her father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s urging.Posing as Anna‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cousin, Liliana lived with the family ‚<U+0080><U+0094> under their neighbors‚<U+0080><U+0099> suspicious gazes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for four years until they were liberated by the Soviet Army in 1945.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everyone knows that there were those who were good and those who were bad,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said in a phone interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those who were saving Jews, and those who were robbing and murdering them. There were heroes just as there were thieves and killers. Just like there were in every other nation. To say different is harmful and nonsensical.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is it now with all this counting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> this checking how many of us were good and how many were bad? We are not some potatoes planted in a field that can be counted. We are people. Let it go.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Stupnicka-Bando said the new dispute was unnecessary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In recent years, we had finally managed to get some peace and quiet,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like all those conflicts and tensions were gone. How can they be back? How can one unfortunate phrase, one inaccurately written sentence destroy all of it?‚<U+0080>ùOn Thursday, Israeli and Polish diplomats met for more than three hours in what the Israeli Foreign Ministry described as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>candid and open dialogue,‚<U+0080>ù although the talks were inconclusive.The Israeli side was represented by Yuval Rotem, the ministry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director general, and included diplomats, legal experts and historians from Yad Vashem.At the start of the talks, Mr. Rotem told the Polish team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> led by the deputy foreign minister, Bartosz Cichocki ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no secret‚<U+0080>ù that the legislation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a matter of concern to Israel and to the Jewish people worldwide.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We must make sure that historical truths are preserved, that there be no restrictions on the freedom of research and speech, and that the wide threat of criminalization in this regard is addressed and resolved.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the closed-door talks, the ministry said it was especially concerned about ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the criminalization clause, which constitutes an obstacle to the study of the truth and to open historical debate.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also expressed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>concern about the public atmosphere that had recently been created in Poland and manifestations of anti-Semitism, and stressed the need for the Polish government to act with zero tolerance in the face of anti-Semitism.‚<U+0080>ùThe dispute has strained relations between Israel and Poland. At a security conference last month in Munich, Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confronted his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki.During a discussion, Ronen Bergman, a journalist who covers intelligence affairs for Yediot Ahronot and writes for The New York Times Magazine,  remarked that his parents, who were born in Poland, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lost much of their families because their Polish neighbors snitched to the Gestapo.‚<U+0080>ùHe added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After the war my mother swore she would never speak Polish for the rest of her life, not even a single word.‚<U+0080>ùIn a rambling response, Mr. Morawiecki said it would remain legal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian, not only German perpetrators.‚<U+0080>ùThe reference to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jewish perpetrators‚<U+0080>ù infuriated Israelis and others. Mr. Netanyahu called the comments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>outrageous‚<U+0080>ù and added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people.‚<U+0080>ùEven so, Mr. Netanyahu has resisted pressure from legislators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including some from within his governing coalition ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to recall Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ambassador to Poland.In an opinion article in Haaretz on Thursday, the deputy prime minister of Poland, Jaroslaw Gowin, said that Israeli-Polish cooperation had improved in recent years and urged further dialogue.How the law will be enforced remains to be seen. Historians, journalists and artists are to be exempted from prosecution under the law, and Joanna Kopcinska, a government spokeswoman, said that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>witnesses of history‚<U+0080>ù would also be exempt.The Polish government, which has also curbed judicial independence and the press, is feuding with the European Union over the state of the rule of law in Poland.On Thursday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the European Commission, the bloc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executive body, which has threatened to strip Poland of voting rights because of threats to democratic norms.The commission warned Poland this week that it had until March 20 to backtrack on its judicial changes before Brussels takes action. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The clock is ticking,‚<U+0080>ù Michael Roth, Germany‚<U+0080><U+0099>s minister for European Union affairs, told journalists.The tensions on both fronts might have given the governing Law and Justice party pause. This week, the speaker of Parliament delayed debate on a proposal to establish a day of memorial honoring Poles who saved Jews.Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said she hoped the current tensions were a result of a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misunderstanding and not ill will.‚<U+0080>ù She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We, the righteous ones, are optimists.‚<U+0080>ùEwa Junczyk-Ziomecka, the president of the Jan Karski Educational Foundation, which organized the open letter, noted that many of the letter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s signers were in their 90s, and she worried that memories of righteous acts were fading.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried that their legacy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the mutual understanding between Poles and Jews they achieved ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might now be lost,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said.She added that it would be important to study the experiences of both groups ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Jews inside the ghetto walls, non-Jewish Poles in their occupied country.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jews and Poles spent years learning about what is a source of pain for the Jews, and what it is in the Polish soul that hurts,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Their memories complete each other. They can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t imagine that someone might break them apart.‚<U+0080>ùA level-headed documentary lies behind the hot-blooded title of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy: Death, Denial & Depiction.‚<U+0080>ù While there may be no completely dispassionate way to discuss its topic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Armenian genocide ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s balance of emotion and composure helps make its stories even stronger.Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in the early part of the 20th century. What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.Joe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Promise,‚<U+0080>ù a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plan is smart as well as symbolic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.At its core, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy‚<U+0080>ù is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,‚<U+0080>ù one scholar says near the end of the documentary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>History is not in the past.‚<U+0080>ùOn most days, Facebook doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much in common with President Trump. But at the moment, both are in the damage-control business, as they try to get out from under the cloud of suspicion related to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meddling in the 2016 election.Their goals collided in awkward fashion over the weekend when Rob Goldman, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of advertising, posted a series of messages on Twitter that were meant to clear up misconceptions about Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s role in the election. Instead, he plunged the company deeper into controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Goldman tweeted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman was tweeting only for himself, but his comments, which drew praise from other Facebook executives on Twitter, were an unusually candid statement that flouted Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s well-sculpted messaging strategy, which has generally been to stay as far away from partisan debates as possible. The tweets arrived soon after the blockbuster indictment of Russian nationals by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and they were noticed by right-wing partisans, who saw them as supporting evidence for Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no collusion‚<U+0080>ù claims. Soon, Mr. Trump himself had retweeted them approvingly.Mr. Goldman eventually walked back some of his statements, but it was too late. Mr. Goldman had just given Mr. Trump something that looked like a Facebook-stamped exoneration.Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t mean to bolster the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s position.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,‚<U+0080>ù Joel Kaplan, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.It is Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.But Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mistakes have been. (Last year, in a tweet that fewer people saw, Andrew Bosworth, another Facebook vice president, claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marginal, even in a close election.‚<U+0080>ù)In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.Even before Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation had found. He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s favor was not a primary goal of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interference from outside researchers.Some of Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far ‚<U+0080><U+0094> such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would be just as effective today.In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve tried.) But it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform‚<U+0080><U+0099>s problems and protecting our democracy.Once you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve read an excellent book about climate change, which Jeff Goodell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù most certainly is, you can never unremember the facts. Elected officials may be busy arguing about whether global warming is real. But most scientists are having other arguments entirely ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about whether danger is imminent or a few decades off; about whether our prospects are dire or merely grim.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has little trouble imagining it. He opens ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù with a fictional hurricane whipping through Miami in 2037. It sweeps the Art Deco buildings of South Beach off their foundations, disgorges millions of gallons of raw sewage into Biscayne Bay and eats the last of the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s beaches. Thousands scramble for bottled water dropped by the National Guard. Zika and dengue fever start to bloom (so much moisture, so many mosquitoes). Out rush the retirees and glamour pusses; in rush the lawyers and slumlords. Within decades, the place is swallowed whole by the ocean. What was once a vibrant city is now a scuba-diving destination for intrepid historians and disaster tourists.The whole scenario seems indecently feasible by the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end.After this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù is depressingly well-timed, though I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on. Political time now lags behind geological time: If we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take dramatic steps to prepare for the rising seas, hundreds of millions could be displaced from their homes by the end of the century, and the infrastructure fringing the coast, valued in the trillions of dollars, could be lost.Unfortunately, human beings are uniquely ill-suited to prepare for disasters they cannot sense or see. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have evolved to defend ourselves from a guy with a knife or an animal with big teeth,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but we are not wired to make decisions about barely perceptible threats that gradually accelerate over time.‚<U+0080>ùSo we stick our heads in the sand. Until the sand disappears, anyway.To give you an idea of why many climate scientists are so nervous: Over the course of the earth‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history, seas have risen drastically whenever ice sheets suddenly collapsed. And that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s precisely what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening now. Greenland is melting at a furious rate ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by 2040, Goodell writes, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to windsurf at the North Pole ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and so are the ice shelves of Antarctica.Many of our climate reports, including the one that formed the basis of the 2015 Paris Agreement, hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t predicted this. Their authors assumed that the most the sea could rise by 2100 was three feet, two inches. Now many scientists believe that estimate is too low. Some say the sea could rise as much as six feet; others say even more than that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For anyone living in Miami Beach or South Brooklyn or Boston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Back Bay or any other low-lying coastal neighborhood,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the difference between three feet of sea level rise by 2100 and six feet is the difference between a wet but livable city and a submerged city.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has been writing about climate change for many years. (His previous books include ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Big Coal‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How to Cool the Planet.‚<U+0080>ù) He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the real deal, committed and making house calls. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come,‚<U+0080>ù partly built on stories he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s written for Rolling Stone, he visits cities in peril around the globe: New York; Lagos, Nigeria; Norfolk, Va.; Miami; Venice; Rotterdam. He speaks to a great many politicians, including Barack Obama, eventually asking some version of, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given what you know, aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t you scared out of your wits?‚<U+0080>ù (Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s response: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yeah.‚<U+0080>ù) At an art event, Goodell buttonholes an influential developer in Miami, Jorge P√©rez, and asks several variations of the same question. P√©rez insists he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unworried. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Besides,‚<U+0080>ù he adds, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>by that time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be dead, so what does it matter?‚<U+0080>ùThe full exchange is worth reading. It plays out like something from a Carl Hiaasen novel. All that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s missing are the twin blondes in the hot tub.Of all the American cities in this book, Miami seems least equipped to handle a rise in sea level, founded as it is on pleasure, real estate and the inalienable right to not pay state income taxes. (When a local geologist undertook a larger project to show just how much fecal matter was in Biscayne Bay, the mayor of Miami Beach went ballistic.) But every coastal city faces its own obstacles to adaptation, and the problems each one faces are different.Naval Station Norfolk, the largest navy base in the world, may have as few as 20 good years left. Yet it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s located in a climate-denial hot spot in Virginia, and it depends on more than a few climate-deniers in Congress for funding. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Many people in the military end up talking about climate in much the way eighth graders talk about sex ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with code words,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes.New York City may have more climate-change realists doing its bidding and spending its dollars. But the barrier the city plans to build to protect Wall Street ‚<U+0080><U+0094> you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to protect Wall Street, right? ‚<U+0080><U+0094> could deflect water into poorer neighborhoods. (And let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not even discuss the fate of the subways.)It is, perhaps, the world‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor who will suffer most. Goodell devotes a good deal of this book to contemplating their fate. Salty soil has already destroyed the rice crops of the Mekong Delta and Bangladesh. If the sea rises high enough, whole island nations could be washed away. The slum-dwellers of Lagos, Jakarta and other coastal cities in the developing world could be chased from their homes, many of which are already on stilts. The International Organization for Migration estimates there will be 200 million climate refugees by 2050.Yet even countries with means can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get their citizens to focus on this problem. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The average American right now,‚<U+0080>ù Obama tells Goodell, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even if they‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing.‚<U+0080>ùWater simply isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t on their minds. They‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got more pressing concerns to keep at bay.Looking for love or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>casual encounter‚<U+0080>ù? You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have to find it someplace other than Craigslist.The venerable online classifieds site removed its ‚<U+0080><U+009C>personals‚<U+0080>ù section this week, after Congress sent a bill to President Trump aimed at curtailing sex trafficking.Craigslist, little changed since it unveiled its spare text design in 1995 and began to crush the paid print classifieds business, will no longer offer a way for anonymous people to connect for romance or sex.While many people used the site to find relationships ‚<U+0080><U+0094> one of the discontinued categories is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strictly platonic‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it was no secret that some postings were thinly veiled solicitations for prostitution, despite the site‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to fight overt solicitations for money.Visitors to the personals section of Craigslist are now redirected to a short statement about the bill, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which gives law enforcement officials greater authority to go after websites used for sex trafficking, while removing protections from legal liability for hosting such content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any tool or service can be misused,‚<U+0080>ù Craigslist said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking Craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through Craigslist, we wish you every happiness!‚<U+0080>ùThe website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personals section has attracted listings of all kinds, reflecting a range of interests, sexual orientations and combinations of partners. Some users have found lasting relationships and marriage.On Friday, inventive users were already turning to other parts of Craigslist, like the famous ‚<U+0080><U+009C>missed connections‚<U+0080>ù section, to post their personals instead.Craigslist has faced criticism over its role in facilitating prostitution and trafficking before. About a decade ago, after reaching an agreement with 40 state attorneys general, it undertook a series of changes in order to curb the practices.The online forums site Reddit also removed a handful of escort-related communities in recent days, though the ban was part of a broader crackdown on the exchange of weapons, drugs, sexual services, stolen goods and falsified documents.Many survivors of sex trafficking and the illegal prostitution trade have praised the legislation as a significant advance in their fight against the practice.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It really provides both survivors and folks in law enforcement with the tools to hold websites that are knowingly facilitating trafficking accountable,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a coalition of groups that worked with the legislators who sponsored the bill.Ms. Hersh said that some websites known to have been used for trafficking have already disappeared.Some tech companies, civil liberties groups and organizations of voluntary sex workers have argued that the bill overreaches.Though its goal is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>worthy,‚<U+0080>ù the bill may have unintended consequences, Ian Thompson, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a post this month.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The bill is worded so broadly that it could even be used against platform owners that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know that their sites are being used for trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a statement after the Senate passed the bill.Even anti-trafficking organizations are not united in their support. Freedom Network USA, a coalition of groups, said in a statement that the bill would only drive voluntary sex workers further underground.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Consensual commercial sex workers use harm reduction tools such as online forums to screen clients, avoid high risk activities, share resources, and protect each other,‚<U+0080>ù it said.While Ms. Hersh acknowledged that there may be some in the sex trade who use the websites willingly, the bill, she said, will save many others from exploitation.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We work with survivors, many of whom have been exploited on these websites, and so we are seeing firsthand the extraordinary harm that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening to many women and children,‚<U+0080>ù she said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.With passage of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to stay out of the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,‚<U+0080>ù the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a wake-up call,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.‚<U+0080>ùPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And down the road, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s content from foreign governments.‚<U+0080>ùInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s required,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.‚<U+0080>ùWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law ‚<U+0080><U+009C>would almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,‚<U+0080>ù said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re opening the courthouse doors,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>acknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> trafficking‚<U+0080>ù but were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>powerless to act,‚<U+0080>ù Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The big guys can take care of themselves.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.‚<U+0080>ùNEW YORK ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The leader of a secretive group in upstate New York turned female followers into brainwashed ""slaves"" who were branded with his initials and coerced into having sex, authorities alleged on Monday in a criminal complaint charging him with sex-trafficking.Keith Raniere, co-founder of the group called Nxivm, was arrested in Mexico and returned to Texas Monday, authorities said. He was to appear in court on Tuesday in Fort Worth on the charges filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.According to the complaint, Raniere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known within the group as ""Vanguard"" ‚<U+0080><U+0094> oversaw a barbaric system in which women were told the best way to advance was to become a ""slave"" overseen by ""masters."" They also were expected to have sex with him and do menial chores for masters, and to keep the arrangement a secret or be publicly humiliated, the complaint says.The name of Raniere's attorney wasn't immediately available on Monday. In a letter attributed to Raniere previously posted on a website related to Nxivm, he denied the practices were sanctioned by the self-described self-help group.""These allegations are most disturbing to me as non-violence is one of my most important values,"" the letter said.The complaint said that many victims participated in videotaped ceremonies where they were branded in their pelvic area with a symbol featuring Raniere's initials.""During the branding ceremonies, slaves were required to be fully naked, and the master would order one slave to film while the other held down the slave being branded,"" the complaint says.Investigators said Raniere preferred exceptionally thin women, so ""slaves"" had to stick to very low-calorie diets and document every food they ate. As punishment for not following orders, women were forced to attend classes where they were ""forced to wear fake cow udders over their breasts while people called them derogatory names,"" or threatened with being put in cages, court papers say.Raniere left the United States late last year after The New York Times reported the stories of some women who defected from their secret sorority and the government began interviewing potential witnesses. He sought to cover this trail by using encrypted email and ditching his phone, court papers say.He was ultimately found staying with several women in a luxury gated community in Puerta Vallarta where villas can run $10,000 a week to rent, investigators say. After authorities took him into custody on a U.S. warrant, investigators said the women got into a high-speed car chase.The website related to the group describes Raniere as a ""scientist, mathematician, philosopher, entrepreneur, educator, inventor and author"" who has ""devoted his life to studying the human psychodynamic and developing new tools for human empowerment, expression and ethics.""Nxivm's Mexican affiliate is headed by Emiliano Salinas, a son of that country's former president. Several women who belong to the group in Mexico have traveled to Albany, where they were branded, two former Nxivm members told the Times.Salinas has also denied that the sorority is affiliated with Nxivm.Raniere and Nxivm have been the subject of criticism for years, dating back to at least 2012 when the Times Union of Albany published a series of articles examining the organization and allegations that it was like a cult.Over the years, Nxivm has attracted a following that includes Emmy Award-winning actress Allison Mack. Authorities also say Raniere has been bankrolled by Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune.Bronfman gave millions of dollars covering expenses like private air travel costing $65,000 flight, court papers say.The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies.Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive.But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Congress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t able to commit offline.‚<U+0080>ùA similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon.The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield.The bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms.Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Clearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,‚<U+0080>ù said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.‚<U+0080>ùFacebook began to change its position on the bill last fall, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,‚<U+0080>ù Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.‚<U+0080>ùSome large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills.Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.Three pastors accused of exploiting and abusing teenage girls were indicted this week on federal child sex trafficking charges in Toledo, Ohio.The men, Kenneth Butler, 37; Anthony J. Haynes, 38; and Cordell Jenkins, 47, were charged with conspiracy for child sex trafficking as part of an 11-count indictment handed down on Tuesday, the United States Attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office for the Northern District of Ohio said. The three men pleaded not guilty.They are accused of sexually assaulting a girl beginning in 2014, when she was 14, through 2017. Some of the abuse is thought to have taken place at hotels and at Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, where Mr. Haynes was a pastor and used his telephone to record the sexual assaults, prosecutors said.Mr. Haynes gave the girl money and told her not to tell anyone, saying it would ruin his family and his church, according to court documents. He ‚<U+0080><U+009C>facilitated‚<U+0080>ù the victim being abused by several other men, including Mr. Jenkins, who repeatedly sexually exploited the girl at his home, in his office at Abundant Life Ministries, and at a motel in Toledo, prosecutors said.Mr. Jenkins recorded the abuse with his cellphone and paid the girl with what he called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hush money,‚<U+0080>ù court documents said. He also allegedly abused a second girl in March of this year.Mr. Butler, who was a pastor at Kingdom Encounter Family Worship Center in Detroit, about an hour from Toledo, was also indicted on sex trafficking charges involving a third girl who was abused between 2015 and March 2017, the court documents said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three have religious affiliations and knew each other in that capacity,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Tobin, a spokesman for the United States attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three claim to be ministers in one form or another.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges are part of a superseding indictment that expands sex trafficking charges originally handed down in April against Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Haynes, and adds Mr. Butler as a defendant in the case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It takes the three of them and loops them all into one big conspiracy with three victims,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Tobin.The three men will remain in custody until their next hearing, scheduled for January.Allison Folmar, a lawyer for Mr. Jenkins, said on Thursday that he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>done a lot of good‚<U+0080>ù in his community, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but all of that is clearly overshadowed with what he is facing right now.‚<U+0080>ùA lawyer for Mr. Butler, Adam S. Nightingale, confirmed on Thursday that his client had pleaded not guilty, but did not comment further. Mr. Haynes‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer could not be reached for comment.Just before he was arrested in October, Mr. Butler posted a video on the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook page introducing himself as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pastor B,‚<U+0080>ù and saying he wanted to make a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>public apology.‚<U+0080>ù In the video, which has since been removed, he said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is never my intention to hurt or displease God. Let alone you, the people.‚<U+0080>ùMOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Nearly every day, a teenager is missing from Hawthorne Cedar Knolls, a rehabilitation center for emotionally troubled children that sits on a sprawling campus in this Westchester County town.Home to many young people who have been trafficked for sex, Hawthorne is supposed to help heal them and head off their return to prostitution and exploitation. But the center, run by a nonprofit group and intended to be a relatively open facility, has seen girl after girl, most of them from New York City, go missing.People who have worked in child welfare in and around New York City say there is a pipeline from centers like the ones here back to the streets, where children fall prey to the abuse that they were supposed to escape. Over the last 18 months, the state, which oversees residential treatment centers like Hawthorne, stopped sending children to Hawthorne and to the nearby Pleasantville Cottage School. Among the 51 centers statewide, Hawthorne and Pleasantville are the only ones to have faced such severe sanctions over missing children in recent years.By design and by law, conditions at residential treatment centers are less restrictive than those at many of the other programs for children with severe mental health problems. Residential treatment centers are not juvenile detention centers, and they are supposed to provide a homelike experience. Children cannot be locked down, and older children are encouraged to attend programs outside the campus and hold part-time jobs as part of their rehabilitation. But people who work with the residents said that a lack of rigorous, engaging programs, especially for victims of sex trafficking, had made their open atmosphere a liability.Hawthorne was recently drawn into a trafficking investigation after a teenage girl who went missing from Hawthorne ended up in the Bronx with a 25-year-old man.The man has been charged with sex trafficking, rape, prostitution and other crimes in a state case involving the girl, and he has been charged as a conspirator in a federal investigation of a Bronx drug-trafficking ring.Prosecutors have not accused Hawthorne or its staff of any wrongdoing in connection with sex trafficking. But the involvement of a runaway from Hawthorne in the Bronx case underscored the challenges confronting such programs and the risks faced by some of the girls who are in them.The investigation offers a glimpse into an underworld in which exploitation is hard to document and prosecute. Victims often fear retribution or are wary of law enforcement and refuse to cooperate with investigations, according to lawyers and social workers. But the exploitation is real, said Paul Oliva, the police chief in Mount Pleasant. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We had these girls leaving campus, hooking up with their pimps,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Instead of escaping sexual exploitation, some teenagers are recruited by their peers inside centers and group homes, said Ed Gavin, a former acting chief of staff at the Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services in New York City. A piece of the pipeline in the region flows north to south, from the leafy, idyllic surroundings here to gritty ‚<U+0080><U+009C>trap houses‚<U+0080>ù run by twentysomething drug dealers, Mr. Gavin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People think of human trafficking as foreign. Human trafficking goes on right in the neighborhood. It goes on in the Bronx,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Gavin, who now works as a private investigator and specializes in finding missing children.The girls at Hawthorne, who range in age from 12 to 21, have been sent there through the recommendations of child welfare agencies, Family Court judges and a special education panel.The majority of the children return to their homes or are sent to a foster home or other setting closer to their families in less than a year, said David Rivel, the chief executive of the Jewish Board of Family and Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, which operates Hawthorne.Many children continue to run until they feel safe at the center, he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kids are not running away from the campus, they are running away from the trauma and abuse they have experienced, which we are encouraging them to face,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rivel said.To prevent children from regressing, there must be a balance between tough love and tolerance of behavioral problems that stem from deep-seated pain, said Jonathan McLean, the director of Hawthorne.The town of Mount Pleasant has long been home to Hawthorne and Pleasantville, which is run by the J.C.C.A., formerly known as the Jewish Child Care Association.About two miles apart, the campuses opened more than a century ago to take in the orphaned children of Jewish immigrants.About 80 young people children live at Pleasantville, while about 50 live at Hawthorne. The overwhelming majority of the residents there are black and Hispanic children from New York City.In an interview, an 18-year-old at Gateways, a program on Pleasantville‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campus for trafficked children, said she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sold her body for money,‚<U+0080>ù new clothes, trips to the nail salon and food.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I always have this thing where I bounce my way into stuff and bounce my way into this,‚<U+0080>ù the teenager said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to explain why people do it or why you do it.‚<U+0080>ùThe teenager said she had enjoyed a visit by local volunteers who brought Jamaican food, cupcakes and pumpkins, but she said she wished some of the staff members were more empathetic. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Be more open and understanding of behaviors. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t shut us out,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Making children feel wanted is key to preventing them from going missing, said Jim Purcell, the chief executive of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, an advocacy group. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For some of these kids, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s showing that someone cares,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Some of these kids AWOL to see if somebody is going to stop them.‚<U+0080>ùChief Oliva said his department, which has 45 officers, was stretched thin by helping to investigate sex trafficking cases involving missing girls, and by responding to calls from the centers and complaints from residents.To push the nonprofits to improve security, the town began charging them a fine of $250 last year for calls about missing children, he said. (As of October, the town had issued the fine 15 times.) The fines were instituted in part because residents had complained about crimes committed by children from the centers, but Mr. Oliva said it was important to remember that the children were being hurt or put in harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.From July 2016 though June, about 73 percent of the 188 New York City children at Hawthorne were reported missing, a rate that was significantly higher than those for similar programs.Mr. Rivel said the numbers at Hawthorne had been skewed by the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>overreporting‚<U+0080>ù of cases in which children had gone missing for just a few hours, but he did not dispute that the numbers reflected a crisis and that elected officials needed to help. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have a real problem here, a real challenge here,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Last year, the Jewish Board and J.C.C.A. hired directors of security, new positions for both nonprofits.At Pleasantville, the J.C.C.A. added more cameras, new lighting and new two-way radios. At Hawthorne, the Jewish Board began following children in a van on the 20-minute walk from the campus to the nearby Metro-North Railroad station. The board also installed a six-foot-high fence that stretches 200 feet through trees and brush.The tactics have reduced the number of children who go missing, though the figure remains strikingly high at Hawthorne. Since the state allowed Hawthorne to begin accepting new residents in August, about 54 percent of the 79 New York City children living there have been absent at some point, according to city data.But the idea of using highly restrictive security measures is at odds with a strong belief by many experts that emotionally damaged children should not be criminalized.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honestly, their goal is to protect these kids,‚<U+0080>ù said Staca Shehan, the executive director of the case analysis division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But at the end of the day, there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a way to force services upon them,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The field as a whole really doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have a consensus because running away from services is so prevalent.‚<U+0080>ùAdvocates said there was a need for more state funding for programs that engage children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those are the things that get lost in the shuffle when there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no money,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Purcell said.Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, a Queens Democrat who is the chairman of the social services committee, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has cut the operating budgets of the agencies that oversee troubled children by nearly 17 percent since fiscal 2012 to keep a vow to curb state spending.The state described the cuts as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cost savings‚<U+0080>ù unrelated to the direct funding of treatment centers.The state provides money to local districts that negotiate annual rates with the nonprofit organizations that run the centers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Jewish Board receives $419.78 per day for each child, and the J.C.C.A. receives $431.36. The state could set higher rates for the next fiscal year because of the cost of the new security measures at Hawthorne and Pleasantville, state officials said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After a bruising week before lawmakers, big internet companies including Facebook and Google relented to pressure in Washington on Friday and agreed to support a sex trafficking bill they had vehemently opposed for months.The bill would allow victims to sue websites that knowingly support and assist sex trafficking on their site. State attorneys general would also be able to go after the websites that support sex trafficking content.The companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.Under those conditions, the bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act, became an unpopular lobbying battle for the tech companies. Rivals such as the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Oracle and HP joined civil rights groups like National Urban League in support of the Senate bill.After weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill ‚<U+0080><U+009C>will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The bill amends Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, established in 1996, that protects online companies from liability over content they hosted on their sites. Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Removing the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shield of immunity,‚<U+0080>ù said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate‚<U+0080><U+0099>s latest effort to crack down on online sex trafficking is designed for success. Proposed legislation has an unassailable title, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017, and bipartisan support. And it targets websites that knowingly facilitate the work of sexual predators online.But the bill is running into vigorous opposition from technology companies and digital rights groups alarmed at the potential infringement of online speech.So far, the bill, which would amend the Communications Decency Act, is sponsored by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and a group of 26 other senators, including eight Democrats.It follows the culmination of a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website notorious for prostitution and trafficking ads.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Finally, victims of human trafficking are going to see justice when we get this passed, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really important to many of us who have been following this,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. This summer, the committee recommended that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s connection to online sex trafficking, citing evidence that Backpage employees were instructed to delete flagged words indicative of trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lolita,‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>rape,‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>teenage‚<U+0080>ù among them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before publishing the advertisements online.In federal and state investigations, Backpage has successfully cited as a defense Section 230 of the decency act, which says that websites cannot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.‚<U+0080>ùIf passed, the Portman bill would clarify that Section 230 cannot shield a website from federal trafficking laws. It would also impose liability for knowingly assisting and facilitating online sex trafficking, and allow civil suits related to sex trafficking.Backpage.com officials did not respond to requests for comment. The website announced in January that it had formally closed its adult section after the Senate investigation found that employers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>knowingly facilitated the criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls,‚<U+0080>ù but trafficking advertisements have been reported in the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dating section.The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which praised the bill in a letter to senators this week, reported that 73 percent of reported sex trafficking was traced through advertisements on websites like Backpage.However, some lawyers and members of the technology community say that while they support the policing of websites that knowingly encourage sex trafficking, the broad language of the bill opens other online entities to new legal challenges. With the potential for lawsuits, there is concern that websites would begin to actively and pre-emptively delete and police users‚<U+0080><U+0099> posts and videos.A similar bill introduced in the House in April, which would not only modify the decency act but create harsher penalties for providers found to have had knowledge of sex trafficking, has been criticized for being even broader than the Senate bill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It would be good for the drafters of the bill to engage seriously with the nontrivial objections that are meant to support freedom of expression online, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not freedom of expression to sex traffic,‚<U+0080>ù said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor of internet law at Harvard, emphasizing that critics were not arguing against prosecuting websites like Backpage.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried about sites that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t resemble Backpage at all running into trouble if the immunity is lifted,‚<U+0080>ù he said. Like many other critics of the bill, Mr. Zittrain said he would prefer narrower language or the chance to prosecute websites under current legislation, including the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015.And despite the strong bipartisan support in Congress, the bill will have to overcome dissent from other lawmakers and Silicon Valley executives concerned about freedom of speech on the internet.But Senate staff members involved in the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development said that they had made an effort to work with tech companies concerned about modifying the decency act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We did our due diligence, met these folks on a bipartisan basis for months, and yet they offered no constructive feedback,‚<U+0080>ù said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sad that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d oppose a narrowly crafted, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who was partially responsible for the inclusion of Section 230 in the decency act while serving in the House, said the bill was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another example of the technical ignorance of Congress threatening the jobs, lives and economic opportunities of millions of Americans.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This bill will make it less likely that tech companies help the victims this bill is meant to protect,‚<U+0080>ù he said Tuesday in a statement.Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents major online companies, said in a statement that the bill would create ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a new wave of frivolous and unpredictable actions against legitimate companies rather than addressing underlying criminal behavior.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Portman said such criticism of the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language was unfounded. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seems like a stretch to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that he felt the bill clearly targeted companies complicit in trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The alternative is not to do nothing and allow these girls and women to continue to get thwarted in every effort they make to seek justice,‚<U+0080>ù he said.In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday night, Mr. Portman argued that the bill preserved the decency act‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good Samaritan‚<U+0080>ù provision, which protects websites that regulate their content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This provision simply protects good actors who proactively block or screen for offensive material and thus shields them from any frivolous lawsuits,‚<U+0080>ù he said.For Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in particular phrases like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>assist, support or facilitate sex trafficking‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>conduct violates federal criminal law‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are too vague in defining what constitutes facilitation and violation. While she supports modest change to the statute, she said she would rather see the courts re-evaluate their interpretation of the law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s specific language.Critics also say the bill opens up websites to potential prosecution by states, a change that could force sites to make costly modifications to meet state laws or expose them to expensive litigation if a law is changed or accidentally ignored, said Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties online.It is a cost that tech giants like Google, YouTube and Twitter can handle, but that would likely stifle the development of new and smaller websites.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I worry about the next Google, the next Twitter, the next emerging platform that we would grow to love,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. McSherry said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never exist because that platform, that business would never get off the ground.‚<U+0080>ùCHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The young women, many of them from poor families in Thailand, were promised trips to the United States. They would also receive visas. Life in cities like Chicago would be rosy, they were told, and they would be able to help support their families back home.But the promises, the federal authorities say, came with an enormous toll: The women were required to work as prostitutes in cities all over this country until they could pay off exorbitant ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bondage debts,‚<U+0080>ù set as high as $60,000, to the very people who had promised them better lives.Law enforcement authorities on Thursday announced federal sex-trafficking conspiracy charges against 21 people, part of what they described as one of the most elaborate and extensive sex-trafficking operations they had seen. The operation had gone on for at least eight years, netted tens of millions of dollars, and involved hundreds of women who were shuttled among American cities, sometimes every few weeks, the officials said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The women did not have freedom of movement and, until they paid off their bondage debts, were modern-day sex slaves,‚<U+0080>ù an indictment unsealed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Minnesota said, laying out criminal counts against a long list of defendants, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. Gregory Brooker, the acting United States attorney in Minnesota, described the ring as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a multimillion-dollar, modern-day organized crime operation.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the eight-count indictment, the operation was intricate for its organization. Among those indicted were the people owed the bondage debts of the women brought from Bangkok. Others who were indicted served as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>house bosses‚<U+0080>ù in cities like Austin, Tex.; Chicago; Dallas; and Los Angeles, where they used apartments, hotels, houses and massage parlors for prostitution. Still others served as money launderers, putting cash returns into bank accounts, and facilitators, who took care of details like flying the women from city to city.While still in Thailand, the women were usually told that they would work as prostitutes, the indictment said, but the terms of the deals shifted substantially once they arrived in the United States. Threats were made. Bondage debts suddenly skyrocketed. Some women were even told to have plastic surgery to make them more ‚<U+0080><U+009C>appealing‚<U+0080>ù to customers, then ordered to reimburse the cost of surgery as part of their ever-growing debt.The authorities said the women were kept isolated and were not allowed to leave the prostitution houses without being accompanied by one of the ring organizers. The hours of prostitution often ran all day, every day.Officials said some of the women are now being helped by agencies to find housing and other assistance. But their immigration status in this country is uncertain; many were brought here with visas obtained using false information, the authorities said, including fictitious occupations and phony backgrounds. One of the main reasons women had accepted such deals in the first place, the officials said, was the promise of a legitimate visa.By Thursday, 20 of the 21 accused ‚<U+0080><U+0094> all of whom were described as organizers of the operation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had been arrested in various cities. More than a dozen others were arrested in connection with the ring last fall, officials said. In making the latest arrests in places like Chicago, Houston and San Diego, the authorities said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, along with cellphones, weapons and condoms. Lawyers for those arrested could not immediately be reached. Ten of the accused are Thai nationals; the rest are American citizens, the authorities said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Is this going to stop sex trafficking from going on? No,‚<U+0080>ù said Thomas J. Dart, the sheriff of Cook County, Ill., whose agency took part in the sprawling investigation. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no na√Øvet√© here. The notion that we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to eradicate this sort of thing is never going to happen until our society decides it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong.‚<U+0080>ùKat Sullivan was on a plane to Orlando, Fla., in February when she watched ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚<U+0080>ù for the first time, a movie about a woman who puts pressure on the local police to find her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s killer by renting out a series of giant advertising signs.That, Ms. Sullivan thought, was a good idea.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m getting a goddamn billboard,‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That woman totally epitomizes the feeling of just having to do something.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said that she was sexually abused and then raped by a former teacher when she was a student at the Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., in the 1990s. A report commissioned by Emma Willard concluded that a teacher there named Scott Sargent had been fired for sexually abusing a student but was still given letters of recommendations to teach elsewhere; Ms. Sullivan was that student.Because the abuse took place 20 years ago, the statute of limitations has long since run out, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So, using money from a settlement she received from the school, she bought a month‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth of ad space on three digital billboards, each about 50 feet wide, to call attention to the case.One billboard is in Albany, not far from Emma Willard. Another is on I-95 in Fairfield, Conn., near a school where Mr. Sargent later taught. The third is alongside I-90 in Springfield, Mass., near the town where Mr. Sargent lives today.Three images will rotate through each billboard. One points people to Ms. Sullivan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, and says, across a picture of a man with a question mark over his chest, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the truth will be revealed.‚<U+0080>ù Another is a picture of Ms. Sullivan and says: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My rapist is protected by New York state law. I am not. Neither are you. Neither are your children.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said the original design included Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and face, but that the company that owns the billboards would not allow her to use them, for fear of getting sued. Two billboard companies said they would not work with her at all.The three billboards will be up for 28 days, Ms. Sullivan said, which will cost her $14,000. (She spent about another $2,000 on the website.) Once the billboards come down, Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and photograph will appear on her website.Mr. Sargent did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement, Emma Willard said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We commend and support the survivors of sexual abuse who are committed to affecting change on this important issue.‚<U+0080>ùThe third graphic that will rotate through the billboards says ‚<U+0080><U+009C>NY Pass The Child Victims Act,‚<U+0080>ù a piece of proposed legislation in Albany that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges and allow them to sue until age 50. It would also create a one-year ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lookback‚<U+0080>ù window, during which cases from any time could proceed in court. Today, the statutes of limitations in New York that govern the sexual abuse of children are among the most restrictive in the country. Most adult survivors had until they were 23 years old, at the latest, to bring a case.Activist groups have been pushing the Child Victims Act in Albany for more than 10 years, and have made an especially aggressive effort this year, targeting specific state senators. Ms. Sullivan moved to New York City last month from her home in Florida to help lobby for the measure.Supporters are trying to make the act part of the state budget, which is due April 1 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a tactic that would give Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who supports the bill, more leverage to negotiate with legislators. The Child Victims Act has support from the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, but there is resistance to it in the Republican-controlled State Senate, which has blocked the bill for years. John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader, did not respond to questions about the legislation.A central sticking point is the lookback window. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said on Tuesday that any legislation that included it should be rejected and called the window ‚<U+0080><U+009C>toxic‚<U+0080>ù for the Catholic Church. Representatives of the church have said it supports changing the statute of limitations, but fears a flurry of lawsuits and the financial hit a lookback window might deliver.But proponents of the legislation have said that hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t happened in states that have enacted similar legislation, and they call the window crucial. In addition to providing victims their day in court, they said the window serves a public-safety function by flushing out suspected abusers who are still in the community.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The lookback window will help identify abusers, many of whom still have contact with kids,‚<U+0080>ù said State Senator Brad Hoylman, Democrat of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill in the Senate. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>New York has among the worst laws in the country on child sexual abuse. We are an outlier, so this fix is a long time coming.‚<U+0080>ùThe billboards strategy was used by activists in London pushing for arrests in the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people last year, who last month deployed three roving billboards to ask why there had been no arrests in the tragedy.Ms. Sullivan said she was motivated by the frustration that Mr. Sargent has faced no major consequences.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is free to teach, free to coach, free to be elected onto boards,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are no blemishes on his record.‚<U+0080>ùEAST LANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The investigation began with the goal of uncovering how Michigan State University officials had failed to prevent Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar from assaulting hundreds of young women over decades. But the inquiry took a stunning turn on Tuesday when a university dean was accused not just of facilitating Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, but of committing sexual misconduct himself.Dr. William D. Strampel, who worked as Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss at the College of Osteopathic Medicine, was accused by investigators of grabbing the buttocks of two female medical students. He suggested that one young woman leave school and become a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>centerfold model,‚<U+0080>ù investigators said. And he stored nude ‚<U+0080><U+009C>selfies,‚<U+0080>ù apparently of Michigan State students, on his work computer, court documents say, along with a video of Dr. Nassar performing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treatment‚<U+0080>ù on a young patient.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As dean of the college, Strampel used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition and sexually assault female students,‚<U+0080>ù a detective from Michigan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statewide police agency wrote in an affidavit.The arrest of Dr. Strampel, who is 70 and was for 15 years the highest-ranking official at the osteopathic college, compounded the crisis facing Michigan State. It has seen its reputation devastated in recent months as scores of women recounted abuse by Dr. Nassar, a longtime university sports doctor. Women have described a corrupt culture at the university that diminished or ignored the complaints some of them made about Dr. Nassar as far back as the late 1990s. Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, Lou Anna K. Simon, left under pressure in January and trustees have faced calls to resign, even as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigation into the university was expected to continue and additional charges were possible.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another blow to the university,‚<U+0080>ù Tom Leonard, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, said of the charges against Dr. Strampel. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an absolute disgrace.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Strampel ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who stepped down in December from his job as dean, where he made more than $383,000 annually, according to MLive, a local news outlet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was charged with misconduct of a public official, a felony, and three misdemeanors, including fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of willful neglect of duty. Dr. Strampel was jailed on Monday, and appeared in court via video on Tuesday afternoon wearing a gray sweatshirt, his hands cuffed in front of him. A personal recognizance bond was set at $25,000, and Dr. Strampel was ordered not to contact current or former students, and not to leave the state.John Dakmak, a lawyer for Dr. Strampel, said his client planned to fight the charges and denied all of the counts against him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone, any student or otherwise,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Dakmak said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors in exchange for any type of standing within the university or the medical school.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges against Dr. Strampel come as prosecutors pursue a sprawling investigation of the university, which began after Dr. Nassar, a longtime physician for Michigan State and for U.S.A. Gymnastics, admitted sexually abusing young women and was sentenced to prison in hearings that drew international attention. Dozens of women, including Olympic gymnasts, described assaults committed under the guise of medical care. At least 265 people have said they were abused by Dr. Nassar.Prosecutors said Dr. Strampel failed to take steps to protect patients from Dr. Nassar when allegations of abuse emerged. He neglected, the prosecutors said, to follow a set of protocols that would, for instance, have required Dr. Nassar to conduct exams only with other staff members present. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Despite his representation of his (and the college‚<U+0080><U+0099>s) intended response to the allegations against Nassar, Strampel did not actually enforce or monitor these protocols, nor did he alert other employees in the Sports Medicine Clinic about the existence of the protocols,‚<U+0080>ù the charging documents said.The police detective‚<U+0080><U+0099>s affidavit outlining the charges also described a series of disturbing interactions between Dr. Strampel and four female medical students, none of whom were named publicly. In several of the cases, the women said they had gone to meet with Dr. Strampel to discuss their academic work but that he had turned the conversation to other topics.One woman who said she had been summoned to Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office after falling asleep in class said that he told her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>turn around in a circle twice so that he could observe her body,‚<U+0080>ù and that he said that she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.‚<U+0080>ù When she was later called to a dinner honoring scholarship recipients at a club on Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s golf course, she said Dr. Strampel reached around and gripped her buttock as they posed for photos, according to the affidavit.Another student who had failed a medical school test said she was required to meet with Dr. Strampel, who asked her what her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Plan B‚<U+0080>ù was since ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she could not cut it in medical school.‚<U+0080>ù The student said Dr. Strampel told her he would do her a favor by letting her take the exam again, but that she would then be required to do anything for him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given the context,‚<U+0080>ù the affidavit said, the woman ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understood that she was being asked to do anything he wanted sexually in exchange for the favor.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, Dr. Nicole Eastman, who graduated from the school in 2010 and who said that she was interviewed by investigators in the case, said that Dr. Strampel made inappropriate sexual remarks, beginning soon after she started school in 2006.At one point, he told her, laughing and boasting, that it was easy to get women drunk, she said. Another time, she said, he grabbed her buttock at a crowded event, in full view of his wife, who was standing nearby.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I just remember how humiliating it was,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People knew about his behavior, and even if they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t inappropriately touched by him, they knew. And now we know that his behavior enabled Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Eastman said she told a Michigan State employee while she was in school about Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. The employee looked resigned, Dr. Eastman recalled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Everybody knows about his behavior and nothing ever changes,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like a defeated kind of tone. When I think back to that, it was like she felt powerless.‚<U+0080>ùThe charging documents said Dr. Strampel also made graphic sexual comments, solicited nude photos from at least one student, and stored dozens of pornographic images and videos on a computer in his office, including many images that appeared to be of Michigan State students.Rachael Denhollander, who said Dr. Nassar abused her, said Tuesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges reflected a systemic failure at Michigan State.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is shocking but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not shocking,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone like Larry doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get away with becoming the worst sexual abuser in history in plain sight if he were not surrounded by people who had no problem with his conduct and did not think it was a big deal.‚<U+0080>ùMichigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interim president, John Engler, last month took steps to start the process of revoking Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tenure. University officials did not answer questions Tuesday about the status of the revocation, and did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Engler.For years, university officials largely dismissed reports that Dr. Nassar had assaulted women, even though some women said they had reported abuse years ago to coaches, trainers or counselors.On Tuesday, State Senator Margaret O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien, a Republican, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>this university needs to own up to what it did.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just go away,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should know that by now.‚<U+0080>ùOn the campus of Michigan State, students said they were unsettled by the arrest of Dr. Strampel, who came to the College of Osteopathic Medicine in the 1990s after a career that included stints in the surgeon general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and several hospitals.The college enrolls more than 1,200 students and graduates about 300 physicians each year. Graduates earn a D.O. degree instead of the more common M.D., but are full-fledged doctors able to prescribe medication, perform surgeries and choose any specialty. Students also study the osteopathic techniques of manipulating the spine, muscles and bones to diagnose and treat patients.Dr. Strampel, who could face up to nine years in prison if convicted of all charges, arrived at his home outside Lansing after his court appearance on Tuesday afternoon. A woman who came to the door declined to comment.Aly Raisman, an Olympic gymnast who said Dr. Nassar abused her, wrote on Instagram that the charges against Dr. Strampel were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another painful example‚<U+0080>ù of how so much had been mishandled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clear that failing to investigate and understand how this abuse could go on for so long is just asking history to repeat itself,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Raisman, who called for a broader investigation ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that looks into everything, not just Nassar.‚<U+0080>ùAn American swimmer who competed in the 2012 Olympics has accused her former coach of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.The swimmer, Ariana Kukors, 28, said in a statement on Wednesday that the coach, Sean Hutchison, began sexually abusing her when she was 16 and had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>grooming‚<U+0080>ù her for three years before that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kukors said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement emailed by his lawyer, Mr. Hutchison, 46, said Thursday that the accusations were not true. He said that the two had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>committed relationship‚<U+0080>ù that began after she was of age and that they had lived together for more than a year after the 2012 Olympic Games.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to ‚<U+0080><U+0098>groom‚<U+0080><U+0099> her.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her younger sister also lived with us for several months and her mother was a regular visitor to our home,‚<U+0080>ù the statement added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that she would make these wild allegations all these years later.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawyer, Brad Meryhew, said Mr. Hutchison would not comment further.In response to Mr. Hutchison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, B. Robert Allard, one of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers, said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana was groomed and manipulated as a minor by her trusted swim coach. He sexually assaulted her starting when she was 16. This abusive relationship continued until the age of 24. I would hardly characterize this a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>committed relationship‚<U+0080><U+0099> in the sense of two consenting adults who freely and willingly engage in healthy relations. There is nothing healthy about childhood sexual abuse.‚<U+0080>ùThe United States Homeland Security Department is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>still in the very preliminary stages‚<U+0080>ù of an investigation into this case, Lori Haley, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an email on Thursday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But our top priority in all cases involving alleged online child exploitation is identifying any possible minor victims.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Kukors once held the world record for the 200-meter individual medley and has won medals at several international competitions. She competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.Mr. Hutchison has worked with several Olympic swimmers, including the medalists Margaret Hoelzer, Caroline Burckle and Kara Lynn Joyce. He was an assistant coach for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s swimming team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.He met Ms. Kukors when he was a coach at King Aquatic Club in Seattle, according to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement.In a statement on Thursday, Michael Brooks, the head coach at the club, said that news of the allegations ‚<U+0080><U+009C>broke our collective hearts.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana Kukors is part of the King Aquatic family and we only want the best for her,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Brooks said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our staff is meeting to review this devastating news. Sean Hutchison has stepped down as an executive with King and has had no direct interaction with our swimmers for a very long time.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Allard said that U.S.A. Swimming had been given notice in 2010 about the inappropriate coach-athlete relationship but had done nothing.U.S.A. Swimming, the organization that governs the sport in the United States, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became aware of a rumored relationship between Hutchison and then 21-year-old Ariana via a third-party‚<U+0080>ù in 2010. (The organization said Mr. Hutchison does not work for the organization, but he once had a coach membership and remains a nonathlete member.)U.S.A. Swimming said that it conducted an investigation into the rumor in 2010, but that Ms. Kukors and Mr. Hutchison both ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unequivocally denied the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship,‚<U+0080>ù and the case was closed.In light of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, the organization expressed support for her and other victims ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in their quest to break their silence and confront their horrific experiences.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, she realized that she had been abused only ‚<U+0080><U+009C>through recent therapy and after years of suppressing memories of the pain and suffering,‚<U+0080>ù and that she was coming forward with her story on the recommendation of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates.Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement follows on the heels of a dramatic sentencing hearing for Lawrence G. Nassar, a medical professional who was convicted of sexually abusing the young gymnasts, including Olympians, who were his patients. At least 265 girls and women have accused him of abuse, including while an F.B.I. inquiry into the allegations was underway.Uproar over the slow response to the allegations led the board of directors of U.S.A. Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the United States, to resign.The sexual misconduct allegations against the former Fox News host Bill O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly and the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the confidential settlements arising from those accusations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have prompted a provision in the  final tax bill that aims to stem the use of nondisclosure agreements.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, proposed the amendment last month. It says any settlement, payout or lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse could not be deducted as a business expense if such payments were subject to a nondisclosure agreement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think most Americans would be outraged to know that they are subsidizing sexual predators in the tax code,‚<U+0080>ù he said in an emailed statement.But the proposed changes may not deter some companies and businesses from seeking confidentiality.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a nudge, not a hammer,‚<U+0080>ù Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an expert in tax policy, said in a phone interview on Saturday.Publicly known sexual harassment settlements involving Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who is said to have used nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have totaled about $45 million, including a $32 million payout that he paid personally.Mr. Weinstein, whose abuse of women was exposed by The New York Times in October, also has used confidentiality agreements. The Times reported that Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment.Under the tax bill spearheaded by Republicans, a hypothetical company that paid a $10 million sexual abuse settlement would not be able to take a deduction on that amount if the payout had a nondisclosure agreement attached to it.In the absence of a confidentiality agreement, however, the new corporate tax rate would allow the company to save $2.1 million in taxes, making its out-of-pocket cost $7.9 million.For a business that generates billions in revenue, like the parent company of Fox News, a nondisclosure agreement can have far more value than tax savings.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new rules are very well-intentioned, but the impact is likely to only be symbolic,‚<U+0080>ù Gordon Klein, a lawyer, certified public accountant and faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Anderson School of Management, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The reason for that is companies cherish nondisclosure agreements because they significantly help protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and protect them from follow-on lawsuits or additional lawsuits.‚<U+0080>ùThe nonspecific language of the amendment also complicated matters, Mr. Klein said.The bill refers to settlements or payments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>related‚<U+0080>ù to sexual harassment or sexual abuse, he said, but what if only one portion of the allegations is about sexual harassment? And does it matter if the sexual harassment was merely an allegation, or does there need to be evidence of sexual harassment? Are the lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees limited to the time spent drafting the settlement, or to all of the fees associated with the settlement?Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, proposed a similar amendment for the House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tax reform bill but it did not include a stipulation about confidentiality agreements.In the end, the language in the Senate bill offered by Mr. Menendez made the final cut when lawmakers blended the two bills together. Democrats have heavily criticized the proposed tax bill and complained they were shut out of the legislative process.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the reason, in all honestly, why there was no pushback was because it was a revenue generator,‚<U+0080>ù Tricia Enright, Mr. Menendez‚<U+0080><U+0099>s press secretary, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They determined that it would be seen on the plus-side of the ledger.‚<U+0080>ùWhile the new tax plan would allow businesses to write off legal fees related to sexual harassment payouts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> provided they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not tied to nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it is a different situation for employees who make claims of sexual abuse or harassment.In those cases, plaintiffs will no longer be able to write off their legal fees. A plaintiff could ordinarily claim such an expense as an itemized deduction, but the Republican plan has eliminated that option, Mr. Hemel said, adding that it creates ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a one-sidedness.‚<U+0080>ùROME ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After his spirited defense of a Chilean bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse prompted the greatest crisis of his pontificate, Pope Francis reactivated an abuse commission on Saturday that had lapsed into dormancy.It was the latest in a series of measures by the Vatican to counter criticism that fighting abuse was not a priority for Francis‚<U+0080><U+0099> papacy.Cardinal Sean O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley of Boston was reappointed as the leader of the group, called the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. A Vatican statement said the panel would include some victims of clerical sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm,‚<U+0080>ù Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley said in a statement.The Vatican statement said the abuse victims on the commission preferred to keep their histories private.The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December, and its lapsing coincided with growing criticism of the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to addressing sexual abuse in the church. The group plans to begin its work in April by hearing the testimony of abuse victims.The Vatican statement said the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s goal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and greatest challenge‚<U+0080>ù remained embedding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>abuse prevention and protection into the life and action of local churches.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement about the commission came on the same day that the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most experienced sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, was expected to take testimony in New York from Juan Carlos Cruz, who says that he was sexually abused when he was a teenager in Chile by a priest and that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had witnessed the abuse.While visiting Chile last month, the pope initially defended Bishop Barros as a victim of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>calumny,‚<U+0080>ù saying that the Vatican had received no concrete evidence against the bishop.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,‚<U+0080>ù Francis said at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander.‚<U+0080>ùThe comments caused outrage in Chile, and Francis, amid intense pressure, dispatched Archbishop Scicluna to investigate.On Thursday, the Civilt√† Cattolica, a Jesuit journal, published the private remarks the pope made during a visit to Peru last month, in which he disclosed that he regularly met with victims of sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father meets victims of sexual abuse, either individually or in groups, several times a month,‚<U+0080>ù Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman, confirmed in a statement. He added that the pope ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tries to help them heal the grave wounds caused by the abuses they suffered.‚<U+0080>ùMany advocates for abuse survivors accused the pope of opening up a wound by saying there was no evidence that Bishop Barros had covered up abuse. It then emerged that the pope had personally received an eight-page letter in 2015 containing testimony against the bishop, and that Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley had delivered it.Eight members of the commission were reappointed, and nine others are new to the panel. Its experts, which include lay academics and psychologists, priests and nuns, come from several countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Tonga. Ten are non-clerics and eight are women, including three nuns.Two abuse survivors previously left the commission in frustration. And the pope did not reappoint six lay members who advocates for the abused considered among the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most active leaders.CHARLOTTE, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Back in court Wednesday for his third and final sentencing hearing, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports clinic doctor, heard statements from more than 20 accusers, many of whom shared accounts of sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar at a local gymnastics club known for grooming stars.Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers include elite athletes, such as the Olympic medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas. But the speakers in court on Wednesday were not global superstars. They were mostly regular teenagers who told of being charmed by Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strange laugh‚<U+0080>ù and by the autographed posters of revered gymnasts on the walls of his office at the Michigan State sports clinic.Twistars Gymnastics Club, outside Lansing, Mich., was supposed to catapult young female athletes to a fruitful career, under the guidance of John Geddert, who owned the gym and coached there. Instead it became a site of anguish and devastation, according to the statements, some of which described long-lasting injuries, both mental and physical, inflicted by the doctor known as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>healer of gymnasts.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, more than 150 young women and teenagers finished publicly confronting Dr. Nassar during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. He has received sentences of 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography and of 40 to 175 years for the sexual abuse charges in Ingham County.Starting Wednesday, 65 women were scheduled to speak here in Eaton County Circuit Court this week. The judge, Janice K. Cunningham, said that the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265, some of whom chose to remain anonymous.Unlike the Ingham County judge, Rosemarie E. Aquilina, whose frequent commentary throughout the hearing there was met with a mix of praise and disapproval, Judge Cunningham kept her comments concise and subdued, primarily expressing appreciation for the victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> bravery.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is almost beyond comprehension to listen to young women in high school to stand at that podium and come forward with their story,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Dr. Nassar, wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, remained stoic with his head hanging low throughout the first day of the hearing, which included statements from 29 of the accusers, 22 of whom had not previously offered a statement in Ingham County.The first speaker, Jessica Thomashow, said she had been assaulted by Dr. Nassar as early as age 9, at Twistars.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The way it worked at Twistars was that, if you were injured, you were specifically instructed to see Larry Nassar, not your family doctor,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Thomashow said. She recalled being excited to see the famed Dr. Nassar for a rib injury.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into the back room and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when everything changed,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to the room Dr. Nassar used at Twistars.Another victim, Bailey Lorencen, whose statement was read for her, referred to Twistars‚<U+0080><U+0099> back room as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dungeon.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is clear that in an environment like Twistars, a monster like Nassar would thrive,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lorencen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said.Dr. Nassar pleaded guilty here in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13, according to a plea agreement.The agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011, some of it under the guise of medical treatment. A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars.Dr. Nassar will be sentenced after the victims speak. The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the counts.The case has reverberated in the sports world, and it led to the resignation of the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board of directors.At Michigan State, the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president, after the longtime president Lou Anna Simon resigned last week. But Mr. Engler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appointment has already been met with student protests, and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faculty senate is debating a vote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no confidence‚<U+0080>ù in the board. The vote could come as soon as next week.The stories told Wednesday by the young women and by athletes‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents, some of whom had been in the room while Dr. Nassar abused their daughters, painted an image of a dark side in gymnastics culture. Many of the victims said the pressure to rise in the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ranks had contributed to their decisions not to report the abuse sooner.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I kept thinking, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a doctor, stop overreacting,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Katherine Ebert said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t overreacting.‚<U+0080>ùMadison Bonofiglio, whose statement was read by Angela Povilaitis, the assistant attorney general, said she had dismissed her feelings while she was being abused for fear of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>upsetting‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are judged by your body, your looks, your cuteness factor, and then your skill,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.The young women said that they were told they had no choice but to see Dr. Nassar and that he had lulled them into trusting him. He lit the fireplace to keep athletes warm when ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treating‚<U+0080>ù them in his basement, where the abuse often occurred, they said. Dr. Nassar often gave gifts, such as souvenir pins, necklaces and treats, according to some of the statements.Amy Preston, the mother of a 19-year-old who was abused by Dr. Nassar as a child, said he had brought the girl waffles with fresh berries and whipped cream. He often consoled gymnasts when Mr. Geddert screamed at them, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>John, you tried to teach our girls to be quiet and obey,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Preston said in court, apparently referring to Mr. Geddert. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We now stand before them and say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Speak.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A. sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University, formally opening an investigation into how the university handled the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, the doctor who sexually assaulted scores of female athletes.Dr. Nassar spent decades on the faculty at the university and treated its athletes, as well as members of the United States national gymnastics team.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has requested information from Michigan State about any potential rules violations,‚<U+0080>ù Donald M. Remy, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief legal officer, said in a phone interview Tuesday evening.N.C.A.A. bylaws require colleges to protect the health, safety and well-being of athletes. Among those who have said Dr. Nassar abused them are members of the Michigan State cross country and softball teams. Kathie Klages, the former gymnastics coach who retired last year, has been accused of seeking to cover up allegations against Dr. Nassar, who served as team physician for the university gymnastics and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crew programs.In a statement late Tuesday, the association said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential N.C.A.A. rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State. We will have no further comment at this time.‚<U+0080>ùA Michigan State spokesman said Tuesday night that the university was reviewing the letter before issuing a response.On Wednesday, Michigan State released the N.C.A.A‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter, which was addressed to Athletic Director Mark Hollis and copied to President Lou Anna Simon. Referring to Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>heinous and appalling assaults,‚<U+0080>ù it cited the principle of athlete wellbeing and a by-law that it said pertained to that principle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s heinous crimes of record against more than 150 victims raise serious concerns about institutional practices, student-athlete safety and the institution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions to protect individuals from his behavior.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement Wednesday, Hollis pledged a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>comprehensive response‚<U+0080>ù to the letter and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation. Of college athletes, he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety.‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A., the governing body of intercollegiate athletics, was widely criticized several years ago for its handling of a case involving Penn State University in which Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant football coach, sexually abused young boys. (Sandusky is serving a decades-long prison term.)Less than a year after the Penn State scandal became public in the fall of 2011, an independent investigation commissioned by Penn State, and led by Louis J. Freeh, helped lead to N.C.A.A. sanctions, including a $60 million fine and the vacating of more than 100 wins from the lifetime record of the former head coach Joe Paterno, who died earlier that year. Several of the penalties were later rescinded, and the wins restored.Critics contended that the N.C.A.A. had overstepped its bounds with those penalties. Emails made public because of a lawsuit two years later appeared to show N.C.A.A. officials questioning whether their institution had the authority to issue such penalties on a university, even one where several high-ranking officials later received jail time for their roles in covering up Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse.In one email, an N.C.A.A. official referred to the consent decree between the association and Penn State as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bluff‚<U+0080>ù and urged a settlement because the N.C.A.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chances of proving a violation of its bylaws before a Committee on Infractions might prove difficult.Last year, an N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions demonstrated just how narrow those bylaws can be when it declined to penalize the University of North Carolina over a scandal in which scores of dubious classes were taken disproportionally by football and men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basketball players. Through gritted teeth, the committee said it could not find an N.C.A.A. violation because the classes had been available to all students.The Nassar case has drawn comparisons to the Sandusky case, raising questions about how university officials responded to warning signs about federal crimes being committed on their campus and about whether they tried to protect someone who was considered valuable to the athletics program. The Michigan State University police received a report about Dr. Nassar as early as May 2014, and on Tuesday a former rower at Michigan State said she had received no response to two separate reports of abuse by Nassar.Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon, a former chair of what is now known as the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors, has faced calls for resignation, though the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s board has largely supported her.The Nassar case has been pushed further into the national spotlight over the past week as Judge Rosemarie Aquilina has allowed more than 140 women, and others connected to the case, to speak at a sentencing hearing for Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to multiple sex crimes and has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. On Monday, three leading members of the board of U.S.A. Gymnastics, which also employed Dr. Nassar for years, resigned amid increasing criticism of how they responded to reports of his abuse.Several voices ordinarily critical of the N.C.A.A. have urged the organization to stay away from the allegations against Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are always mindful of the voices around college athletics,‚<U+0080>ù Remy said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and we strive to do the right thing.‚<U+0080>ùAt the N.C.A.A. Convention last week in Indianapolis, Mark Emmert, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, conspicuously did not mention Michigan State in his annual address, even as he alluded to the U.N.C. scandal and the under-the-table payments in men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s college basketball that federal officials revealed last fall. Emmert told members of the news media at the convention that he did not have enough information on what happened at Michigan State to comment on it in-depth.However, in his address Emmert rebutted the notion that the N.C.A.A. should steer clear of controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dance around those things,‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to various scandals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t make excuses for it. We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say our process is slow.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do we respond? I think, first of all, by not retreating from it, not getting under our desks not hiding from it.‚<U+0080>ùCardinal George Pell, the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s third-highest-ranking official, arrived at a Melbourne court on Monday for the start of several weeks of hearings to determine whether he will face trial on charges of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ùPolice officers lined the sidewalk, as a large contingent of the local and international journalists and members of the public watched the cardinal enter the Melbourne Magistrates‚<U+0080><U+0099> Court.The slow-moving case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> charges were filed in June ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will be a test of both Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s justice system and the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to hold clerics accountable after decades of abuse scandals. Witness testimony began on Monday and is expected to continue for two weeks, during which time the court will be closed to the news media and the public.Here is a guide to what we know, what we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and how the case will be shaped by Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s court system.The son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Melbourne Response,‚<U+0080>ù a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell appeared in court on Monday wearing a black suit and clerical collar and did not speak during the initial session.Read:  How Cardinal Pell Rose to Power, Trailed by a Cloud of ScandalRead:  George Pell, Aide to Pope, Is Put on Defensive in Abuse InquiryCardinal Pell has been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ù No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and ‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses. However, nothing has been made public about the details ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not the number of accusers, not the time frame of the accusations, nor the severity of the acts at the center of the case.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said at a news conference in Rome last June.During Monday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hearing, the prosecution requested amendments to certain charges and requested that emotional support dogs be available to witnesses who testified via video link.Read: Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual AssaultRead: Vatican Sex Abuse Scandal Reveals Blind Spot for Francis Expected to run for four weeks, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committal hearing will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to trial.All relevant evidence will be presented to the magistrate by the prosecution, including witness testimony.Local news outlets have reported that up to 50 witnesses could be called during the hearing process. The court heard last year that some of the witnesses were choir boys at the time of the alleged incidents.All witnesses can be subject to cross-examination by the defense ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a noteworthy detail because Robert Richter, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, has a reputation for a withering and aggressive approach.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to demonstrate that what was alleged was impossible,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Richter told the court last October.Even if the magistrate decides that there is not sufficient evidence to proceed, Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.The hearing‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proceedings are largely conducted outside of public view. Reporters are being granted access for the first day of the hearing but will not be allowed to return to cover actual testimony.Read:  Cardinal George Pell Returns to Australia, Charged With Sexual OffensesAustralian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.The country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s contempt standards prohibit reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after charges have been filed and before a verdict has been reached ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that might be seen as prejudicial against or for a defendant.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information on a wide range of topics including: specific accusations against an individual, prior convictions and affiliations with convicted criminals, and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case.All news media organizations in Australia are subject to this restriction, which has the potential to create vast differences in articles about the case published from inside or outside Australia.Suppression orders are also used in many cases to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even the existence of a suppression order can be banned from publication, meaning that journalists cannot report precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage. These are sometimes referred to as superinjunctions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quite often, orders will be made to protect the fairness of the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial,‚<U+0080>ù said Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, whose research has focused on court proceedings. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the main purpose of an order.‚<U+0080>ùBut, he added, such orders are often approved without rigorous scrutiny about whether they are in fact necessary.In a report published before Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case began, Mr. Bosland wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Open justice is increasingly being undermined in Victoria due to the inappropriate use of suppression orders by the courts.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem in Australia is that the courts tend to make orders that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t comply with the strict requirements of the law.‚<U+0080>ùRead:  Suppression Orders Vs. Open JusticeCORYDON, Ind. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A southern Indiana elementary school teacher faces three dozen counts of child molestation that occurred over a three-year period, authorities said Monday.A not-guilty plea was entered on behalf of Corey Faith, 40, during an initial hearing in Harrison Superior Court. The Corydon man was being held at the Harrison County Jail on a $250,000 cash-only bond.Faith admitted the incidents of molestation occurred from 2005 to 2007 in his home, his classroom at New Middletown Elementary School in Corydon and elsewhere, Harrison County Prosecutor Otto Schalk said.A probable cause affidavit said the alleged victim was 12 years old when the molestations began. She had been a student of Faith's when he taught sixth grade. He most recently taught third grade.Court records said the investigation began March 19 when the Harrison County Sheriff's Department received a tip from a friend of the alleged victim after she spoke of multiple sexual encounters with Faith when she was under 14 years old.The South Harrison Community School Corp. delivered notice Monday of its intent to fire Faith. It issued a statement saying it was ""deeply saddened to learn of the events and critical lapses"" in judgment by Faith that occurred.Online court records didn't list an attorney for Faith.The team doctor accused of molesting scores of young athletes while working with the United States gymnastics team and Michigan State University pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault on Wednesday in Ingham County (Mich.) Circuit Court. He is expected to face at least 25 years in prison.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, 54, was charged with the molestation of seven girls, most of whom were gymnasts, but he has been accused of various levels of inappropriate or abusive sexual behavior by a group of more than 130 women and girls, including the Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas.Sentencing is set for Jan. 12. The victims will have an opportunity to speak.In a brief statement on Wednesday, Dr. Nassar said he made the plea ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to move the community forward and stop the hurting.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I pray every day for forgiveness,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Judge Rosemarie Aquilina responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You used your position of trust in the most vile way: to abuse children. I agree that now is a time of healing, but it may take them a lifetime of healing while you spend your life behind bars thinking of what you did by taking away their childhood.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The agreement which was placed on the record today was reached after extensive negotiations with the prosecution and with significant input from Larry Nassar. This agreement resolves all the charged and uncharged conduct for more than 125 cases currently under investigation by the Michigan Attorney General‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office.‚<U+0080>ùDuring the hearing Ms. Raisman sent out a Twitter message describing Dr. Nassar as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>monster.‚<U+0080>ùThe girls involved in this specific plea agreement testified that Dr. Nassar molested them, sometimes with their parents present, while they were seeking treatment for sports-related injuries. Complaints against Dr. Nassar reportedly go back 20 years, but USA gymnastics fired him in 2015, which is when the organization claims to have been made aware of the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He convinced these girls that this was some type of legitimate treatment,‚<U+0080>ù Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis told a judge last summer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why would they question him? Why would they question this gymnastics god?‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman, who was the captain of the teams that took home gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, has been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most vocal public critics, and has fiercely argued that the victims of the case should be blameless, despite some criticism they have received for waiting extended periods of time before reporting the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù she said in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes‚<U+0080>ù this month. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùAfter Ms. Raisman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement, and her subsequent commentary, Ms. Douglas, who had competed alongside her in both Olympics, posted a tweet that quoted a message from Ms. Raisman about the abuse. Ms. Douglas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s post included her own comment, which read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>however it is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd.‚<U+0080>ùThe comment was widely attacked as victim shaming, with Simone Biles, the 2016 all-around gold medalist, showing her disappointment in a post to Twitter in which she said it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shocks me that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m seeing this but it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t surprise me.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Douglas has attempted to walk back the post, saying it was misinterpreted and that victims are always blameless. In her clarifications she revealed that she, too, had been one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.Ms. Maroney was the first of the gold medal-winning gymnasts to publicly accuse Dr. Nassar when she revealed details of her abuse in October, and Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist from the 2000 team, was among the initial group of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers last year.While Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legal situation appears to be resolved in Ingham County, he faces similar charges in Eaton County, the location of an elite gymnastics club. He is also awaiting sentencing after having pleaded guilty in federal court on child pornography charges.On a flight from Seattle to San Jose, Calif., on Monday, a woman caught a glimpse of some text messages that alarmed her.A man seated in front of her on the Southwest Airlines flight was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>texting about sexually molesting young children,‚<U+0080>ù  the San Jose Police Department said in a news release.The man, identified by police as Michael Kellar, 56, of Tacoma, Wash., was using a large smartphone with enlarged text, making it easier for her to read his messages and take photographs of them.The woman alerted a member of the flight crew, who notified police officers working in the Mineta San Jose International Airport. Mr. Kellar was arrested after the plane landed.The woman is a preschool teacher, said Detective Sgt. Brian Spears, commander of the San Jose Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely a hero in our eyes,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Kellar was charged with attempted child molestation and solicitation of a sex crime, both felonies. He was arraigned on Thursday and was being held without bail at the Santa Clara County Jail.Police named Gail Burnworth, 50, also a resident of Tacoma, as the person Mr. Kellar was suspected of texting. They have also located two children, ages 5 and 7, who may have been victims of sexual abuse.Sergeant Spears said the text messages ‚<U+0080><U+009C>described specific sex acts performed on children, as well as bestiality.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It definitely goes beyond just that flight,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a history of conversations between them.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to a statement from the city of Seattle on Wednesday, it seems that Ms. Burnworth ‚<U+0080><U+009C>had access to the children either as a caregiver or babysitter.‚<U+0080>ù She was arrested in Tacoma on Monday but was released after prosecutors did not formally charge her within 72 hours.She was arrested again on Friday night on a federal warrant for conspiracy to produce child pornography.Southwest Airlines did not provide access to the crew member who alerted police because of the criminal investigation. In an emailed statement, it said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We always encourage customers to say something to our employees or law enforcement if they see something suspicious.‚<U+0080>ùThe authorities in California and Washington said federal charges are likely, and the F.B.I. was involved in the continuing investigation.Capt. Mike Edwards, commander of the Seattle Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said the two children who may have been victims remained at their home with their parents.Police did not identify the teacher who reported the text messages. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re very grateful that she was on that plane,‚<U+0080>ù Captain Edwards said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the big message and the big takeaway on this is, for all of us, is to pay attention to what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going on around you,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You never know how important it could be.‚<U+0080>ùHARRISBURG, Pa. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A judge on Friday sentenced three former Pennsylvania State University officials, including a former president, to short jail terms followed by home confinement for their roles in the child molestation scandal that rocked the university.In March, a jury found Graham B. Spanier, the former president, guilty of one misdemeanor count of endangering the welfare of a child, and not guilty of two other charges. His lawyers have said he will appeal the conviction, and they argued for a sentence of probation rather than jail time.The officials were charged for failing to go to law enforcement after being told in 2001 that a former assistant football coach, Jerry Sandusky, had been seen molesting a boy in a locker room shower. The officials denied that they were told at the time that the episode in the shower was overtly sexual.Mr. Sandusky went on to assault several other minors, and in 2012, he was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.It is very rare for prosecutors to try to hold university leaders criminally liable for the misconduct of others, and the case is all the more remarkable for involving one of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most prominent universities, and one of its most vaunted football programs.It has been a stunning downfall for Mr. Spanier, 68, who had spoken publicly about his own history of being abused as a child by his father, who beat him severely. He served for 16 years as president of Penn State, until he was forced out in 2011, and had earned a reputation as a skilled, energetic administrator who sometimes went too far in stifling criticism of the university.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The single most important thing I can say is that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080>ù he told the court on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that I did not intervene far more carefully.‚<U+0080>ùIn handing down the sentence in Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, Judge John Boccabella said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a Shakespearean tragedy; this is a fall from grace that is both unfortunate and well deserved.‚<U+0080>ùThe defendants are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good people who made a terrible mistake,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why no one made a phone call to police is beyond me.‚<U+0080>ùLaura Ditka, the deputy state attorney general who was the lead prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Spanier had chosen to protect his and Penn State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputations, rather than protect children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is inexcusable,‚<U+0080>ù she said.The case also badly damaged the reputation of Joe Paterno, the revered head football coach, who was accused of knowing about allegations against Mr. Sandusky. He was fired in 2011, after 45 years, and died a few months later.The university has paid tens of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits filed by Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, and the total could eventually exceed $100 million. Mr. Spanier has also sued the university.Gary Schultz, formerly a senior vice president of the university, and Tim Curley, a former athletic director, were charged along with Mr. Spanier. They pleaded guilty to related charges and testified at the trial of Mr. Spanier, who refused a plea deal.Mr. Spanier‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers had argued that he should not get jail time, in part because of health problems. Prosecutors said he should receive a penalty in the upper part of the allowable range for the conviction, which carries a maximum sentence of one year.Judge Boccabella sentenced Mr. Spanier to four to 12 months‚<U+0080><U+0099> confinement, with at least two months of that in jail followed by home confinement, and a $7,500 fine. He sentenced Mr. Curley to seven to 23 months, with at least three months in jail, and a $5,000 fine; and Mr. Schultz to six to 23 months, with at least two months in jail, and a $5,000 fine. In addition, he imposed two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> probation on all three men.The judge said he was not convinced that Mr. Spanier was as culpable as the other two.Mr. Spanier, who arrived at the courthouse holding hands with his wife, Sandra, remained impassive throughout, and he and his lawyers declined to answer questions as they left. But Mr. Curley and Mr. Schultz made emotional appeals for leniency before the sentences were handed down.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sickens me to think that I might have played a part in children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s suffering,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schultz said.A founder of the now-disbanded Minuteman border patrol group has been convicted in Arizona of molesting a 5-year-old girl, bringing to an end a case that gained the attention of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s highest court after he tried to cross-examine the young victim.The defendant, Christopher Simcox, 55, was found guilty Wednesday of molesting the girl, who was a friend of his 6-year-old daughter, between April 21, 2012, and May 23, 2013, during visits to his apartment,  the Maricopa County attorney, Bill Montgomery, said in a statement. Mr. Simcox was in the process of divorcing his wife at the time.The girl told her mother of the abuse, and her mother called law enforcement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The defendant preyed upon a young child while she was meant to be in his care,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This young girl had the courage to come forward to stop the abuse and by doing so revealed his predatory behavior. With this verdict, we have been able to seek justice for this victim.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Simcox was found guilty of two counts of molestation of a child and one count of furnishing obscene materials to a minor, the statement said. He was also accused of sexual conduct with another child, but was found not guilty of that charge, Mr. Montgomery said.Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial took an unexpected turn that could have an impact on future case law. Although he is not a lawyer, Mr. Simcox represented himself and sought to question the girls he was accused of molesting.But prosecutors brought in an expert to address the trauma it would cause the victims, and they took action in lower courts to block Mr. Simcox, eventually filing a petition that is now before the United States Supreme Court.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ultimately, the defendant backed down from his insistence on personally carrying out the cross-examination of his victims and allowed his advisory attorney to question the victims,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Montgomery said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though the issue is now moot in this case, it is still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court because of its legal significance.‚<U+0080>ùKerrie Droban, who served as Mr. Simcox‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advisory counsel, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that she had questioned the girls instead, while Mr. Simcox was allowed during the trial to question two children who were witnesses.Mr. Simcox will be sentenced on July 5. Consecutive mandatory sentences could be tantamount to a life in prison, Ms. Droban said.Mr. Simcox was a former high-profile advocate for tougher control of borders and undocumented day laborers, joining watch groups and speaking out at public events, like one in Farmingville on Long Island in 2003.He was a founder of a volunteer armed watch group, Civil Homeland Defense, which was created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and intercepted undocumented immigrants crossing into Arizona, turning them over to the authorities. Later, he helped form the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, which stepped into the national spotlight in 2005 with high-profile border patrols.The Southern Poverty Law Center said Mr. Simcox, a former kindergarten teacher, was among the movement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most charismatic figures, affecting the likeness of a vigilante with a pistol tucked into the front of his jeans.In 2012, Mr. Simcox told the center, which was investigating the possible involvement of extremist groups in the killings of Mexicans crossing the Arizona border, that he had left the movement and was living a quiet life tutoring schoolchildren in suburban Phoenix.When the verdict in his trial was announced on Wednesday, the mother of the then-5-year-old girl dabbed her eyes with tissue, The Arizona Republic reported.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was convicted on at least one, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s all we need,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This conviction is for all of the children that he hurt.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have words,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s over. I can go home and tell my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùFor more than a year, an F.B.I. inquiry into allegations that Lawrence G. Nassar, a respected sports doctor, had molested three elite teenage gymnasts followed a plodding pace as it moved back and forth among agents in three cities. The accumulating information included instructional videos of the doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unusual treatment methods, showing his ungloved hands working about the private areas of girls lying facedown on tables.But as the inquiry moved with little evident urgency, a cost was being paid. The New York Times has identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he first fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by an Indianapolis Star investigation. Some are among the youngest of the now-convicted predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s many accusers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 265, and counting.The three alleged victims then at the center of the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inquiry were world-class athletes; two were Olympic gold medalists. Nearly a year passed before agents interviewed two of the young women.The silence at times drove the victims and their families to distraction, including Gina Nichols, the mother of the gymnast initially known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Athlete A‚<U+0080>ù: Maggie Nichols, who was not contacted by the F.B.I. for nearly 11 months after the information she provided sparked the federal inquiry.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never got a phone call from the police or the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ù during that time, Gina Nichols, a registered nurse, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not one person. Not one. Not one. Not one.‚<U+0080>ùThe F.B.I. declined to answer detailed questions about the speed and nature of its investigation, or to provide an official who might put the case in context. Instead, it issued a 112-word statement asserting that the sexual exploitation of children ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is an especially heinous crime,‚<U+0080>ù and that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the safety and well-being of our youth is a top priority for the F.B.I.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also said that the many allegations against Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+009C>transcended jurisdictions‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an apparent suggestion that internal efforts to coordinate among its bureaus and with other law enforcement agencies partly explained the inquiry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s slow tempo.The agency left unaddressed the oft-repeated claim by U.S.A. Gymnastics officials that after initially presenting the sexual assault allegations to the F.B.I. in July 2015, they came away with the impression that federal agents had advised them not to discuss the case with anyone. The ensuing silence had dire consequences, as the many girls and young women still seeing Dr. Nassar received no warning.Among them was Emma Ann Miller.By the summer of 2015, Emma Ann, the only child of a single mother, was both a competitive dancer and just another Michigan kid immersed in the joys and dramas of middle school life. She got braces, with baby blue rubber bands that matched her eyes. She began receiving Snapchat attention from boys.And once a month, she went to Suite 420 in a six-story office building close to Michigan State University in East Lansing, where her solicitous doctor, who encouraged everyone to just call him Larry, molested her.According to her lawyer, Emma Ann had about a dozen sessions with Dr. Nassar between the summers of 2015 and 2016. The pain of the procedures increased, and her self-confidence plummeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whenever he asked if my lower back hurt, he would always find a way to touch me down there,‚<U+0080>ù she said, explaining that Dr. Nassar would say that her pelvis was in need of adjustment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Whether or not I said my back hurt, he would always find a way to, to. ‚<U+0080>¶‚<U+0080>ùThe young girl paused.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve blocked out a lot of what he did to me,‚<U+0080>ù she said finally.Only three years ago, Dr. Nassar was a popular doctor among the athletes he treated for U.S.A. Gymnastics, known for being goofy but maybe a bit too attentive. His treatments, which gymnastics officials believed were at the cutting edge, were also in demand at Michigan State, where he worked, as well as at Holt High School, and at a gymnastics academy called Twistars.Issues had cropped up: a parent raising concerns about his behavior at Twistars; a female athlete or two at Michigan State complaining to no avail about inappropriate exams. In 2014, a university investigation of another complaint cleared Dr. Nassar of misconduct, but he was now required to have a third person present when treatment involved sensitive areas of the body ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and to wear gloves.Still, the doctor was trusted enough to conduct his procedures ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intravaginal adjustment‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> without supervision when treating the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s best gymnasts at the Karolyi ranch, the exclusive and secluded national team training camp, about 60 miles north of Houston. Gymnasts of international caliber, like Ms. Nichols, of suburban Minneapolis, would spend a week each month at the ranch, under the exacting supervision of the revered coach Martha Karolyi.But at the ranch in late spring of 2015, Ms. Nichols‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal coach, Sarah Jantzi, overheard the 17-year-old girl talking with another elite gymnast, Aly Raisman, about Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s invasive and inappropriate techniques. The alarming information was quickly shared with the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents and, by June 17, with officials at U.S.A. Gymnastics.Gina Nichols, Maggie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, recalled telling Steve Penny, then the president of U.S.A. Gymnastics, that the police had to be called immediately. But he insisted that she not tell anyone, she said. The organization would take care of alerting law enforcement.Weeks of silence passed, Gina Nichols said, interrupted occasionally by admonitions from Mr. Penny to keep quiet about the matter ‚<U+0080><U+0094> although the United States Olympic Committee has said that U.S.A. Gymnastics reported that one of its physicians had been accused of abusing athletes ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and was in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement authorities.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics eventually retained what it called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an experienced female investigator‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a specialist in workplace harassment. After completing her interviews, the investigator recommended on Friday, July 24, that Dr. Nassar be reported to law enforcement.Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman competed the next day at the U.S. Classic in Chicago. Gina Nichols said that she saw Mr. Penny at the event and that he told her: We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re working on this. Keep it quiet.On Monday, July 27, gymnastics officials contacted the F.B.I. in Indianapolis, where U.S.A. Gymnastics has its headquarters. The next day, its chairman, Paul Parilla, and its president, Mr. Penny, met with F.B.I. agents who, they later said, assured them they had come to the right place. Forty-one days had passed since U.S.A. Gymnastics first received the report of the sexual abuse of one of its charges.At this moment, F.B.I. agents in Indianapolis were also immersed in the child-exploitation case of Jared Fogle, the longtime pitchman on Subway television ads. Mr. Fogle was arrested that summer on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child and distribution of child pornography, and later sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison.The gymnastics officials provided the agents with contact information for three gymnasts: Ms. Nichols, Ms. Raisman and someone emerging as the central complainant: McKayla Maroney, then 19, a retired Olympic gold medalist who by the summer of 2015 had become a minor celebrity, struggling in public to find her next purpose in life ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a struggle she has since indicated was related to serious emotional issues stemming from the abuse.They also turned over copies of videos of Dr. Nassar demonstrating his technique as he chatted clinically about pulled hamstrings, buttocks and trigger points. Reporters for The New York Times have seen the videos, which show him kneading the legs of girls before his ungloved hands begin to work under a towel, between the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> legs.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not a fun place to dig,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar says to the camera.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do the hand-shaky thing,‚<U+0080>ù he adds later, demonstrating how he shakes his hand vigorously when it is deep between a girl‚<U+0080><U+0099>s legs.W. Jay Abbott, who at the time was the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. bureau in Indianapolis, said on Thursday that while he did not watch the videos, he vividly remembered the reactions of colleagues who had.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will never forget sitting around the table and thinking, What?‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Abbott, who retired in January. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the reaction of my special agents who were very well versed in this was one of disgust. That is why we worked it with such urgency.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At the time, it was being portrayed as a legitimate medical procedure. But to the layman, like ourselves, we were ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to be kidding me.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe next day, U.S.A. Gymnastics quietly, even surreptitiously, relieved Dr. Nassar of any further assignments. It later issued a statement saying: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>U.S.A. Gymnastics understood from its meeting with the F.B.I. that it should not take any action nor communicate anything that might interfere with the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation.‚<U+0080>ùAll the while, Dr. Nassar continued his uncommon treatment techniques on young patients.Emma Ann Miller remembers the summer of 2015 as her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>best summer ever.‚<U+0080>ùShe competed in a dance competition in Las Vegas, where she performed to a song from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Legally Blonde,‚<U+0080>ù and won a trophy that was two and a half feet tall ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about half her height. She spent time at a sleep-away Bible camp, where she went kayaking, horseback riding and zip-lining, and had water balloon fights.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We T.P.‚<U+0080><U+0099>ed the boys‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabin down the hill and had a Silly String fight with two of the other girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said with a laugh. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone threw a frog into one of the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins. It was so much fun.‚<U+0080>ùBut then there were those monthly visits to the office of Dr. Nassar ‚<U+0080><U+0094> doctor to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all of these super-high-up Olympians‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who had treated her mother for years for injuries related to a car accident. Given that Emma Ann had known him her entire life, he was almost like family, an intimacy reflected in the half-dozen photographs of her that he displayed in his treatment room.Dr. Nassar first molested her when she was 10, she recalled. She remembered the pants she was wearing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> black leggings with white flowers, from A√©ropostale. She was having back and neck issues, and he had her remove the leggings and put on loose shorts. In a medical supply room that doubled as a treatment room, he began exploring ‚<U+0080><U+009C>down there.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Is this O.K.?‚<U+0080><U+0099> and I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And he was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Just hang in there.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how it felt. I just knew that it hurt.‚<U+0080>ùIn the summer of 2015, the treatments hurt even more. She had tried wearing three pairs of underpants or especially tight shorts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> anything to keep Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fingers from probing her. Now that she was older, she began lying that she was having her period.At some point, Emma Ann told her mother that she preferred not to be alone with Dr. Nassar. That did not end it. She said he continued to abuse her while positioning himself so that her mother couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t see what he was doing. He would grope the girl beneath a white towel meant to convey propriety, all the while chatting with her mother, a kindergarten teacher.How‚<U+0080><U+0099>s your class going?‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew that he had helped my mom, so I had to persuade myself into thinking that he also helped me,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really sure.‚<U+0080>ùEmma Ann now knows that she was not alone. The growing number of other girls who say they were being molested between the summers of 2015 and 2016 includes Alexis Alvarado, 19, who began seeing Dr. Nassar in 2010 for a stress fracture in her back. He began that treatment by massaging her legs, but then his hands crept up until, she said, his fingers were inside her. She was 12.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize what he was doing was wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Alvarado said. But she explained that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thought everything could be fixed through the butt.‚<U+0080>ù That is why her gymnastics teammates in Lansing, Mich., called him the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>butt doctor.‚<U+0080>ùThe monthly appointments continued through the summer of 2015 and into the next year. So did her shame, and dread.The same was true for Hannah Morrow, of Naperville, Ill., who will turn 18 on Tuesday. Several times a year, starting when she was 11 or 12, she took the four-hour car ride to see Dr. Nassar, looping around the bottom coast of Lake Michigan. At some point, she started listening to playlists she compiled to help keep her mind off what was about to be done to her.She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d try to get hooked on a new song to sing in her head, over and over. Her favorite, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I Write Sins Not Tragedies‚<U+0080>ù by Panic! At the Disco, included the line: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.‚<U+0080>ùAs with Emma Ann Miller, Hannah also began wearing tighter pants and underwear that covered more of her buttocks, in the unrealized hope that it would dissuade him. She struggled to reconcile his outsize reputation with what he was doing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If all of those Olympians loved him, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing wrong,‚<U+0080>ù Hannah remembered thinking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though I feel weird with what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s doing, I guess I shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d make excuses: He doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too close to my butt, or that he brushed over my boobs.‚<U+0080>ùIn late July or early August, F.B.I. agents asked Ms. Maroney to travel to Indianapolis from her home in California to discuss the allegation, according to her lawyer, John Manly, but she declined. It is unclear why an agent did not travel to see her in person. As a result, the first substantive interview of an alleged victim in a child-molestation case was conducted by telephone.Meanwhile, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman continued their gymnastics pursuits ‚<U+0080><U+0094> both competed at the P & G Championships in Indianapolis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but they still had received no word from any law enforcement official about the allegations now lodged with the F.B.I.Some of the delay appears to have been related to questions concerning federal-versus-state jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction within the F.B.I. itself. Although the Indianapolis bureau had received the information, the alleged sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar had taken place in Texas, at the Karolyi ranch, and in Michigan, where he lived and worked. And Ms. Maroney lived in California.According to Mr. Abbott, his agents in Indianapolis did not have the case for long. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we consulted with the U.S. attorney, we knew right away that we would not have venue,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was never really our case.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Abbott said that his agents conducted some interviews, but he declined to say with whom. He also said written reports were sent within weeks to F.B.I. offices in Michigan and Los Angeles.The retired agent emphasized how the sensitivities and difficulties of child-exploitation cases can contribute to the length of investigations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are dealing with victims who sometimes don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be interviewed,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is extremely delicate. And you also have the parents of minors who are sometimes not comfortable with interviews.‚<U+0080>ùAsked why federal law enforcement officials did not notify people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> other gymnasts, parents, coaches ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that a potential child molester was in their midst, Mr. Abbott said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s where things can get tricky.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a duty to warn those who might be harmed in the future,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But everyone is still trying to ascertain whether a crime has been committed. And everybody has rights here‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reference to both the alleged victims and the person being accused.The Nassar case might have been further complicated, he said, by the fact that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there was a vigorous debate going on about whether this was a legitimate medical procedure.‚<U+0080>ùU.S.A. Gymnastics officials said that around this time they were told that pertinent interviews had been completed and that the case had been transferred to another jurisdiction. Indeed, on Sept. 12, Ms. Maroney was directed by U.S.A. Gymnastics to contact the F.B.I. East Lansing office.According to Mr. Manly, the retired gymnast‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Erin Maroney, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>called repeatedly,‚<U+0080>ù but received no follow-up response.Two weeks later, on Sept. 27, Dr. Nassar announced on Facebook that he was retiring from the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team staff, notwithstanding a note he had posted in late June saying he would remain with the team through the summer of 2016.He did not elaborate.In April 2016, Ms. Raisman shared a gold medal with the national team at the Pacific Rim Championships in Seattle, while Ms. Nichols damaged a knee during training, underwent surgery, and was out for several weeks ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reminder of the physical toll of the sport. Meanwhile, neither she nor her parents heard anything about the federal investigation that U.S.A. Gymnastics had instructed them to remain silent about.The Raisman family was similarly frustrated. According to a person close to the family, Ms. Raisman and her mother, Lynn, repeatedly reached out to Mr. Penny to find out about the status of the federal investigation, only to be told that an F.B.I. agent would be getting in touch with them.Finally, the absence of information about the federal investigation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the increasing concern of the victims and their families ‚<U+0080><U+0094> prompted Mr. Penny and Mr. Parilla, the U.S.A. Gymnastics officials, to visit the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Los Angeles bureau in early May. Mr. Parilla lives in Southern California, as does Ms. Maroney, and Mr. Penny stopped in Los Angeles while returning from an overseas trip.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As time passed, concern about a perceived lack of development prompted Board Chair Paul Parilla and C.E.O. Steve Penny to report the matter a second time to a different F.B.I. office,‚<U+0080>ù U.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement to The Times on Friday.Through a lawyer and a spokeswoman, Mr. Parilla and Mr. Penny declined to be interviewed for this article.The visit appears to have jump-started the federal investigation into Dr. Nassar. Agents asked for more information, including a list of the members of the national women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics team. And on May 17, the F.B.I. finally interviewed Ms. Maroney in person.It had been 294 days since the F.B.I. was first notified of accusations against Dr. Nassar.A few weeks later, on June 13, Gina Nichols received an email from Michael Hess, an F.B.I. agent then based in Los Angeles. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am looking into a complaint that was filed involving alleged misconduct by an individual associated with U.S.A. Gymnastics,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When you have a moment, please give me a call at the below numbers.‚<U+0080>ùIt was a stressful time: Her daughter was preparing for the Olympic trials. But several days later, the gymnast went to a suburban Minneapolis building, not far from her home, to meet Mr. Hess, who had flown in from Los Angeles.In addition, a person close to the Raisman family said that the F.B.I. also contacted Ms. Raisman in the summer of 2016. While Mr. Manly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who represents Ms. Raisman, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Maroney ‚<U+0080><U+0094> applauded the diligence of Mr. Hess, he expressed amazement that so little had been done for so long.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given who these women were, all competing for their country, and given that these assaults had occurred in different states and countries, there was an obvious need to have a multilayered, multijurisdictional investigation,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Manly said.Gina Nichols, who had been instructed by U.S.A. Gymnastics not to talk about the matter, recalled that while venting in a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Hess, the agent told her:You can talk to anybody you want.That August, in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Raisman had an Olympics for the ages, demonstrating poise and leadership as she won three medals, including gold. But Ms. Nichols, returning from her knee injury, was ultimately not invited to join the Olympic team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even as an alternate.Meanwhile, Emma Ann Miller continued to keep her treatment appointments with Dr. Nassar. But the abuse had worsened, and she no longer felt like the bubbly teenager she had been only a year before. She stopped taking selfies because she felt ugly and fat. She‚<U+0080><U+0099>d cry if she received an A-minus on a paper or test, thinking it was evidence of her stupidity.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even want to order a drink at Starbucks because I was so scared I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d mess it up,‚<U+0080>ù Emma Ann said.Her mother, Leslie Miller, struggles now with her rage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at what he did to my happy girl,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Miller said, in tears. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look at all the people who could‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve stopped him earlier. My goal is to find every single one of them in the haystack ‚<U+0080><U+0094> expose them all, so this will never happen again.‚<U+0080>ùIt was only a matter of time.On Sept. 12, 2016, The Indianapolis Star published an in-depth investigation detailing allegations that Dr. Nassar had repeatedly molested two gymnasts when they were young. One woman had filed a criminal complaint with the police in Michigan. The other, initially described only as an Olympic medalist, had filed a lawsuit against the doctor and U.S.A. Gymnastics in California. Neither was involved in the F.B.I. inquiry.Suddenly, the Nassar case took on urgency. As other girls and women began calling the Michigan State University Police to file complaints, their numbers eventually growing into the dozens, their abuser did what he could to mask his behavior, including throwing hard drives containing more than 37,000 images and videos of child pornography into the trash for pickup in the morning.But trash pickup in his neighborhood was late that day, allowing a police officer to find the horrifying material while executing a search warrant on behalf of the university police.By the close of 2016, Dr. Nassar was in custody. By the close of 2017, he had been convicted of myriad state charges, as well as federal child pornography charges, based in large part on that state search warrant. Given that he has been sentenced to nearly two centuries in prison, Dr. Nassar will likely die there.In recent weeks, a communal catharsis has played out, as dozens and dozens of empowered victims or their proxies have confronted the doctor at sentencing hearings. The angry but resolute words of Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols have echoed in the courtrooms of Michigan.So, too, have the words of the lesser-known accusers, those girls and young women who report they were abused in the year after allegations were first presented to the F.B.I. in Indianapolis: the likes of Alexis Alvarado and Hannah Morrow ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and Emma Ann Miller, who in November turned 15.The American gymnast McKayla Maroney, an Olympic gold medalist, said she was sexually abused by the same team doctor who is already facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Maroney, 21, posted on Twitter early Wednesday morning that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13.Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven other individuals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on separate criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 125 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, and dozens of civil suits filed against him in Michigan are currently in mediation.In her Twitter post, Maroney said Nassar molested team members, including her, under the guise of treating them for medical conditions over several decades. Her claims matched the stories of other gymnasts and former teammates.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treated,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Maroney said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened in London before my team and I won the gold medal, and it happened before I won my silver.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old. I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>treatment.‚<U+0080><U+0099> I thought I was going to die that night.‚<U+0080>ùJamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the gymnasts who have accused Nassar. Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward, and many have joined a lawsuit against USA Gymnastics.Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, declined a request to comment on Wednesday.Maroney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusation comes a day after another gold medalist, Tatiana Gutsu of Ukraine, accused a star gymnast of raping her when she was 15. Gutsu won the all-around title at the 1992 Barcelona Games as part of the Unified Team of former Soviet athletes.Maroney said she chose to speak out publicly because of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Me Too‚<U+0080>ù movement in which women post the phrase on social media to show that they, too, have been sexually assaulted or harassed.Maroney was part of the 2012 American gymnastics team that won a team gold medal. She also won an individual silver on her specialty, the vault.She drew extra attention that year for a look of disappointment she displayed on the medal stand after winning her silver. The picture became an internet meme, often labeled, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>McKayla is not impressed,‚<U+0080>ù and President Barack Obama and others emulated her expression.The American gymnast Aly Raisman said that she too had been sexually abused by the team doctor who is facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts.Ms. Raisman, 23, made the revelation in an interview with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes,‚<U+0080>ù excerpts from which were released Friday, and in a book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fierce,‚<U+0080>ù being released next week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am angry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m really upset because I care a lot, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman was captain of the teams that won gold medals for the United States at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics. Another member of the 2012 team, McKayla Maroney, said last month that the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, began molesting her at age 13. Jamie Dantzscher, a 2000 Olympian, is among the other gymnasts who have accused Dr. Nassar.Dr. Nassar is in jail in Michigan, facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This guy is a monster,‚<U+0080>ù Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said in February.Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography, is awaiting trial on criminal sexual conduct charges, and he has been sued by more than 100 women accusing him of sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty to the assault charges.Although the charges relate to seven gymnasts, lawyers say dozens of other accusers have come forward.Dr. Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past. A lawyer who has represented him, Matt Newburg, said Friday that he did not have a comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why are we looking at why didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the girls speak up?‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman told ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes.‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why not look at, what about the culture? What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement, USA Gymnastics said it had adopted a new policy that requires the reporting of suspicions of sexual abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are appalled by the conduct of which Larry Nassar is accused, and we are very sorry that any athlete has been harmed during his or her gymnastics career.‚<U+0080>ùThe interview will air in full on Sunday on CBS.In addition to her team gold medals, Ms. Raisman won the 2012 gold medal in floor exercise, as well as two individual silver medals and one bronze in her Olympics career. She also won four world championships medals and numerous national titles.Though she was the oldest gymnast on both the 2012 and 2016 teams, she has spoken of continuing her career and going for the 2020 Games.Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, a former team doctor for U.S.A. Gymnastics who has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing gymnasts under the guise of medical treatment, was sentenced on Thursday to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.The charges, which stemmed from more than 37,000 images of child pornography found on Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer, are separate from the 10 molestation counts on which sentences will be handed down in January. He pleaded guilty to the pornography charges over the summer, and to the molestation charges in November.Dr. Nassar, 54, is expected to be sentenced to 25 years or more on the molestation charges. But even without that, he is virtually certain to spend the rest of his life in prison after Janet T. Neff, a federal district judge in Grand Rapids, Mich., imposed three consecutive 20-year sentences in the child pornography case.Matthew Newburg, a lawyer for Dr. Nassar, declined to comment on Thursday.The case against Dr. Nassar emerged last year, after an Indianapolis Star investigation found that U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national governing body, had systematically failed to report gymnasts‚<U+0080><U+0099> allegations of sexual abuse by coaches. Then, in September 2016, The Star published detailed accounts from two former gymnasts who said that, among other sexually abusive behavior, Dr. Nassar had penetrated them with his fingers, claiming it was a treatment for back pain.Those two gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Rachael Denhollander, who was the first to step forward by name, and Jamie Dantzscher, who initially remained anonymous but later spoke out publicly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> broke a dam of silence in the sport, more than a year before the #MeToo movement began revealing sexual misconduct by innumerable men in powerful positions. More than 130 women ‚<U+0080><U+0094> mostly but not exclusively gymnasts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have now described abuse by Dr. Nassar (who worked both for the national team and for Michigan State University). Among them are at least seven former members of the United States national gymnastics team, including four Olympians.Many of the women submitted victim impact statements to the court before the sentencing on Thursday. Judge Neff ruled last week that they could not be read aloud in the courtroom, but some women shared their statements through other channels.McKayla Maroney, a 2012 Olympian who came forward in October as one of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims, wrote in her statement that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He abused my trust, abused my body and left scars on my psyche that may never heal,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Maroney wrote, according to ESPN.And Aly Raisman ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the captain of the American women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gymnastics teams at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and one of the most outspoken survivors of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> published thousands of words in The Players‚<U+0080><U+0099> Tribune on Thursday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I ask that you give Larry the strongest possible sentence (which his actions deserve), for by doing so, you will send a message to him and to other abusers that they cannot get away with their horrible crimes,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman, 23, said in her statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maybe knowing that Larry is being held accountable for his abuse will help me and the other survivors feel less alone, like we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re being heard, and open up pathways for healing.‚<U+0080>ùBecause of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, Ms. Raisman wrote, she is frequently afraid: afraid that other doctors will treat her similarly; afraid even that a man will deliver her room service order when she travels.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hold the door open as he drops off the food and keep it open until he leaves,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I often wonder if I am hurting their feelings by being so obviously distrusting of them. I always used to give people the benefit of the doubt, but if a decorated doctor who served on the national team for over 30 years turned out to be a monster, then how can I trust anybody?‚<U+0080>ùEven so, she continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am not a victim. I am a survivor. The abuse does not define me, or anyone else who has been abused.‚<U+0080>ùBeyond Dr. Nassar himself, the cases have ensnared U.S.A. Gymnastics and many of its top officials, whom lawsuits have accused of turning a blind eye and of fostering toxic environments in which abuse could flourish. Earlier this year, U.S.A. Gymnastics adopted stricter reporting policies in response to an extensive report on its previous failings.Some gymnasts said it was difficult to feel entirely victorious after the sentencing, because Dr. Nassar was part of a much larger problem.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, the justice feels very incomplete,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said at a news conference on Thursday.NASHVILLE, Tenn. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A longtime pastor has been returned to Tennessee to face charges that he molested several children during his time leading a Nashville congregation.Media reports say Matthew Dennis Patterson was arrested March 8 by Nashville police in Pennsylvania, where he moved after leaving the Tennessee church last September.Patterson was extradited to Nashville on Friday.He served as pastor of Nolensville Road Baptist Church. After his resignation, authorities say church members went to police with complaints about his requests to ""engage in strange activities"" with children.According to a police statement, children told adult church members that Patterson had asked them to sit on his face and stomach, sometimes in their underwear.Patterson has been indicted on eight counts of aggravated sexual battery. Police say each count is linked to a different child.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a child sex abuse scandal that has rocked English soccer, a former youth coach and talent scout who worked for a number of well-known teams was convicted on Tuesday of 36 counts of sexually assaulting boys aged 8 to 15, from 1979 to 1990.The case against the former coach, Barry Bennell, began in late 2016, when Andrew Woodward became the first professional player to say publicly that he had been molested by a coach, accusing Mr. Bennell. But the scandal widened, as other allegations were made against Mr. Bennell, and then against other well-known coaches and scouts, until those stepping forward to say they had been victimized numbered in the hundreds, including dozens of former professionals.Soccer has taken its place among the institutions tarnished by the disclosure of systematic sexual exploitation, including the Roman Catholic Church, the news media and Hollywood. In Britain, the case of Mr. Bennell came after revelations that Jimmy Savile, a longtime host of BBC television shows who died in 2011, had molested dozens of children.From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Mr. Bennell, now 64, worked for several well-known professional teams ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including one, Manchester City, that plays in the upper echelon of the game ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as a scout and sometime coach for youth programs. The work gave him access to boys who lived away from their parents at times.Prosecutors said that he equipped his home with video games, exotic animals and fast food to make it attractive to boys, and that he abused them there and in his car.Twice in the 1990s and again in 2015, Mr. Bennell ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has changed his name to Richard Jones ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was convicted of multiple counts of sexually abusing youth players and sent to prison. The latest revelations were surprising less in that additional long-ago victims might be found than in the numbers and prominence of some of them.The jury in Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday found him not guilty of three charges, and they will continue deliberating on seven others.CHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Federal prosecutors on Friday for the first time provided details of sexual abuse allegations against J. Dennis Hastert, the former speaker of the House, asserting that he molested at least four boys, as young as 14, when he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades ago.Mr. Hastert, 74, is not charged with abuse because of statutes of limitation, prosecutors said, but he was accused last year of illegally structuring bank withdrawals to pay one of his victims in an effort to hide the abuse. He pleaded guilty in October to the banking violation, and suffered a stroke in November while awaiting sentencing, set for April 27.In a court filing late Friday, making suggestions for a judge who will decide Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentence, the prosecutors described specific, graphic incidents that they say occurred when Mr. Hastert was a popular, championship-winning coach in a small Illinois town in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. The ‚<U+0080><U+009C>known acts,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said, consisted of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>intentional touching of minors‚<U+0080><U+0099> groin area and genitals or oral sex with a minor.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The actions at the core of this case took place not on the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national public stage but in his private one-on-one encounters in an empty locker room and a motel room with minors that violated the special trust between those young boys and their coach,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors wrote.A lawyer for Mr. Hastert did not reply to a request for comment on the prosecution claims. In a court filing earlier this week, Mr. Hastert, who has stayed largely out of view since the charges emerged nearly a year ago, requested probation and said he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>profoundly sorry‚<U+0080>ù for past conduct, though he did not specify those actions. On Friday, Mr. Hastert also filed under a seal a response to the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pre-sentence investigation. A hearing is set for next week on whether his filing remains under seal.According to the prosecutors, Mr. Hastert gave one boy, a 14-year-old freshman wrestler, a massage in the locker room, then performed an unspecified sex act on him. Another boy, Stephen Reinboldt, who died in 1995, was sexually abused by Mr. Hastert throughout high school in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his sister and others told the prosecutors. A third boy, who was 17 and remembered Mr. Hastert sitting in a recliner-type chair with a direct view of the locker room shower stalls, said Mr. Hastert had told him that one way to make his wrestling weight was to get a massage, then performed a sexual act. And prosecutors said Mr. Hastert had massaged another boy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s groin area after asking the boy to stay in his hotel room during a wrestling camp.That incident became the center of the prosecution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. It was also the reason that the allegations, which were never exposed during Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s eight years as the Republican speaker of the House, came to light. The boy, known in court documents as Individual A, confronted Mr. Hastert years later, around 2010, asked him why he had done what he did, and sought a settlement ‚<U+0080><U+0094> beginning the payments that would be Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s downfall.In late 2014, as law enforcement authorities were investigating unusually large withdrawals from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bank account, Mr. Hastert said that he was doing nothing unusual with his money ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and that he simply did not trust banks. Not long after, his lawyer told the investigators a different story: The lawyer said that Mr. Hastert was paying large sums ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and promising as much as $3.5 million, the authorities say ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to Individual A because Individual A was extorting him for false allegations of abuse.After a series of recorded phone calls, with Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation, the investigators concluded that there was no extortion, but that Mr. Hastert was actually carrying out an agreed-to settlement for real abuse.Even when Mr. Hastert told Individual A, as investigators listened in, that he needed more time to come up with more money, Individual A ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did not make any threats‚<U+0080>ù and even ‚<U+0080><U+009C>expressed understanding,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. At another point, Individual A seemed agreeable, even empathetic, suggesting that they settle on smaller amounts and keep the payments as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>private, personal matter.‚<U+0080>ù Individual A even pushed Mr. Hastert to tell his wife about the payment agreement, and suggested that an outside lawyer or confidante might be called in.Of the abuse of Individual A, prosecutors said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no ambiguity.‚<U+0080>ùProsecutors said the motel incident had happened during a trip to a wrestling camp, in which several other boys shared a room but where Individual A and Mr. Hastert spent the night together. Individual A told prosecutors he did not know why Mr. Hastert had singled him out.The court filing says Mr. Hastert had the boy strip naked and lay on a bed under the guise of treating a groin pull, but it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became clear to Individual A that defendant was not touching him in a therapeutic manner to address a wrestling injury but was touching him in an inappropriate sexual way.‚<U+0080>ù The boy then ran across the room, confused and embarrassed, before Mr. Hastert asked him to get onto Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s back and to give the coach a massage. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Defendant lay on the bed in only his underwear, and Individual A gave him a back massage,‚<U+0080>ù the prosecutors said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They then went to sleep in the same bed.‚<U+0080>ùWhen Mr. Hastert was charged last year, the accusations rattled the town of Yorkville, Ill., about an hour west of here. Mr. Hastert, a Republican who served as House speaker from 1999 to 2007, was regarded as a hero by many in Yorkville, where he had taught high school. But prosecutors said Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marred by stunning hypocrisy.‚<U+0080>ùThey alluded to a fifth boy from Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s days in Yorkville who recalled Coach Hastert brushing against his genitals during a massage at one point. But he said he was unsure whether the contact was intentional though he found it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>very weird.‚<U+0080>ùOf the boys, prosecutors said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He made them feel alone, ashamed, guilty and devoid of dignity. While defendant achieved great success, reaping all the benefits that went with it, these boys struggled, and all are still struggling now with what defendant did to them.‚<U+0080>ùIn the court filing, prosecutors said they believed Mr. Hastert should face up to six months in prison, as suggested under federal guidelines.Prosecutors took note of Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor health, but said that Mr. Hastert could continue getting medical care in prison if needed.Steven A. Block, an assistant United States Attorney, said that Mr. Hastert‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sentencing judge should ‚<U+0080><U+009C>balance the positive nature of defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public service with the need to avoid a public perception that the powerful are treated differently than ordinary citizens when facing sentencing for a serious crime.‚<U+0080>ùBEIJING ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Thirty years after Gao Chengyong embarked on a succession of 11 rape-murders of women in northwest China, a court sentenced him to death on Friday, following an investigation that involved sifting through 230,000 fingerprints.The sentence by a court in Baiyin, a small city in Gansu Province, was not unexpected in China, which executes more prisoners than any other. But the verdict against Mr. Gao, 53, a farmer, itinerant worker and shopkeeper, was widely reported, and applauded, in China, where the killings drew intense attention.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The motives for the defendant Gao Chengyong‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crimes were utterly despicable, the means were utterly vicious, the nature of the crimes utterly vile,‚<U+0080>ù the court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s verdict stated, according to the China News Service, an official agency.The court found that Mr. Gao had killed 11 women, whom he usually followed to their homes. He murdered all but one around Baiyin; another woman was killed in Baotou, a city in the north Chinese region of Inner Mongolia. In many cases, he molested the women and dismembered their bodies. Besides homicide, he also was found guilty of rape and of defiling corpses. He stood trial last July.When Mr. Gao was arrested in 2016, the last murder had taken place 14 years earlier, and the police needed advanced forensic technology, as well as an element of chance, to link him to the crimes.Zhang Enwei, a forensic detective who helped solve the murders, said he had checked 230,000 sets of fingerprints trying to identify a suspect, Beijing News, a newspaper, reported on Friday. But Mr. Gao was one of hundreds of millions of rural migrants who move around, often slipping past city data checks, and he was not caught in the dragnet for fingerprints in Baiyin.But by 2011, the detectives in Baiyin had acquired technology to trace DNA clues, and five years later a relative of Mr. Gao had his DNA sample taken after he was suspected of giving kickbacks. Their shared traits led the investigators to Mr. Gao, who was then running a small store in a school in Baiyin with his wife.Mr. Zhang said Mr. Gao was very calm when he was shown the evidence, according to the Beijing News. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Basically he did not offer too much of a defense,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Mr. Zhang said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew that this day would come.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Gao said he would not appeal the sentence. In an interview last year, his defense lawyer, Zhu Aijun, denied reports that Mr. Gao had chosen as his victims only women and girls with long hair and dressed in red.Mr. Gao said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chosen his targets for crimes at random,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Zhu told a Chinese news website. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That was one of the reasons that it was so hard to crack the case for a long time.‚<U+0080>ùSALT LAKE CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Mormon church is changing its guidelines for how local leaders handle sexual abuse reports and one-on-one meetings with youth a week after a former prominent missionary leader was accused of sexually assaulting two women in the 1980s.The changes announced Monday by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints direct lay leaders never to disregard a report of abuse, a more direct instruction than previous guidelines.A key new rule allows children to bring a parent or adult with them during one-one-one interviews with local church leaders known as bishops. Parents were only allowed in a hallway or adjacent room under old rules. Youth can still go in alone if they choose.Critics say the changes still don't go far enough.The guidelines also tell leaders to never encourage a person to stay in a home or situation where abuse is suspected, guidance not in there before. An introduction to the guidelines says most, but not all, ""allegations of abuse made by assault victims are true, and should be taken seriously and handled with great care.""The meetings with children usually happen twice a year starting at age 12. Bishops ask about topics such as school, sports, hobbies, education goals and family issues. The questions sometimes delve into sexual behavior because of the church's strict teachings on abstinence before marriage.Last year, a group of Mormons and ex-Mormons demanded an end to the one-on-one interviews and a prohibition on all sexual questions.Sam Young, a Mormon father from Houston who is leading the campaign, said Tuesday the changes don't go far enough. He said a parent or adult should be required for all meetings. He said sexual questions often become explicit and argues children should only be asked if they are obeying the faith's law of chastity.The group plans a protest march Friday in Salt Lake City and expects to deliver 50,000 signatures to church headquarters.""Our march is even more important than it's ever been because we know the church is listening,"" said Young, 65, a former bishop and missionary. ""I care about the church. This is my church. What are we're doing harming these children gives my church a horrid name.""Mormon church spokesman Eric Hawkins on Tuesday pointed to previous comments that the interviews allow bishops to get to know youth better and determine their religious habits and obedience to God. The bishops are instructed how to handle the meetings and swear to keep the conversations confidential, he said.""They are counseled to not be unnecessarily probing or invasive in their questions, but should allow a young person to share their experiences, struggles and feelings,"" Hawkins said.Former Mormon Amy Hall, 56, compared the changes to ""putting a Band-Aid on open surgery.""She said she was molested around the age of 12 by a bishop in Bakersfield, California, causing her a lifetime of shame and leading her to leave the faith in her 20s. The Associated Press doesn't normally name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Hall agreed to share her story to support Young's campaign and said she hopes other Mormon children don't have to endure similar abuse.She never reported her abuse and only recently confronted how it impacted her life, adding she is in therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Asking children about sexual things is perverted,"" Hall said.A letter sent by new Mormon president Russell M. Nelson to local and regional leaders in the U.S. and Canada announced the changes. ""This global issue continues to be of great concern to us today,"" Nelson wrote.The changes come as the church investigates two allegations of sexual abuse against a former missionary leader in the 1980s. Joseph L. Bishop has denied the allegations through his adult son but he acknowledged in a police interview that he asked one of the women to expose her breasts at a time when he was president of the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.Bishop is also heard apologizing on a secretly recorded conversation made by one of the victims. He is heard saying he molested the second woman during a massage that he said got ""too frisky.""The church said it knew previously about both claims, but declined to discipline Bishop because the allegations couldn't be verified.This past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Denver ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The radio host whom Taylor Swift has accused of groping her testified Tuesday that her version of what occurred is false and that her account, embraced and acted upon by his employers, ruined his life.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cost me my career, the thing I love to do, my passion,‚<U+0080>ù the host, David Mueller, who was known on air as Jackson, said. He was the first witness to testify in the trial that grew from the civil case he filed in 2015 against Ms. Swift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been hard on my friends,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has an impact on my girlfriend. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable.‚<U+0080>ùIn court documents, Ms. Swift says Mr. Mueller put his hand up her dress and grabbed her bottom as he posed for a photograph with her before a June 2, 2013, concert in Denver. Mr. Mueller contends Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account led the Denver radio station KYGO to fire him and he later sued the entertainer, her mother and one of her managers. Ms. Swift then countersued, accusing Mr. Mueller of assault and battery.Eight jurors ‚<U+0080><U+0094> six women and two men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will decide the two suits and they listened Tuesday in United States District Court here as both sides outlined their cases.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, hammered at Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility during cross-examination, raising, for example, the disappearance of recordings that Mr. Mueller had secretly made of conversations with his bosses about Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations. And while Mr. Mueller said he had filed suit to clear his name, not to win a specific amount in damages, he acknowledged to Mr. Baldridge that he had hired an expert who determined the termination had cost him nearly $3 million.Mr. Mueller also acknowledged a strained relationship with his superiors at KYGO before the encounter with Ms. Swift and he noted that his suit targets only Ms. Swift and her associates, not the station or its executives.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He wants you to give him the payday,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Baldridge told the jurors. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is trying to make the victim pay the price.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift, who also is scheduled to testify, sat with her lawyers and looked at Mr. Mueller occasionally during his testimony. At times she appeared to be taking notes which she shared with her mother. It is unclear when Ms. Swift will take the stand.Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice was shaky at the start of his testimony under questioning by his lawyer but grew steadier. Pressed hard for answers during the cross-examination, his voice occasionally rose in pitch and several times he looked toward the judge, as if for support, when questions came in a barrage.His lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, said in his opening statement that his client, who was with his girlfriend during the photo shoot, had no reason to jeopardize a lucrative job and a budding relationship by groping Ms. Swift.Mr. Mueller repeatedly denied groping Ms. Swift. He said that he reached out with his right arm and a closed hand and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>felt what seemed to be a rib cage‚<U+0080>ù with his knuckles as he rushed to get into position for the photograph. In that image, which was shown to jurors Tuesday, Ms. Swift is standing at a slight distance from Mr. Mueller, whose right arm is extended behind her back and toward her bottom. His hand is not visible and is it not possible to see whether the back of her skirt has been moved.Under questioning from Mr. Baldridge, Mr. Mueller said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible‚<U+0080>ù his hand came into contact with Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bottom, and if so she had a right to tell KYGO officials.Mr. Mueller also testified about a conversation he said he had with his boss, Hershel Coomer, known professionally as Eddie Haskell. He said Mr. Coomer, a longtime acquaintance of Ms. Swift, told him that he had greeted her at the Pepsi Center by putting his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hand on her butt.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mueller described Mr. Coomer going on to speculate that the singer wore bicycle shorts under her stage outfits. Mr. Mueller said he did not give that account to imply Mr. Coomer had groped Ms. Swift.Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer said Mr. Coomer would testify that he never said the things Mr. Mueller has attributed to him.Mr. Baldridge described Ms. Swift as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taking a stand through this case for all women, including my daughter.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fans rose early for a chance to see her in court and filled a quarter of the courtroom. The presiding judge, William J. Mart√≠nez, set aside 32 seats for the public in the courtroom and 75 in an overflow room with a closed circuit video feed of the proceedings.Lucy Peterson, 17, arrived at the downtown Denver courthouse just after 4 a.m. Tuesday with two friends from her Denver high school to seize the first places in a line that had grown to two dozen by 8 a.m. Ms. Peterson said she believed many of Ms. Swift‚<U+0080><U+0099>s admirers had experienced sexual harassment and looked up to the star for speaking out about something that others might be embarrassed or afraid to address.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shedding light on the issue and I hope bringing more attention to it,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Peterson said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her experiences,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not different from ours.‚<U+0080>ùNEW YORK ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Summer Zervos, a California restaurant owner who appeared as a contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" isn't asking for much in her defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump. She wants less than $3,000 and an apology for what she said were unwanted sexual advances.But if the lawsuit continues, it could land Trump in the same cycle of depositions and document discovery that caused so much trouble for President Bill Clinton after he was sued by Paula Jones.That would mean he would have to answer potentially embarrassing questions under oath about his relationships with women.Trump's attempts to get the lawsuit tossed out have failed so far, but the battle isn't over yet.Here's a look at the case and where it could go from here:WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT?Near the end of the presidential race, Zervos and more than a dozen other women came forward to say Trump had sexually harassed or assaulted them.Zervos, who appeared on ""The Apprentice"" in 2006, said that when she returned months later to inquire about a job, Trump groped and forcibly kissed her.Trump said Zervos and his other accusers made up phony stories to get attention.""Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election,"" Trump tweeted.Zervos isn't suing Trump for sexual harassment. The statute of limitations for that kind of lawsuit passed years ago. She's suing Trump for calling her a liar, saying it harmed her reputation.In the suit, Zervos has asked for an apology, a retraction of Trump's denials, and at least $2,914 in compensation, though damages could ultimately be higher if a jury finds the president defamed her.WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE TO PROVE TO WIN?Zervos has to prove Trump lied about her to other people and that those lies caused real harm. Legal experts say that means she must show that Trump really did kiss and grope her against her will.Proving that took place won't be easy since the encounter allegedly took place in 2007 in Trump's room at the Beverly Hills Hotel. But in trying to build a case, Zervos' lawyers can request documents, videos, and emails in which Trump, his employees or aides might have discussed the incident.They can also request that the president be questioned under oath, in which case he would be obligated to answer questions truthfully.""The nature of that relationship, his behavior and his conduct ... that's all on the table,"" said Alexander A. Reinert, a law professor and director of the Center for Rights and Justice at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.CAN TRUMP GET THE CASE THROWN OUT?He's trying. A New York judge on March 21 shot down an initial attempt to get the case dismissed.Trump's attorneys have said they will appeal. They say the case should at least be delayed until Trump is out of office.They may face an uphill fight. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1997, in the sexual harassment case filed by Paula Jones against then-President Bill Clinton, that presidents are not immune from civil litigation while in office.That ruling forced Clinton to answer questions under oath for nearly six hours in 1998.But Trump's lawyers might have luck delaying the case through appeals and legal maneuvers. Jones' lawsuit against Clinton was tied up in court for four years before he was finally forced to testify ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after he had been re-elected.WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A DEPOSITION?For Clinton, the Jones deposition was a disaster. Faced with embarrassing questions about adultery, he denied having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.That denial was investigated by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who questioned Clinton before a federal grand jury. Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice by the U.S. House of Representatives, but was ultimately acquitted by the U.S. Senate.Zervos' attorney, Mariann Wang, now says she wants to get Trump to give a deposition, where she would get a chance to ask the same sorts of uncomfortable questions.A lawyer for Stormy Daniels also wants to depose Trump in a legal dispute involving a $130,000 payment paid to the porn actress in exchange for her silence about a consensual extramarital affair.""The president has the ability to avoid a crisis by, one, not being deposed, or, two, telling the truth,"" said attorney Joseph Cammarata, who represented Jones in her lawsuit. ""It poses a peril if you don't tell truth. Even if you're the one running the country.""Even if Trump is truthful, there could still be political fallout.""I think people are revisiting their thoughts on the subject of what's right and what's wrong with respect to claims of sexual assault,"" Cammarata said.Wang said in court that she could work around Trump's busy schedule and would agree to videotaped depositions.""We can take a deposition down to Mar-a-Lago in between him going to play golf,"" she said, a jab at Trump's frequent visits to his Florida resort.SYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has spent most of his career advocating for rural voters and strong families, and shouting down welfare cheats.But on Wednesday in Parliament, he offered a full-throated defense for remaining in office despite an affair with a former staff member who is now pregnant, and with whom he lived rent-free in an apartment owned by a wealthy supporter.Such is the scandal known as #barnababy, which in just one week has gone from a debate about privacy, sex and tabloids to an indictment of Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crony politics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This whole incident is absolutely tailor-made to undercut people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faith in the Parliament, which is already at an all-time low,‚<U+0080>ù said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in Queensland.The longer Mr. Joyce stays in office, she added, the more resentment about politics grows. All of Canberra, Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s capital, seems to be on trial now, with its cozy, clubby ways looking increasingly inappropriate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is not a healthy place,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It runs on alcohol and gossip and fumes and power.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Joyce, a gregarious bull of a man often seen in a trademark Akubra bush hat, now faces a series of uncomfortable questions:‚<U+0080>¢ Were public funds used to cultivate an extramarital affair?‚<U+0080>¢ How did he and his new partner, Vikki Campion, a former journalist, end up in a supporter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s free apartment?‚<U+0080>¢ How did Ms. Campion  secure a high-paying job with a Parliament colleague?‚<U+0080>¢ And, did Mr. Joyce grope a woman after an awards ceremony in 2011?Mr. Joyce, 50, has denied groping and other ministerial misconduct. He has spent much of the week offering defiance and remorse, and trying to hold on to his job.He acknowledged his relationship with Ms. Campion on Tuesday, apologizing to his family, his constituents and the National Party of Australia, which he still leads.But he also told his party colleagues he would not step down. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Every political career has a time of trial,‚<U+0080>ù he said.His stand fits with his longstanding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>just a bloke‚<U+0080>ù appeal. He grew up on a farm in Tamworth, in Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s southeast, which is home of the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s largest country music festival. Mr. Joyce is known as an off-the-cuff maverick who is loyal less to ideology than to his constituents.But since 2004, he has been a Canberra man. He was a senator for Queensland and then joined the House of Representatives in 2013. He became leader of the National Party and deputy prime minister in 2016.Mr. Joyce is no stranger to scandal. A few years ago he made headlines worldwide when he threatened to euthanize two dogs belonging to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard after the celebrity couple brought them to Australia without the proper documentation and quarantine.Last year, Mr. Joyce was one of several politicians revealed as holding dual citizenship.After the High Court ruled that he had been ineligible to run for Parliament because of it, Mr. Joyce renounced his New Zealand citizenship and returned to his district to campaign again for his seat. He won comfortably.But experts say the backlash has only been intensified by his supposed authenticity, his eagerness to parade his wife and four children in political campaigns, and his brash conservative positions, like his opposition to same-sex marriage, which he argued would destroy families.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The public expected a Barnaby that was a solid country family man, and we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re seeing that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not that at all,‚<U+0080>ù said Jill Sheppard, a lecturer in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there was a political trait Australians hate, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hypocrisy,‚<U+0080>ù Professor Rimmer said.But the biggest threat to Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s career may involve questions about the mingling of adultery, money and power.Records show he claimed a travel allowance for 50 nights in Canberra last year when Parliament was not in session, far more than other senior leaders.Government watchdogs and journalists have also zeroed in on two high-paying positions that were allegedly created for Ms. Campion in the offices of a party colleague, Senator Matt Canavan.Mr. Joyce and Prime Minister Turnbull ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has continued to back him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> said the jobs were beyond reproach because Ms. Campion was not technically his partner at the time.Mr. Joyce‚<U+0080><U+0099>s critics contest that assertion.Officially, for now, Mr. Joyce still has the support of his party. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Barnaby Joyce is the best deliverer for rural and regional Australians in generations,‚<U+0080>ù  Bridget McKenzie, the Nationals deputy, told reporters on Wednesday.But time is not on his side. Mr. Turnbull is scheduled for an overseas trip that includes meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23, which would make Mr. Joyce the acting prime minister.A broader reckoning on the capital‚<U+0080><U+0099>s workplace culture may also be coming.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the Australian public feels the political class is isolated and don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t appreciate their concerns, then that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a problem the political class has to respond to,‚<U+0080>ù said Andrew Giles, a Labor Party politician.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not meeting people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expectations,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re legitimate expectations.‚<U+0080>ùIf ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù suffered any loss of visibility during its monthlong Winter Olympics hiatus, the show got a most unusual promotional boost on Friday. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when President Trump, a frequent target of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù and a once-vocal critic of the show, broke a monthslong silence and went on Twitter to vent his spleen at Alec Baldwin, his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù impersonator.A complete rundown of the Trump-Baldwin spat can be found here, but to quickly summarize, Baldwin in an interview on Thursday said that every time he plays the president now, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like agony,‚<U+0080>ù adding that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we have to get rid of him.‚<U+0080>ù In response, Trump tweeted that Baldwin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me‚<U+0080>ù and that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>agony for those who were forced to watch.‚<U+0080>ù Baldwin then followed with a series of tweets in which he mused, among other things, that he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to stick around in the role long enough ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride‚<U+0080>ù to Mar-a-Lago.This weekend‚<U+0080><U+0099>s broadcast of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.,‚<U+0080>ù hosted by Charles Barkley and featuring the musical guest Migos, didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t directly acknowledge the feud, though it did give Baldwin plenty of airtime to lampoon the president in its opening sketch.In what purported to be another presidential listening session on gun control, Baldwin (as Trump) led off by addressing the audience: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tonight I am here to bring you a message of healing and a show of unity,‚<U+0080>ù he said as he looked at his notes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hear you and I care. Rent ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Lego Ninjago Movie.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Sorry, Eric scribbled some notes on there, too.‚<U+0080>ùAfter contemplating the idea of taking guns away from all Americans ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even whites‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+0094> Baldwin went on to address the latest personnel losses in the Trump administration. Paying homage to Hope Hicks, the outgoing White House communications director, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like a daughter to me. So smart, so hot. You know, I hate seeing her go but I love watching her walk away.‚<U+0080>ùIn her absence, Baldwin said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jared Kushner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basically the hottest chick left in the place.‚<U+0080>ù And when he sought assurance from Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that he was still on board, the camera cut to an empty chair with McMaster‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name in front of it.Turning to the subject of tariffs, Baldwin said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Both sides hated it. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I said I was going to run this country like a business. That business is a Waffle House at 2 a.m. Crazies everywhere, staff walking out in the middle of their shift, managers taking money out of the cash register to pay off the Russian mob.‚<U+0080>ùIn other highlights from the episode:Though he occasionally stumbled in his delivery, Barkley, the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Inside the NBA‚<U+0080>ù analyst, scored with a pointed comedic commentary on the role of athletes in American civic life. He began:Alluding to the Fox News host Laura Ingraham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recent criticism of LeBron James, Barkley added:At the conclusion of his monologue, Barkley traded riffs with the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Michael Che. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud to stand for the anthem,‚<U+0080>ù Barkley said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unless Fergie is singing it, and I just fall over laughing.‚<U+0080>ùChe responded: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I stay seated for the anthem, because I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m still in my Uber. Because black people are always late.‚<U+0080>ùOn the night before the Oscars, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù imagined a far more scathing (if timely) event called the Grabbies, presented by the Academy of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Hollywood and dedicated, as an announcer described, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>celebrating this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worst behavior in entertainment.‚<U+0080>ù Its categories include Handsiest Actor, Best Animated Grope, Worst Thing Done to a Plant and the coveted Cecil B. Molestin‚<U+0080><U+0099> Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as Most Open Robe. Previewing his possible awards speech, an actor played by Pete Davidson said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, first, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like to thank guns for pivoting the national conversation away from harassment. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d also like to thank my uncle for always saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Boys will be boys.‚<U+0080><U+0099> Even when it was, like, O.J.‚<U+0080>ùPlaying the soon-to-be departed Hope Hicks, Cecily Strong recalled her time at the Trump White House as if it were summer camp. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You make all these new friends,‚<U+0080>ù she explained. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You barely get any sleep and then everybody leaves after eight weeks.‚<U+0080>ù She bid farewell to friends like Kellyanne Conway (‚<U+0080><U+009C>You taught me that a strong woman can run a campaign and win. And you showed me what I could turn into if I stick around too long‚<U+0080>ù), and in a final message to her colleagues, she said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll see you guys at the reunion in 10 years. Seven with good behavior.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>S.N.L.‚<U+0080>ù cast member Leslie Jones, who provided running commentary on the Winter Olympics both in person and over Twitter, spoke to the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Weekend Update‚<U+0080>ù co-anchor Colin Jost about her time in Pyeongchang. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a six-foot black woman,‚<U+0080>ù Jones told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You think I stand out in America? Everybody in Korea was 4-foot-1. They either thought I was an athlete or a guy. Some of them thought I was a Transformer, but Transformers don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t eat Korean barbecue like that.‚<U+0080>ùAt the end of her segment, Jones brought out Hilary Knight, a member of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> gold-medal winning women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hockey team, and gave Jost a warning. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be talking about how you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to teach me something,‚<U+0080>ù Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got friends who are gold-medal Olympians.‚<U+0080>ùTo understand what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s at stake in the battle between Apple and the F.B.I. over cracking open a terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphone, it helps to be able to predict the future of the tech industry.For that, here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one bet you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never lose money on: Digital technology always grows hungrier for more personal information, and we users nearly always accede to its demands. Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s smartphones hold a lot of personal data ‚<U+0080><U+0094> your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow‚<U+0080><U+0099>s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.Consider all the technologies we think we want ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.This gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.But if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no longer any room for keeping secrets?‚<U+0080><U+009C>This case can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be a one-time deal,‚<U+0080>ù said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is about the future.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards is the author of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intellectual Privacy,‚<U+0080>ù a book that examines the dangers of a society in which technology and law conspire to eliminate the possibility of thinking without fear of surveillance. He argues that intellectual creativity depends on a baseline measure of privacy, and that privacy is being eroded by cameras, microphones and sensors we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re all voluntarily surrounding ourselves with.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>deviant‚<U+0080><U+0099> ideas ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The particular legal issue is actually quite narrow,‚<U+0080>ù James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., wrote in a blog post on Sunday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s it.‚<U+0080>ùBut civil liberties activists say they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d have an easier time believing Mr. Comey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s assurances if there weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a long history of the government relying on legal cases based on old technology to decide how to handle newer technologies. Courts in the 1960s and 1970s created rules for the wiretapping of analog phone calls; those rulings were later applied as the basis for mass surveillance of the Internet.‚<U+0080><U+009C>By and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before email, before search engines, before social networks,‚<U+0080>ù said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Soghoian pointed out the government had already tried to turn connected devices into surveillance machines. In a mob case more than a decade ago, the F.B.I. asked a company that made an in-dash roadside assistance device ‚<U+0080><U+0094> something like OnStar, which uses a cellular phone to connect to an operator in case of an emergency ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to secretly record the private conversations of people inside a car. A court ruled against the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s request, but only on the very narrow grounds that bugging the car would have interfered with the proper functioning of the in-dash device.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Soghoian said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Soghoian was referring to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s handy digital assistant, a device that is constantly listening to your household conversations to try to offer you friendly help. The Echo listens for a keyword ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alexa!‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prompts it to start streaming your voice to Amazon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s servers to decipher your request. Amazon, which declined to comment on how the Apple case might affect Echo users‚<U+0080><U+0099> privacy, has said it is not constantly recording people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voices, and that it keeps voice recordings only to help the system learn to better understand you.But the Apple case threatens to undermine those promises. If a court can get Apple to hack into an iPhone, why couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t it also force Amazon to change the Echo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s security model so the Echo can record everything you say? Mr. Soghoian believes the Apple case could set that precedent.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Some readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t buy the Amazon Echo. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t put cameras in your house. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re home and when you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not.There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.The Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From a historical perspective, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re entering into a very new era,‚<U+0080>ù said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.‚<U+0080>ùBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Now we have a surveillance-enabled world,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Granick said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cheap, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy. The question that society has to ask is, Is that what we really want?‚<U+0080>ùAn Alaska Airlines pilot has sued the airline, alleging she was drugged and raped by another pilot during a layover last year.The lawsuit by Betty Pina, 39, was filed in King County Superior Court in Washington State on Wednesday, 20 days after it was presented to the airline on Feb. 13. A copy of the complaint was provided by her lawyer, Eric John Makus.It claims that Ms. Pina, an Army veteran who flew helicopter missions in Afghanistan, was the co-pilot on a June flight with the captain from Anchorage to Seattle to Minneapolis, where the two had a scheduled layover.According to the complaint, the pilot asked Ms. Pina to join him for pizza and drinks in the hotel bar where flight crews spend time. Once there, Ms. Pina said she had one glass of wine, and then he brought her a second. Sitting on a stool, she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hard time keeping her head up‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>things appeared to be closing in,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint says.It claims that he proceeded to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>drug Ms. Pina and rape her during a state of involuntary intoxication.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawsuit was reported this week by The Seattle Times and other local news outlets.In an interview late on Thursday, Ms. Pina, reached between flights, repeated many of the details in the lawsuit. It says she blacked out, and when she came to early the next morning, she was in his hotel room bed, naked from the waist down; her underwear was in her purse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew something gravely bad had happened,‚<U+0080>ù she said in the interview.In the lawsuit, she said she was sick and vomited, and when she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>challenged‚<U+0080>ù the pilot, he denied that there had been sexual contact and replied, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You were coming on to me pretty hard.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the lawsuit, a flight attendant told a flight operations officer that she saw the pilot walking down the hall ‚<U+0080><U+009C>with a girl and two glasses of wine,‚<U+0080>ù and that the attendant expressed concern about flying with him.The two were taken off duty for the return to Seattle on June 6, the day after the episode. Ms. Pina said over subsequent weeks, she reported details of what she could remember to the union, an airline human resource official and an investigator referred by the airline. She did not report the episode to the police.She did not fly again until January, she said.Ms. Pina is seeking damages for workplace rape and the airline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unlawfully retaliatory‚<U+0080>ù actions, according to the complaint. It claims that the airline has failed to hold the male pilot accountable and that he poses a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>threat to other employees.‚<U+0080>ùCourts in the United States have previously tackled the issue of sexual harassment of flight crews during layovers, expanding the definition of a work site. In 2001, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Delta Air Lines was potentially liable for not doing enough to stop what a flight attendant said was a rape by another attendant, even though the events occurred when the two were off duty in a hotel room.In a statement, Alaska Airlines said it was taking the matter seriously.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our policy is to withhold an employee from work during this type of investigation,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was immediately removed from flying back in June and remains on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.‚<U+0080>ùThe pilot, who is not named as a defendant, could not be reached on Friday. He has not been charged with a crime.Ms. Pina has been flying for 17 years, including seven years of active duty military service that included flying Chinook helicopters in Afghanistan, for which she was featured in a PBS documentary series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kansas to Kandahar: Citizen Soldiers at War.‚<U+0080>ùShe started working for Alaska Airlines in 2016. She said that after years in the military, she was accustomed to reporting problems only to her superiors. That, she said, might explain why she did not report what happened to the police when she returned to the Seattle area.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought to call the police,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was more worried about my job than my own personal safety.‚<U+0080>ùBut over time, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I knew I failed myself.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Pina said that she pursued the lawsuit because she wanted the company to hold the pilot accountable. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It happened on an overnight with a captain who was abusing his position of authority in an opportunity with me being in a hotel right next to him,‚<U+0080>ù she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It needs to stop from being swept under the rug,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t hate my company. I just hope they step up, and say we have zero tolerance and maybe make any future attackers think twice and not follow through.‚<U+0080>ùIn 1995, Drew Dixon was working her dream job as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, helping to oversee a chart-topping album and a ubiquitous single by Method Man and Mary J. Blige. But as her star rose, Ms. Dixon, then 24, was spiraling into depression, she said, because of prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, Russell Simmons, the rap mogul and co-founder of the label.On work calls, he would talk graphically about how she aroused him. At a staff meeting, he asked her to sit on his lap. He regularly exposed his erect penis to her. Late that year, Mr. Simmons raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment, Ms. Dixon said. She quit Def Jam soon after.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was broken,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In recent interviews, four women spoke on the record about a pattern of violent sexual behavior by Mr. Simmons, disclosing incidents from 1988 to 2014. Three of the women say that he raped them.In each case, numerous friends and associates said they were told of the incidents at the time. The women said they were inspired to come forward in the aftermath of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, as victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> stories have been newly elevated and more often believed.Told in detail about the rape accusations and other misconduct, Mr. Simmons, 60, said in a statement: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have enormous respect for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power.‚<U+0080>ù[Read Russell Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Complete Statement]Last month, Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a forefather of hip-hop who went on to great success in fashion, media and more ‚<U+0080><U+0094> apologized for being ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thoughtless and insensitive‚<U+0080>ù and announced he was stepping down from his companies after the screenwriter Jenny Lumet became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual assault at the time.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have re-dedicated myself to spiritual learning, healing and working on behalf of the communities to which I have devoted my life,‚<U+0080>ù he said in his statement on Wednesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have accepted that I can and should get dirt on my sleeves if it means witnessing the birth of a new consciousness about women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What I will not accept is responsibility for what I have not done. I have conducted my life with a message of peace and love. Although I have been candid about how I have lived in books and interviews detailing my flaws, I will relentlessly fight against any untruthful character assassination that paints me as a man of violence.‚<U+0080>ùThe most powerful men and companies in popular music have thus far gone largely unscathed in the national reckoning over sexual abuse. A major reason: Sex and debauchery are built into the music industry, where the boundaries between work and play blur in late nights at clubs and studios, and many women have scant power or incentive to complain about being mistreated.These women still face powerful industry gatekeepers like Mr. Simmons, whose pedigree and ability to make or break careers allowed his abusive behavior to go unchallenged for decades, his accusers contend. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Russell was like the king of hip-hop,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.She said she was later harassed by another boss, L.A. Reid, the music legend known for his work with TLC and Mariah Carey, driving her from a business where women had little autonomy. In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Reid did not address the specific claims but apologized if his words were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misinterpreted.‚<U+0080>ùBlack women, especially, felt powerless against Mr. Simmons and his cohort in the small world of urban music, with several saying that misconduct against them could go unchecked because their place in the industry was so tenuous. They feared being ostracized, or worse.Three of the women now accusing Mr. Simmons were pursuing careers in the music industry that they said were disrupted or derailed in part by their experiences with him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sing for almost a year,‚<U+0080>ù said Tina Baker, a performer who said Mr. Simmons raped her in the early ‚<U+0080><U+0099>90s, when he was her manager. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The second he agreed to work with me, my budget increased, the label was paying more attention to me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker recalled. But after the assault, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into oblivion.‚<U+0080>ùFirst known as a hyperactive party promoter turned manager from Queens who helped boost Run-DMC, Mr. Simmons was among the first to view hip-hop as a big business and cultural force. In 1983, with the producer Rick Rubin, he made Def Jam the defining rap label of its era, with hits by the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Public Enemy.Even after Mr. Simmons sold his remaining stake in Def Jam for a reported $100 million in 1999, he served as an ambassador for hip-hop through comedy (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Def Comedy Jam‚<U+0080>ù), clothing (Phat Farm) and activism. Today, his company Rush Communications oversees an array of businesses and nonprofits.In 1987, Toni Sallie, a music journalist for the trade magazine Black Radio Exclusive, met Mr. Simmons while on assignment. She found him to be a charming, if gruff, playboy. They ended up going on a few dates before Ms. Sallie, then 28, decided they were not a match.But the two remained cordial, Ms. Sallie said, and in the fall of 1988, Mr. Simmons invited her to his Manhattan apartment for a party he said he was hosting for his girlfriend. When Ms. Sallie arrived, the place was empty except for Mr. Simmons, she recalled. Saying he wanted to show her the apartment, Mr. Simmons led her to his bedroom.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He pushed me on the bed and jumped on top of me, and physically attacked me,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We were fighting. I said no.‚<U+0080>ù He raped her, she said. Two friends, Sheila Brody and Arlene Hirschkowitz, and a colleague confirmed that Ms. Sallie told them about the assault around the time it happened.Through his lawyer, Brad D. Rose, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he dated Ms. Sallie but denied any nonconsensual sex.Ms. Sallie said she was too afraid to report the assault: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I went to the police, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how that would turn out.‚<U+0080>ùShe also worried about her burgeoning career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to understand, I was very much in a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s game,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Sallie said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Black women were just starting to break into the field.‚<U+0080>ùAbout a year later, at a music conference in South Florida, Ms. Sallie, who was then working for Warner Bros. Records, said she encountered Mr. Simmons in a hotel lobby. When he tried to lead her to a dark beach, she resisted and he attacked her, grabbing her by the hair, she said, and even chasing her into the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s restroom before she escaped to her room, where she barricaded the door. (‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did Mr. Simmons conduct himself inappropriately,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rose said.)To this day, Ms. Sallie said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t feel comfortable in a room full of men.‚<U+0080>ùMusic executives she told about the hotel incident brushed it off, she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt alone for 29 years,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like nobody would listen to me.‚<U+0080>ùFollowing the reports of alleged misconduct by Mr. Simmons in November, Ms. Sallie said she contacted the Manhattan district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to accuse him.A law enforcement official confirmed that a woman contacted the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to report an incident from 1988 and added that a different anonymous woman had recently reported an incident from 1991. The official said the incidents had occurred so long ago that the statute of limitations had lapsed and the crimes had not been prosecuted. There are no details about the woman from the 1991 incident.But the official said the women had been referred to the New York Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Special Victims squad so that there would be a record of their complaints if more recent allegations were to emerge.Ms. Baker, the singer, thought Mr. Simmons could elevate her career as her new manager. She had performed as a backup vocalist for Madonna and Bruce Springsteen, and, as Tina B, released pop and dance records in the 1980s.One night in late 1990 or early 1991, she ran into Mr. Simmons at a club, and he invited her back to his apartment to discuss her career. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think anything of going,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, having been there many times without incident.This time, though, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it all got really ugly, pretty fast,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. As soon as they entered, Mr. Simmons started pouring drinks and trying to kiss her, leading to a scuffle, she said. She recalled ‚<U+0080><U+009C>him on top of me, pushing me down and him saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fight me,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said. She was pinned on the bed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I did nothing, I shut my eyes and waited for it to end.‚<U+0080>ùShe cried the whole way home, she said. In interviews and email, her ex-husband, Arthur Baker, a music producer; her psychologist, Dr. Robin Goldberg; another therapist; and a former roommate all confirmed that she told them she was raped.Mr. Simmons, through his lawyer, said he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no recollection of ever having any sexual relations with Ms. Baker.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the assault, Ms. Baker remained tethered to Mr. Simmons professionally, she said. She returned to his apartment for a meeting; Mr. Simmons liked to conduct business while working out in his penthouse. But as soon as he stopped exercising, she said, he pulled out his penis and moved toward her. She fled.Amid strife with her label, she tried to extricate herself from her contract with Mr. Simmons, she said, but he ignored her. Her music ‚<U+0080><U+0094> two years‚<U+0080><U+0099> worth of songwriting and recording ‚<U+0080><U+0094> languished. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a deep depression,‚<U+0080>ù she said, and her recording career foundered.Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>did everything he could to professionally promote her career‚<U+0080>ù while Ms. Baker was signed to a label, and then stopped representing her, according to his lawyer.The events took a heavy toll on her romantic relationships. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have sex with a man for almost nine years,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Baker, now a lawyer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into a cocoon.‚<U+0080>ùDrew Dixon left Stanford University in 1992 to join the hip-hop revolution.After about two years on the fringes of the business, Ms. Dixon ‚<U+0080><U+0094> whose mother, Sharon Pratt, was mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 until 1995 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had a professional breakthrough: Russell Simmons, whom she had met through friends, was looking for a new A&R executive at Def Jam to scout talent and coordinate hit records.She said he was a decadent figure, complete with a Rolls-Royce ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>living, breathing personification of hip-hop and glamour mixed up‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and his sexual advances started right away and became relentless. At a restaurant, Mr. Simmons pushed Ms. Dixon into a broom closet, she said, and tried to kiss her. At work, he would close the door to her office and expose himself, leading her to give a copy of her key to a male co-worker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>If I ever buzz you, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pick up, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t call me back ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just open my door. That means Russell is in here and he whipped his‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù penis out, she said.Through his lawyer, Mr. Simmons acknowledged that he engaged in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>inappropriate conduct‚<U+0080>ù with Ms. Dixon while she worked at Def Jam.Fending him off ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was a full-time job,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Ms. Dixon knew Mr. Simmons valued her expertise. She had an ear for emerging talent, even bringing a rising Notorious B.I.G. to the office.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cut off my one conduit to having any hope of a career,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought if I could survive long enough to have a hit ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a real bona fide hit with my name on it ‚<U+0080><U+0094> I would move categories,‚<U+0080>ù from sexual object to respected colleague.In 1995, Ms. Dixon thought she had found her lifeline. Her first major project ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a soundtrack for the music documentary ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show,‚<U+0080>ù featuring Tupac and A Tribe Called Quest ‚<U+0080><U+0094> went platinum. She and Mr. Simmons were listed as executive producers.One night, as she left the Bowery Bar near Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apartment to get cab money from an A.T.M., she ran into him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have the No. 1 record in the country; I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll order you a car,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled him saying.Waiting for the ride, she let her guard down and entered his apartment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I remember realizing I was cornered,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Dixon, who said she rejected Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual advances that night directly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>many ways to say no‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as well as explaining that she had just had a gynecological procedure and could not have sex. He told her he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t care, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and I just blacked out.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>The last thing I remember was him pinning me down to kiss me on the bed,‚<U+0080>ù she said. The next thing she recalled was being in Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hot tub, both of them naked and Mr. Simmons gleeful. (Ms. Dixon said she had not been drinking and did not think she had been drugged; rather, she said, she had disassociated from the experience.)Denise Gayle, a friend who was then staying with Ms. Dixon, recalled her coming home in a daze. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She pretty much told me right away that he had sexually assaulted her, that she had told him no, cried and that he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be interested in stopping,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Gayle said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She mentally deteriorated instantly.‚<U+0080>ù Three others confirmed that Ms. Dixon told them about the assault and harassment around that time.Mr. Simmons ‚<U+0080><U+009C>emphatically states that he did not have sex with her,‚<U+0080>ù his lawyer said.Soon after, Ms. Dixon said she composed her resignation letter to Def Jam by hand, humiliated and in a panic, crossing out her mistakes rather than starting again. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was going to give up,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Dixon considered escaping to graduate school. But the success of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Show‚<U+0080>ù soundtrack had made her taste a commodity, and she started at Arista Records, as an A&R executive under Clive Davis, in 1996. She enjoyed more success, helping to orchestrate smash singles like Whitney Houston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My Love Is Your Love,‚<U+0080>ù Aretha Franklin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Rose Is Still a Rose,‚<U+0080>ù and Santana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Maria Maria.‚<U+0080>ùBut even at Arista, the long shadow of Def Jam remained, partly over a dispute about what she said were unpaid business expenses. Ms. Dixon hired a lawyer and threatened to sue Mr. Simmons for sexual harassment, as well as outstanding bills from the label. In 1997, the parties settled out of court. Mr. Rose, Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, confirmed the settlement.Ms. Dixon said she accepted about $30,000 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> around $3,000 for the expenses and the rest for legal fees ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and stayed quiet. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I do not want to be famous for being sexually harassed by Russell Simmons,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said, citing the lingering criticism of black women like Anita Hill, and Desiree Washington, who accused Mike Tyson of rape. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to make records and be famous for that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Dixon hoped to move on with her career at Arista. But in 2000, L.A. Reid replaced Mr. Davis atop the label. Mr. Reid began sexualizing her, Ms. Dixon said, and would turn cold when she denied his unwanted overtures.Ms. Dixon said she tried to parry his come-ons as best she could without offending him. But when she openly defied his demands ‚<U+0080><U+0094> declining his invitation to meet him late at night at his hotel; wearing jeans when he insisted on skirts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she worried that her artists would receive short shrift.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a quid pro quo: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have power, you want access, sleep with me ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m going to be really mean to you the next day. And there will be consequences,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Reid left this year as the chairman of Epic Records following accusations of sexual harassment. Told in detail of Ms. Dixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, he said in a statement to The Times: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m proud of my track record promoting, supporting and uplifting women at every company I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever run. That notwithstanding, if I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologize unreservedly.‚<U+0080>ùIn 2002, at the top of her game, Ms. Dixon left the music industry for Harvard Business School. She concluded that no matter how many hits she had, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I could not have success in this industry unless I slept with somebody ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a gatekeeper,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that I would be doing it to advance my career, I would hate myself.‚<U+0080>ùPost-Def Jam, Mr. Simmons rebranded his image from high-rolling modelizer, partying with Donald Trump and Naomi Campbell, to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Uncle Rush,‚<U+0080>ù a spiritual yogi and elder statesman. He released books like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Success Through Stillness‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Happy Vegan,‚<U+0080>ù while focusing on philanthropy and political advocacy.Ms. Dixon said that years after her experience with Mr. Simmons at Def Jam, he apologized to her at an industry event. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I have daughters and I do yoga now, Drew, and I know what I did was wrong, and I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Dixon said.Yet this Mr. Simmons is not the one that Christina Moore said she encountered in Miami at Art Basel in 2014. Ms. Moore, who was 26 at the time, and a friend bumped into Mr. Simmons in the elevator of Soho Beach House.The women were meeting friends at a bar there, but were lost, Ms. Moore said. Mr. Simmons suggested he knew where to go. Ms. Moore and her friend followed him; he led them to his room. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt duped,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Immediately, Mr. Simmons began to run a bath, Ms. Moore said, and then pushed her up against a column in the room ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hands all over my body, up and down,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt assaulted.‚<U+0080>ù He told Ms. Moore that she was a bad girl and threatened to tie her up, she said. Ms. Moore and her friend bolted.Mr. Simmons recalled meeting Ms. Moore and her friend. He said the women followed him to his room of their own accord and asked him about getting into parties. His lawyer said running the bath was Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>signal to Ms. Moore and her friend to leave.‚<U+0080>ù He denied any misconduct.The whole interaction lasted about five minutes, Ms. Moore said, but it stayed with her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt a lot of shame and guilt at ending up in that situation,‚<U+0080>ù she said.When reports of Mr. Simmons‚<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged sexual misconduct began circulating, Ms. Moore grew more alarmed and decided to come forward. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would hate to think what would have happened if I were alone,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Baker, too, spent years feeling guilt over how she handled the situation with Mr. Simmons. After the Weinstein revelations, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I started to get very agitated and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Baker said, scanning for mentions of misconduct by Mr. Simmons. She concluded that she had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>moral duty‚<U+0080>ù to tell her story.Ms. Sallie said speaking out was a form of affirmation, and relief. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I still cry,‚<U+0080>ù she said. But, she added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m happy that the truth is coming out. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m ready.‚<U+0080>ùThe professional price Ms. Dixon paid was steep, she said. She cannot listen to the taste-shifting music she helped create; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too emotionally taxing. Her promising career was curtailed, her ear for talent wasted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I gave up something that I loved to do,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I erased myself.‚<U+0080>ùNow, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want people to know why.‚<U+0080>ùMAIDUGURI, Nigeria ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The camp was supposed to be a refuge. Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life had been stolen by war ever since the sixth grade, when she was abducted from her home and raped repeatedly by Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fighters for the next three years.She finally escaped last spring, slipping into the bush while her captors slept. Fourteen years old and alone, she made it to a camp for victims of the war, and had just settled in for the night when she heard footsteps outside her tent. A security officer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice instructed her to come out. Frightened, she obeyed.He took her to his quarters, she said, and raped her.Hours later, after she had returned to her tent, another officer arrived, she said. He raped her, too.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The same day I was brought there, soldiers started coming to rape me,‚<U+0080>ù Falmata said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They did it one after another. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure those two knew about each other.‚<U+0080>ùRape has been a defining horror of the war with Boko Haram, which has consumed northeastern Nigeria for eight years and spread beyond its borders. At least 7,000 women and girls have endured Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sexual violence, the United Nations estimates. Militants kidnap and rape young girls, teenagers and women, handing them out as so-called brides who are sometimes passed from fighter to fighter.But Nigerian security forces have also raped victims of the war, preying on the people they are assigned to protect. Dozens of cases of rape, sexual violence and sexual exploitation were reported in seven camps in Borno State last year alone, carried out by guards, camp officials, security officers and members of civilian vigilante groups, the United Nations says.More than a year ago, the Nigerian government pledged to investigate the allegations of rape in camps for people displaced by the war, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>these very distressing reports will not be taken lightly.‚<U+0080>ù But accounts of sexual assaults in the camps are still common, including from young girls who say they were raped by soldiers on many occasions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The soldiers would come and hold me so tight,‚<U+0080>ù one 13-year-old girl said in an interview. She said she had been raped about 10 times this year at a camp in Maiduguri, the city at the center of the fight against Boko Haram, before running away for her own safety.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They were old enough to be my parents,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the soldiers who raped her.The Nigerian military has cleared parts of the countryside to hunt for Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hide-outs, forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians to move into huge settlements throughout northeastern Nigeria. Many other civilians have made it to the camps on their own after fleeing Boko Haram‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deadly assaults.Most of the camps are overflowing, with new arrivals every day. Food and water are often in short supply, residents say, and health workers are battling a cholera outbreak that has killed dozens.At night, the camps are dimly lit. Aid workers come during the day, but typically not after sunset because of wartime curfews. Security forces tightly control who goes in and out of the camps, sometimes coercing women and girls to trade sex for food.Government officials say they need 24-hour security to protect the residents, especially since some of the camps are regular targets of suicide bombers deployed by Boko Haram.But in one camp, called Teachers Village, some residents said the security forces had worked out a system to select their victims. Young women were called to cook for them. After the women finished, security officers insisted that they clean up, telling them to go bathe in the officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> quarters as the men watched.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At first none of us knew they were doing this, but then the stories started to spread around camp that anyone cooking for them would be raped,‚<U+0080>ù said Hadiza, 18.After living in the camp for several weeks, Hadiza said, she was picked to cook for the officers. She was terrified.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Definitely my time has come,‚<U+0080>ù she recalled thinking.Later, she was asked to serve water to four security officers in their room as they dined. One by one they left, she said, until only one man remained. He dragged her into a separate room and raped her, she said.Hadiza was injured, she said, but didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ask for medical care, fearing that the officers would seek revenge. She said she tried to keep a low profile for a couple of weeks, but officers spotted her and raped her again. She said she had been raped as many as 20 times in the camp.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once they identified you as a girl they wanted to have sex with, they would hardly leave you alone a single day,‚<U+0080>ù Hadiza said.By spring, word of the rapes at Teachers Village camp had spread so widely across Maiduguri that people began showing up at the gates to look for missing relatives. Distant relatives arrived for Hadiza and took her away.Last year, President Muhammadu Buhari called for an investigation into sexual assaults at the camps after Human Rights Watch detailed the abuse in a report, ordering new measures to protect the vulnerable. Security officers have received more training, and at least 100 female officers have been deployed inside the camps. As a result, the number of complaints of sexual abuse has declined, according to some aid groups and the police.The police have arrested several men for sexually abusing and exploiting women and girls, according to the United States Embassy. The arrests, made last December, include two police officers, a prison warden, two civilian militia members, a civil servant and three soldiers.But an Army Special Board of Inquiry said in June that allegations against its soldiers at the camps were unfounded, while Jimoh Moshood, a police spokesman, said the investigations were continuing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Very little progress has been made by Nigerian authorities to implement President Buhari‚<U+0080><U+0099>s promise of justice for the survivors,‚<U+0080>ù said Mausi Segun, the executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The delay reinforces displaced people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sense of helplessness, and likely emboldens more perpetrators to prey on their vulnerability.‚<U+0080>ùIn the war with Boko Haram, Nigerian security forces have been accused of many human rights abuses, including killing innocent civilians and detaining children for months to determine their loyalties.At checkpoints to enter Maiduguri, soldiers and militia members have turned away large groups of displaced people fleeing Boko Haram, unless they can pay an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>entrance fee,‚<U+0080>ù aid workers say. People escaping with their herds are sometimes charged a fee for each animal. Those who can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t pay the bribes have been sent back into harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.Inside the camps, soldiers and members of civilian vigilante groups have been accused of forcing people to pay for the privilege of setting up tents or leaky shelters made of tarps and grass. Some displaced people told Amnesty International that they had to sell their belongings to survive, and when they ran out of things to sell, they had to have sex with soldiers and civilian militia members to get food.Falmata, the 14-year-old kidnapped by Boko Haram, said her ordeal began when she was in primary school, enjoying her classwork and dancing to local Kanuri music.Militants stormed into her home and took her while she was caring for her sick mother. They forced her to marry a fighter, but that man died in battle a week later, so they gave her to another husband. She tried to resist, so they gave her a third. Barely a teenager by then, she became pregnant, she said, but the baby died days after he was born.One night, Falmata woke up and realized the whole camp was asleep. Now was the time, she thought. She ran until she reached a village, finding an older woman with a lantern who pointed her to a road. Soldiers spotted her and took her to Dalori Camp, a sprawling site outside Maiduguri.She thought she was being delivered to safety ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but immediately faced the same kind of sexual abuse she had risked her life to flee. And this time it was being committed by the people who were there to protect her.During her two months at the camp, she said, security officers, not always the same men, came for her repeatedly. Falmata described the men as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>soldiers,‚<U+0080>ù but it was unclear if they were members of the military, the police or another security force. She said they carried weapons.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt it would continue forever,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the abuse.She knew she had to flee, again, so she asked for a pass to go to the market. She walked out of the camp the same way she had escaped Boko Haram: alone, with no money and no idea where she was going.As a little girl, she remembered, she had visited her grandmother once in Maiduguri, but she had only a vague idea where. Falmata spotted a man she had seen around the camp who spoke her dialect, and begged for help.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Look, I have a problem,‚<U+0080>ù she told him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>These people are going to kill me. They come to me every night.‚<U+0080>ùThe two drove around the city for hours, trying to track down Falmata‚<U+0080><U+0099>s grandmother, asking everyone. Eventually, they found her. She had thought Falmata was dead.Falmata now lives with her grandmother, but is too ashamed to tell her what happened. Someday, she hopes to continue her education and become a lawyer. She wants to represent the powerless.The 17-year-old migrant was pregnant. She said she had been raped in her home county, and she knew from the timing that she was carrying her attacker‚<U+0080><U+0099>s child.She wanted to terminate her pregnancy. But she was underage and undocumented, and, after she was caught crossing the border illegally, living in a government shelter.The Trump administration official in charge of her care decided not to grant her access to an abortion ‚<U+0080><U+0094> because, he said, abortion was itself a form of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>violence.‚<U+0080>ùA woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s desire to end a pregnancy springing from rape might be ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understandable,‚<U+0080>ù wrote Scott Lloyd, the director of the federal agency that oversees the shelter, in his denial memo on Sunday. But, he wrote, it was not possible to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cure violence with further violence.‚<U+0080>ùHe went on: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We cannot be a place of refuge while we are at the same time a place of violence. We have to choose, and we ought to choose protect life rather than to destroy it.‚<U+0080>ùIt took a lawsuit, a federal court order and an unexpected reversal this week for Jane Poe, as the teenager is known in court papers, to secure access to an abortion. Yet Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo, released by government lawyers in court on Thursday, spells out a fervently uncompromising opposition to abortion that all but guarantees further clashes at the charged intersection of abortion and immigration.The agency Mr. Lloyd leads, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, announced in March that it would prohibit federally funded shelters from taking ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any action that facilitates‚<U+0080>ù an abortion for an unaccompanied minor without his approval. The Trump administration has said that there is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no constitutional right‚<U+0080>ù for young women in the office‚<U+0080><U+0099>s custody to obtain an abortion.The director has personally gone to meet with pregnant teenagers in immigration custody to persuade them not to have abortions, drawing accusations from abortion rights advocates that he is forcing his beliefs onto the young women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This latest revelation exposes the Trump administration‚<U+0080><U+0099>s extreme anti-abortion ideology: It seeks to force women to continue pregnancies against their will,‚<U+0080>ù said Brigitte Amiri, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represented Jane Poe and two other teenagers who also won the rights to get abortions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will continue to fight to strike down this cruel and heartless policy.‚<U+0080>ùOn Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s agency declined to comment on his views on abortion. In October, a spokesman told The Washington Post: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a child in the program who is pregnant, he has been reaching out to her and trying to help as much as possible with life-affirming options.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>He by law has custody of these children,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman continued, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and just like a foster parent, he knows that that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot of responsibility, and he is going to make choices that he thinks are best for both the mother and the child.‚<U+0080>ùThe Trump administration had originally opposed a federal judge‚<U+0080><U+0099>s order on Monday to allow Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abortion. Then, for reasons it has not explained, it dropped its legal appeal, clearing Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s path. (She still faces the possibility of deportation.)Government lawyers had pushed to keep Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sealed in court, but agreed to release part of it on Thursday after the A.C.L.U. argued for its unsealing. The group has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy.Though Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers have disclosed almost no information about her out of concerns for her safety and privacy, Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo sketches the outlines of her situation. She told shelter workers that she had been raped in her home country, and though she had a boyfriend with whom she had had sex, both she and federal officials came to believe, based on the timing of her assault, that her pregnancy resulted from the rape. She arrived at the border several weeks after the attack.When the shelter confirmed that she was pregnant, she asked for an abortion, only to change her mind after she said her mother had threatened to beat her if she got one. A few days later, however, she decided that she wanted it, and later threatened to hurt herself if she did not receive it. She was nearly 22 weeks pregnant when Mr. Lloyd said no.Mr. Lloyd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo describes the abortion procedure, known as dilation and evacuation, that she would have to undergo at that stage of pregnancy as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one that even many abortionists find troublesome.‚<U+0080>ù He cites anecdotal evidence, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>impossible to ignore,‚<U+0080>ù that abortions can be a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating trauma‚<U+0080>ù for women, even as he concedes that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>formal research on this matter appears to be sparse.‚<U+0080>ù An abortion would not only fail to erase her trauma, he wrote, but also might ‚<U+0080><U+009C>further traumatize her.‚<U+0080>ùBecause many immigrants are sexually assaulted in their home countries or on the journey through Central America and Mexico to the southern border, cases like Jane‚<U+0080><U+0099>s are likely to recur.A Gallup poll this year showed that 18 percent of Americans believe that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, a share that has not changed significantly for many years. Half of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances and 29 percent said it should always be legal, according to the poll.The House recently passed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, a measure the White House supports, but it contains an exception for cases of rape. It is unlikely to pass the Senate, where most Democrats and some Republicans generally oppose new laws restricting abortions.KABUL, Afghanistan ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Taliban on Sunday denied an assertion by a freed Canadian hostage that his American wife had been raped during their five years of captivity and that their infant had been killed by the Haqqani network, a brutal arm of the Afghan insurgency.The militants said the child had died during a miscarriage.Soon after arriving in Toronto on Friday with his wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their three children, the former captive, Joshua Boyle, said she had been raped by members of the Haqqani network.He also said the network had authorized ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the murder of my infant daughter,‚<U+0080>ù their fourth child. Ms. Coleman was pregnant when the couple were abducted in 2012 while traveling in Afghanistan.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, rejected the accusations of rape as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fabricated claims‚<U+0080>ù fed to Mr. Boyle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From the beginning up to their freedom, the wife and the husband were not separated even for a few minutes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the reason for that was to avoid any suspicions,‚<U+0080>ù the spokesman said by telephone.When Ms. Coleman was about to deliver the child, Mr. Mujahid said, there were no doctors in the area where they were being held.‚<U+0080><U+009C>One female child was naturally miscarried,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Mujahid said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No one has intentionally killed the child or carried out any other abuse on them. If that was our plan, they would not have gone home with three children.‚<U+0080>ùMany questions about the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s travels to Afghanistan, their captivity and their eventual release remain unanswered. Several members of the Taliban leadership reached by phone repeated the lines put out in their statement without offering new details.Mr. Mujahid also declined to talk about how the couple had been freed, saying that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>only the few people guarding them‚<U+0080>ù had details of the release and that he was still trying to reach those people.Pakistani officials have said that the family was freed in northwestern tribal areas of the country after their forces acted on intelligence provided to them by the United States.At a news conference, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the spokesman for the Pakistani military, said its forces had managed to trace the vehicle carrying the hostages within five hours of a tip from the United States, and had rescued the hostages after blowing out the vehicle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tires. The captors ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fled on foot,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Mr. Boyle, in a video message posted by the Pakistani military soon after their freedom, effusively thanked the Pakistani military for a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tremendously professional operation,‚<U+0080>ù and said the military and intelligence forces ‚<U+0080><U+009C>got between the car and the criminals to make sure the prisoners were safe and that my family was safe.‚<U+0080>ùAmerican officials have expressed gratitude to Pakistan for the release, and President Trump called it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a positive moment‚<U+0080>ù in the countries‚<U+0080><U+0099> relationship. The release came as pressure by the Trump administration seemed to be mounting on Pakistan for its ties to the Afghan insurgency.American officials have said repercussions could be severe if Pakistan failed to curtail its support for the Afghan insurgency, and in particular, continue to allow a haven for its leaders, including the Haqqanis.But Afghan officials in Kabul viewed the hostage release as an old Pakistani trick of offering the United States a concession each time the pressure builds. A senior Afghan official said that two and a half years ago, its intelligence service had concluded that the family had been moved across the border into Pakistan, and that the information had been shared with the Americans.In recent years, the Haqqani network has become increasingly integrated with the mainstream Taliban. The network‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, serves as the Taliban‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deputy supreme leader and has played an important role in the insurgency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s military victories.But the network still maintains its special skills, including hostage-taking and carrying out some of the more sophisticated attacks and bombings in cities like Kabul. The group previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, one of Sirajuddin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s half brothers, in exchange for the freedom of the North American family.The Haqqanis are believed to be still holding Kevin King, a professor of the American University of Afghanistan who was kidnapped in Kabul in 2016; and another American, Paul Overby, whose family said the Haqqanis abducted him in 2014 after he tried to interview the group‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leader.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was exhausting. It was like making a record while swimming in rough seas.‚<U+0080>ùDREW DIXON, a former executive at Def Jam Records, who said fending off advances from the label‚<U+0080><U+0099>s co-founder Russell Simmons was a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>full-time job.‚<U+0080>ù She has accused Mr. Simmons of sexual assault.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A growing national outcry over sexual harassment reached the Senate on Thursday, when a radio newscaster accused Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office.Mr. Franken, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, almost immediately released an apology to the newscaster, Leeann Tweeden, who said that Mr. Franken forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal and groped her for a photo as she slept. After initially apologizing without fully acknowledging all of her accusations, he then released another lengthier, more contrite statement that contested nothing.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Franken wrote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I respect women. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t respect men who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t,‚<U+0080>ù he continued. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.‚<U+0080>ùThe storm that enveloped Mr. Franken in a matter of hours marked a merger of sorts between the harassment scandals darkening the political world and the grave misconduct marring the entertainment industry. Republicans are still struggling to resolve their quandary with Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.President Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and has refrained from weighing in on the accusations against Mr. Moore, wrote on Twitter late Thursday that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued the tweet in a cruder manner: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?‚<U+0080>ùEarlier, response from Republicans and Democrats alike was swift and unsparing. Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the Senate leaders, wasted no time before forwarding the matter to the Senate Ethics Committee ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a move supported by Democrats, including Mr. Franken. Lawmakers did stop short of meting out a punishment on a fellow senator, and it appeared that Mr. Franken would be able to weather the disclosure.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in the workplace or anywhere else.‚<U+0080>ùDemocrats gave Mr. Franken no quarter.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is unacceptable behavior and extremely disappointing. I am glad Al came out and apologized, but that doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t reverse what he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done or end the matter. I support an ethics committee investigation into these accusations and I hope this latest example of the deep problems on this front spurs continued action to address it,‚<U+0080>ù said Patty Murray of Washington, one of the most senior Democratic women in the Senate.The realm of comedy, which spawned the charges against Louis C.K., has been particularly suspect, and Mr. Franken, who emerged from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live‚<U+0080>ù as a nationally known celebrity, appeared to acknowledge that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coming from the world of comedy, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive,‚<U+0080>ù he wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the intentions behind my actions aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the point at all. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s taken me so long to come to terms with that.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Tweeden published a first-person account of the incident on KABC Radio in Los Angeles on Thursday. She wrote that it occurred in December 2006, not long before Christmas, when she was a performer for the tour alongside Mr. Franken, then a well-known comedian. Ms. Tweeden was then a Fox Sports Network correspondent and model. U.S.O. tours are meant to boost morale among American troops abroad and typically include celebrity entertainment.She also presented evidence, including a photograph of Mr. Franken, his head turned toward the camera, with his hands placed over Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breasts as she slept.According to Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, Mr. Franken wrote a bawdy script that included a kiss for the two to perform onstage. When it came time to rehearse the skit, she wrote, Mr. Franken insisted on kissing despite her protestations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be so nice about it the next time,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt disgusted and violated,‚<U+0080>ù she added.Ms. Tweeden said that no one else witnessed the kiss, and she did not tell the tour‚<U+0080><U+0099>s organizers. She said Mr. Franken retaliated against her with insults and, she learned after the trip ended, the compromising photograph.Ms. Tweeden said the photograph was taken while she was asleep on a flight back to the United States from Afghanistan and that she saw it only later, after the trip ended.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s funny?‚<U+0080>ùSpeaking on air on KABC Thursday morning, Ms. Tweeden, a former model, said that women were too often blamed for provoking male aggression based on their looks or clothing. She told reporters later that she would accept Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apology.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The apology? Sure. I accept it,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People make mistakes.‚<U+0080>ùAsked if she would call on Mr. Franken to step down, Ms. Tweeden said no, barring the emergence of new accusations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not my place,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Ms. Tweeden wrote that she had been compelled to share the story after an on-air conversation with Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, who has been a leading voice sounding alarms about sexual harassment on Capitol Hill in recent weeks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to have the same effect on them that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Tweeden wrote. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want them, and all the other victims of sexual assault, to be able to speak out immediately, and not keep their stories ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and their anger ‚<U+0080><U+0094> locked up inside for years, or decades.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Speier and others have labored to force Congress to begin grappling with sexual aggression that has long been a part of work life on Capitol Hill. She testified at a House hearing on the topic on Tuesday that helped draw increased scrutiny of the sort that has already begun to take place in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and newsrooms in New York and Washington.Mr. Trump has also been accused of sexual harassment. Shortly before the presidential election last year, a 2005 recording surfaced that showed Mr. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about women. The recording captured Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and bragging that he could get away with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>anything‚<U+0080>ù because of his celebrity.Others have recounted unwelcome romantic advances and unsettling workplace conduct, including at the offices of Trump Tower and backstage at beauty pageants.Even before the accusations against Mr. Franken, lawmakers in both the Senate and House had moved to begin mandatory anti-harassment training for all Capitol Hill employees and interns.Ms. Tweeden‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story came one day after Ms. Speier and four other lawmakers, including Representative Ryan Costello, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Representative Bruce Poliquin, Republican of Maine, introduced legislation to overhaul the way sexual harassment and assault are reported in Congress.Congressional aides, lawyers and lobbyists say the existing system is convoluted, and has long been stacked against those wishing to speak out against an abuser: The current process requires nondisclosure agreements and can take up to six months before a formal complaint is filed.The proposed legislation would make anonymity optional, as well as require lawmakers to reimburse the United States Treasury for paying out any settlements to victims.While his fellow senators rushed to rebuke him, Mr. Franken hunkered down out of sight, skipping four votes in the Senate and the Democrats‚<U+0080><U+0099> regularly scheduled luncheon.Senator Amy Klobuchar, Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fellow Minnesota Democrat, condemned his actions and like other senators called for an Ethics Committee query.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This should not have happened to Leeann Tweeden,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Klobuchar said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another example of why we need to change work environments and reporting practices across the nation, including in Congress.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Johnny Isakson, the Ethics Committee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Republican chairman, cited committee rules in saying that he could not comment on a prospective investigation.Republicans, eager to talk about sexual accusations other than Mr. Moore‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, tried to turn the allegations to their political favor. The campaign committees of Republican Senate and House candidates sent out a blizzard of news releases demanding that Democrats denounce Mr. Franken and return campaign contributions that he had made.Lisbeth Kaufman, who worked for Mr. Franken during his first term while she was in her mid-20s, said Mr. Franken never behaved inappropriately in the office to her knowledge, and recalled him as a focused and intelligent lawmaker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are predators on the Hill for sure,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kaufman, 31, said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And there are so many terrible stories. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve heard them myself. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve never heard such stories about Senator Franken.‚<U+0080>ùRussell Simmons has once again been accused of rape. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.In the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.The complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vehemently‚<U+0080>ù denied all of the allegations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests.‚<U+0080>ùOver the past few months, Mr. Simmons has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault or rape by multiple women, and is the focus of a police investigation in New York City. In January, an aspiring filmmaker named Jennifer Jarosik filed a $5 million lawsuit that claimed Mr. Simmons attacked her during a 2016 visit to his home. He stepped down from his companies in November.DETROIT ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A former Michigan State University dean, who supervised the doctor at the center of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, was himself charged on Tuesday with criminal sexual conduct involving medical school students.A student at the College of Osteopathic Medicine accused William Strampel, 70, of forcible sexual contact, prosecutors said in papers filed in state district court in East Lansing. Prosecutors said other students also accused Strampel of sexual misconduct.The charges emerged during a probe into how Michigan State handled complaints about the gymnastics doctor, special prosecutor William Forsyth told reporters in Lansing. The focus widened after investigators received a tip.The new charges, which Strampel's attorney denied, make the university a bigger target for the ""#MeToo"" movement that has engulfed powerful men across society in harassment and abuse allegations.""We did what we felt we needed to do and it led us to where we are today,"" Forsyth said.Strampel was dean from 2002 until the end of 2017. He supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar, who has been sentenced to prison for sexually abusing female gymnasts.The four criminal counts against Nassar's former boss include fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The accusations also include failing to properly oversee Nassar, whose scandal sparked probes into why the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and the university failed for years to investigate complaints.After a short hearing in state court in East Lansing, Strampel's attorney John Dakmak told reporters, ""My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone. He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors.""Regarding the charges relating to Strampel's supervision of Nassar, Dakmak said his client immediately involved other school officials in 2014 when the complaints surfaced and fired Nassar in 2016 when the sexual assault allegations were made.Michigan State's interim President John Engler said in a statement that one of his first actions upon his appointment in early February was moving to fire Strampel. Engler called the allegations against the former dean ""disturbing.""""Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges confirm our belief that he has fallen short of what is expected and required from academic leadership,"" Engler said.Four female medical students told investigators Strampel made sexually suggestive comments during meetings, including what some perceived as academic privileges in exchange for sex. Two accused him of grabbing their buttocks without consent.One student described meeting with Strampel in June 2017 to appeal a test score and feeling intimidated when he mentioned her age, saying: ""26-year-old women can 'put out' for 20 minutes with an old man ... and in return the women could get the benefit of a free vacation,"" according to court documents.Another witness said Strampel suggested she become a centerfold model and related to her how another student had become a stripper to pay for school, court documents said.When Strampel agreed to let the student retake a test, he said she must agree to do anything for him, which she interpreted as a request for sex, court documents said.Strampel is also accused of using his position as dean to receive pornographic images of women ""through threats and manipulation,"" court documents said. They said investigators seized his computer in February and found about 50 photos of nude women, sex toys and pornography, including selfies of female students, pornographic videos and a video of Nassar performing ""treatment"" on a young female patient.Strampel, handcuffed hands clasped in his lap and his legs crossed, appeared at his arraignment via video feed. A split screen showed him expressing little emotion as he interacted with the judge.Judge Richard Ball, citing a lack of criminal history, set a $25,000 personal recognizance bond, meaning Strampel need not post a cash bond. A preliminary hearing is set for May 3.If convicted, he faces five years and a possible fine of $10,000 for a misconduct in office charge, two years and a possible fine of $500 for the fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charge and one year and a possible fine of $1,000 for each of the two willful neglect of duty charges, according to court documents.An attorney for more than 150 of Nassar's victims said his clients were encouraged by the charges against Strampel.The charges demonstrate that officials are ""serious about investigating the systemic misconduct at MSU that led to the largest child sex abuse scandal in history and holding the responsible parties accountable,"" John Manly said in a statement.Michigan State has been criticized for its handling of Nassar, 54, who was a faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic. Athletes had complained about Nassar since the 1990s, but the school did not open an investigation until 2014.Nassar was fired in September 2016. He received sentences this year that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life.(Additional reporting by Rebecca Cook in East Lansing, Michigan, Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by David Gregorio)OTTAWA ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Joshua Boyle, the Canadian man who was held hostage along with his American wife in Afghanistan for five years, has been arrested and faces 15 criminal charges, court records show.The charges include sexual assault, forcible confinement, drugging and assault, and all involve events that happened after Mr. Boyle and his family returned to Canada in mid-October. Court documents show that Mr. Boyle was arrested on Monday.Since being freed by Pakistani troops along with his wife, Caitlan Coleman Boyle, and their three children who were born in captivity, Mr. Boyle has described several gruesome episodes that he said occurred during their captivity. Among other things, he said that members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network raped Ms. Coleman and killed their fourth child, an infant.Ms. Coleman Boyle has said that the captors beat their eldest son.It is still unclear why the couple took what many viewed as an exceedingly dangerous trip into an unstable region of Afghanistan during 2012.The first of the events that led to the charges Mr. Boyle now faces, according to court documents, occurred on Oct. 14, and the most recent was on Dec. 30. The charges include misleading the police.A court order prohibits the publishing of anything that might identify the two people who the Ottawa Police say were Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victims.The Ottawa Police declined to comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mr. Boyle is presumed innocent,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, Eric Granger, wrote in an email on Tuesday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s never been in trouble before. No evidence has been provided yet, which is typical at this early stage.‚<U+0080>ùAfter their release in a dramatic raid, the family initially moved in with Mr. Boyle‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario, about an hour from Ottawa. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Boyle was living in an apartment in downtown Ottawa, court records show.Mr. Boyle, 34, was previously, and briefly, married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of Omar Khadr, the only Canadian held by the United States military in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. He also acted as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s spokesman.Canadian courts found that Mr. Khadr, who was 15 when captured, was unjustly held. He was offered a formal apology by the Canadian government and agreed to a substantial monetary settlement last year. But Ms. Khadr has been widely rebuked by Canadian politicians and others for many of her public statements, including a defense of terrorism.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> In a dusty, overheated rehearsal room near London Bridge, things were getting ghoulish. On a mocked-up stage set, a soprano wearing a mask with black buttons over her eyeholes was slamming a fake hand into a door, trying to make it look as if it had been severed. Around a table, two ‚<U+0080><U+009C>magic consultants‚<U+0080>ù were huddled around a miniature toy theater, debating what sort of fake mice would freak audiences out the most. Eerie, discordant chords drifted from another room: A trio was practicing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doomed,‚<U+0080>ù they seemed to be singing.It was the fourth week of rehearsals for the Royal Opera‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new adaptation of Neil Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Gothic children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s novella ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù, and no bumps in the night were being left to chance. The seven singers had memorized Mark-Anthony Turnage‚<U+0080><U+0099>s angular, complex score and had worked out where to stand and walk; today was all about making sure that the supernatural transformations required by Rory Mullarkey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s libretto happened where they were meant to. The piece presented an unusual number of challenges, sighed Aletta Collins, the director: Never before had she been required to work out how to throw someone through a mirror onstage, as happens at the climax of the action, let alone how one might recruit a mouse orchestra, which pops up in Act One.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing our level best,‚<U+0080>ù she said.In the 16 years since it was published, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline,‚<U+0080>ù a tale of a plucky girl who falls into a parallel universe and battles forces from the dark side, has developed a passionate fan base, selling more than a million copies. In 2009 there came a stop-motion movie, and there have been video game and comic book adaptations, too ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even an Off Broadway musical. Propelled by this, and by the astonishing success of other stories, such as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sandman‚<U+0080>ù series and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Gods,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman has become something of a cult figure, not just among the Comic-Con crowd, but in mainstream literary circles, too.Even so, the idea of making a fantasy novel into an avant-garde opera still seems like a leap ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not only because of the mice. But then Mr. Turnage has always had eclectic taste: His last opera, which had its debut seven years ago, focused on the wayward life and tranquilizer-fueled death of Anna Nicole Smith, and his orchestral and instrumental works have gleefully referenced Miles Davis, the paintings of Francis Bacon and Beyonc√©‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Single Ladies.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>If someone says you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, or shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do this, then I think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a very good reason to do it,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has to provoke me, otherwise I get bored.‚<U+0080>ùThough Mr. Gaiman hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been directly involved in this new version ‚<U+0080><U+0094> earlier this month he finished shooting a screen adaptation of his novel ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Omens,‚<U+0080>ù written with Terry Pratchett ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage and Mr. Mullarkey have had plenty to play with. The novel begins when little Coraline Jones discovers that a bricked-up door in the apartment she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s just moved into is a portal to a nightmarish ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other world.‚<U+0080>ù Trapped behind the door, she finds a figure with black buttons for eyes who coos that she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>other mother‚<U+0080>ù and promises her anything she desires, if only she agrees to stay ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for ever and always.‚<U+0080>ù Coraline‚<U+0080><U+0099>s journey home to her real parents is not only a coming-of-age story; it also becomes a mythic quest.A powerful, self-determined heroine, Coraline is more than a match for operatic heroines like Leonore in Beethoven‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fidelio‚<U+0080>ù or Rosina from Rossini‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Barber of Seville.‚<U+0080>ù The role is shared in the new production by the sopranos Mary Bevan and Robyn Allegra Parton.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a strong female character,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s powerful; she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to solve these things. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got a seven-year-old daughter. S he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too young to read the book, but she saw the film, and she was very taken with Coraline.‚<U+0080>ùAlthough the opera, like the novel, is aimed at young audiences ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Turnage has dedicated it to his daughter and his youngest son ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it goes to some genuinely disturbing places. The sense that evil lurks around every corner is palpable; there are heavy hints, too, of abuse in the plotline of parent-like figures who bribe a child to love them. While critics have often compared the book to Lewis Carroll, Mr. Gaiman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s universe is arguably closer to David Lynch or Stephen King in its atmosphere of suspenseful, what-lies-beneath horror.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted to write about how people who have your best interests at heart may not always pay you the kind of attention that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d like,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gaiman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And people who pay a lot of attention to you may not always have your best interests at heart.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Collins agreed that, despite its fairy-tale qualities, this narrative is not for the fainthearted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The story is: You can have anything you want in the whole wide world, as long as you let me sew buttons into your eyes,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Turnage clearly relishes the material‚<U+0080><U+0099>s otherworldly side; the score, written for 15 musicians, is astringent and occasionally violent, bringing to mind early chamber pieces such as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>On All Fours‚<U+0080>ù (1983) and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blood on the Floor‚<U+0080>ù (1996). But ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù does allow audiences some moments of fun. The composer said he enjoyed coming up with Broadway-ish music for the character of Mr. Bobo, an eccentric old man who dwells in the apartment above Coraline and conducts the mouse orchestra. Two retired actresses who live in the apartment beneath, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, are portrayed as divas of a certain age who issue Cassandra-like pronouncements about fate in high-voltage coloratura.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The fantasy element is so heightened,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Completely operatic.‚<U+0080>ùThe Royal Opera has staged eight new operas for young people and families in the last five years, among them Julian Philips‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How the Whale Became‚<U+0080>ù (2013), based on children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stories by Ted Hughes, and Adriano Adewale‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hatch‚<U+0080>ù (2017), billed as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sensory experience for children aged 2 to 5.‚<U+0080>ù The profusion indicates how seriously the company is trying to demolish the perceived barriers that surround the art form, and to attract new and more diverse audiences.The company is under continual pressure to justify its annual governmental subsidy of around $33 million annually ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the highest of any arts institution in Britain ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and has invested in co-productions with theater and dance companies around the country. It also runs school workshops and outreach projects in towns outside London, including in some of the region‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most deprived areas.Mr. Turnage, who grew up in Essex, not far from London, and was the first member of his family to get a college education, said he hoped audiences for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù would come from all walks of life. The opera world sometimes wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t as outward-facing as it should be, he suggested.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A lot of opera directors are making opera for other opera directors, and quite a few opera composers are writing for their peer group,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Although ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù has been in development for over four years, both he and Ms. Collins said that the theme of a young woman standing up for herself against the odds had acquired particular topicality in the context of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The classical world has experienced plentiful rumors about sexual harassment, along with some high-profile firings ‚<U+0080><U+0094> notably of the conductors Charles Dutoit and James Levine, who was pushed out of the Met earlier this month.Mr. Turnage said that, while some things had improved over his years in the business, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m acutely aware of women working in the opera world and the way that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re marginalized, and how tough it is. Everybody knows this.‚<U+0080>ùHe added he was proud that, as well as having created a strong female lead, the production also has a largely female creative team, led by Ms. Collins and the conductor Sian Edwards. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The world is changing,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnage said.He added that he hoped ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Coraline‚<U+0080>ù offered a path forward, in its way. He was inspired by a quotation from G.K. Chesterton that Mr. Gaiman uses as the epigraph of the book: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Fairy tales are more than true: Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.‚<U+0080>ùGov. Andrew M. Cuomo directed the state attorney general on Monday to review how the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., handled a 2015 sexual assault allegation against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.Mr. Vance decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein even though his accuser, an Italian model, had provided police officers with a recording of Mr. Weinstein apologizing when she asked him why he had groped her breasts the day before.Mr. Vance said at the time that there was insufficient evidence, a defense he repeated last year after an outpouring of accusations against Mr. Weinstein reopened scrutiny of the decision, and also cast light on Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s acceptance of campaign donations from Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are confident that any review will confirm that our office has pursued its investigation without fear or favor, based on the merits alone,‚<U+0080>ù Danny Frost, a spokesman for the district attorney, said in a statement on Monday evening. He said the office would provide the attorney general with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any necessary information.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s announcement of the investigation, which will be conducted by Eric T. Schneiderman, came hours after Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up, the star-powered organization dedicated to fighting sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond, wrote a letter to the governor calling on him to open an investigation into Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is of great concern that sexual assault cases have not been pursued with full vigor by our criminal justice system,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement also came the same day that Cynthia Nixon, an actress and education activist, announced her candidacy for governor; Ms. Nixon, a Democrat, is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the left.Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office is currently investigating other claims against Mr. Weinstein, including that he twice raped the actress Paz de la Huerta. Mr. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said the review of Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case would not interfere with those open investigations, which he said would conclude within about 45 days. Afterward, the statement said, Mr. Schneiderman would review the entire matter and decide if further action was warranted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are deeply familiar with Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s years of egregious sexual abuse, and recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against him alleging severe and persistent abuse of employees at The Weinstein Company,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are committed to pursuing a full, fair and independent review of this matter.‚<U+0080>ùReports of possible conflicts of interest between Mr. Vance and Mr. Weinstein have circulated since last October, when a deluge of accusations against Mr. Weinstein, once one of Hollywood‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful producers, sparked an international reckoning around sexual abuse. Two of the lawyers Mr. Weinstein retained after being brought in for questioning about his encounters with Ms. Battilana had personal and financial ties to Mr. Vance: Elkan Abramowitz was a former law partner of Mr. Vance and a donor to his campaign, and Daniel S. Connolly was a former prosecutor turned white-collar defense lawyer.Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers also brought on Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor and close friend of the head of the district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex crimes bureau, as a consultant; she facilitated an introduction between Mr. Abramowitz and the bureau head, Martha Bashford.And David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein who hired a private investigative firm to dig up information in an attempt to stop The New York Times‚<U+0080><U+0099>s expose on his client, has given $55,000 to Mr. Vance over the years. Mr. Boies has said he never spoke to Mr. Vance about any criminal investigation of Mr. Weinstein.In Ms. Battilana‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, Ms. Bashford determined after two weeks of investigation that she could not prove the crime of forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse had been committed, even though she had the audio tape, Mr. Vance has said. Prosecutors judged it would be hard to prove Mr. Weinstein touched Ms. Battilana for sexual reasons because the advance came as the two were talking about Ms. Battilana becoming a lingerie model and whether her bosom had been surgically enhanced.Prosecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to pursue charges, and it is not uncommon for assistant district attorneys not to see eye-to-eye with detectives on the strength of a case. But the tensions over Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision in the case have exploded in recent months into an open feud between some detectives in the Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s special victims unit and the district attorney.For detectives, assembling enough evidence to establish that it is probable someone committed a crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known in law as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>probable cause‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is enough to make an arrest. Prosecutors, however, must take things further and prove every element of the crime in court, and that can often be a much higher bar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The police have a job to do, and we have a job to do, and they are very different jobs,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Vance said in an interview Monday night. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our job is to ensure that any case that we bring has proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard we have to meet in court. Any other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes. If you are trying cases where you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have the proof, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not going to be a satisfactory outcome for the survivor.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Vance also issued a joint statement with the police commissioner, James P. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Neill, in which he called his office and the Police Department ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fully committed partners in the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>From time to time we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have our disagreements, but we will never allow them to undermine this shared endeavor,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.Since its inception a quarter century ago, the independent city agency that investigates allegations of police abuse in New York City has done nothing more with complaints about sexual misconduct than send them to the Police Department. In the 18 months ending last June, 117 such allegations were funneled to the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internal Affairs Bureau, where findings remain hidden and any discipline of officers is cloaked in administrative secrecy.Now, however, as allegations about a wide spectrum of sexual misconduct ‚<U+0080><U+0094> from inappropriate comments to workplace coercion to sexual abuse and rape ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are roiling the country, the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, has added a layer of oversight to allegations of sexual harassment and abuse in policing.In a board meeting on Wednesday it adopted  a resolution from its staff to immediately investigate certain allegations of sexual misconduct by officers against civilians, such as lewd comments or gestures, snapping unwanted photographs or sexually humiliating or ticketing civilians if they rebuff flirtations like a blown kiss. The vote was unanimous, with three board members appointed by the police commissioner joining seven others appointed by the mayor or City Council.Later, it hopes to broaden that mandate and select a group of specially trained, senior investigators to handle the most serious allegations, including rape, though not before it builds up a budget and some expertise in helping survivors of traumatic sexual violence by officers.That next phase must be done carefully, to ensure that, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the procedures we put in place do not negatively impact the complainants and also don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t impact potential criminal investigations,‚<U+0080>ù Jonathan Darche, the executive director of the board, told board members at the meeting.In a memo outlining its rationale, the staff of the agency said there is little in the arena of abuse by sworn, armed law enforcement officers that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>undermines society‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confidence in the police more than an officer who wields the badge as a tool of sexual intimidation and coercion.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unfortunately,‚<U+0080>ù it went on, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the question is not whether such misconduct occurs. Rather, C.C.R.B. must investigate how often it occurs and what can be done to stop it.‚<U+0080>ùOutside watchdogs of the New York City police immediately embraced the idea as necessary and long overdue. The C.C.R.B. was formed in 1993 with a mandate by the City Charter to investigate four types of misconduct allegations: force; abuse of authority; discourtesy; and offensive language. It said in its memo that allegations of sexual misconduct by officers fall clearly under its power to look into cases of officers abusing their authority, though some cases might also involve discourtesy, offensive language or force.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s any surprise here, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s that the C.C.R.B. is only now getting to the point where it recognizes that sexual harassment by N.Y.P.D. officers is something the board has to be dealing with,‚<U+0080>ù Christopher T. Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the board before its vote, in Lower Manhattan. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I am glad you are confronting it now.‚<U+0080>ùFor allegations of criminal sexual conduct, the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo called for a new policy allowing the board to notify the appropriate district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a step beyond its current practice of only notifying the Internal Affairs Bureau ‚<U+0080><U+0094> though it said the high burden of proof in such cases means prosecutors often cannot or will not pursue them.Andrew Case, a lawyer who was a spokesman for the review board, said he worries ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that if these cases, particularly forcible assaults, fall to C.C.R.B., then that would be a sign that D.A.s are not doing all they can to investigate truly criminal acts.‚<U+0080>ùNew York state law does not explicitly forbid sexual contact between police officers and people in their custody, though it forbids such conduct by correction and parole officers. The New York State Assembly last week passed legislation to prevent police officers from escaping legal consequences of an alleged sexual assault by saying arrestees consented, and the State Senate is now considering the same measure. The New York City Council is also considering legislation that would make it a misdemeanor crime for police officers to have sexual contact with people in custody.The 117 allegations of sexual misconduct the board referred to the Internal Affairs Bureau between January 2016 and June ‚<U+0080><U+009C>included a variety of allegations, from catcalls and sexual propositions to unwanted touching and rape,‚<U+0080>ù the memo said. It summarized three of them to provide a range of cases the board receives.In one, a woman questioned by a Bronx detective in 2014, at a shooting scene, went on to repeatedly encounter the same man around the neighborhood ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and recalled that he would regularly lick his lips and make lewd expressions toward her,‚<U+0080>ù the board‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo said. In 2016, as she was held in a station house jail cell on a driving charge, the same detective entered her cell and made a profane gesture and a reference to oral sex.In another, a man alleged that an officer twice squeezed his genitals during a frisk last year that followed a street stop for jaywalking.The Police Department declined to answer questions about any discipline handed down to officers in the 117 complaints referred to its Internal Affairs Bureau, how the cases were decided or what the complaints alleged. It said it would work with the review board to implement the new procedure.For all review board referrals to the Internal Affairs Bureau, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a huge issue‚<U+0080>ù is that the police ‚<U+0080><U+009C>don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t tell us what happens with any of them,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Case said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One of the things this speaks to, a broader issue, is reporting from I.A.B. to C.C.R.B. about all referrals.‚<U+0080>ùWASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has argued for weeks that Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate, should leave the race, said on Sunday that he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>going to let the people of Alabama make the call.‚<U+0080>ùAsked during an appearance on ABC News‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This Week‚<U+0080>ù whether he thought Mr. Moore, who has been accused of preying on teenage girls, should be in the Senate, Mr. Connell said the decision should be left to the Dec. 12 special election.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This election has been going on a long time,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. McConnell said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There has been a lot of discussion about it. They are going to make the decision a week from Tuesday.‚<U+0080>ùIn the past, Mr. McConnell had said that he was looking at drafting a write-in candidate for the election, and that if Mr. Moore, a Republican, won the race, he would support a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the allegations against him.But on Sunday, Mr. McConnell seemed to accept that Mr. Moore, who has denied the allegations, would not be stepping down with only days remaining before the vote.Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Mr. McConnell, said the senator was not backing down from any earlier comments about Mr. Moore. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The leader did not change or retract any of his previous statements,‚<U+0080>ù she said in an email on Sunday.Mr. McConnell told ABC News that he still believed that the Ethics Committee should investigate the allegations against Mr. Moore.Several women have accused Mr. Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior. They said they had been subjected to groping, forcible kissing or other unwanted advances when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor in his 30s.Mr. McConnell noted on Sunday that two decades ago, when he was the chairman of the Ethics Committee, he had recommended the expulsion of Senator Bob Packwood, the powerful Oregon Republican, who resigned in 1995 after he was accused of sexual harassment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Senate has been very sensitive to these matters for a long time, and the Senate Ethics Committee will handle this in the regular order way that we do this in the Senate,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m confident they will come up with the right conclusion.‚<U+0080>ùA prominent donor to the Democratic Party says she is considering withdrawing support for senators who urged their colleague Al Franken to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct.The donor, Susie Tompkins Buell, has been one of the Democratic Party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most generous supporters for decades. In particular, she has been a champion of female politicians, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Maria Cantwell of Washington.Last month, those senators were among the dozens who called for Mr. Franken to resign from the Senate after at least six women accused him of sexual harassment or misconduct, such as forcible kissing and groping.Mr. Franken announced his resignation on Dec. 7 before the Senate Ethics Committee had completed a review of the accusations, which he disputed.Before he was elected to the Senate to represent Minnesota in 2008, Mr. Franken, a Democrat, was a well-known comedian and a cast member on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saturday Night Live.‚<U+0080>ù After he resigned, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith of Minnesota was named as his replacement.Ms. Buell said in a text message on Saturday that withdrawing support from the senators who called for his resignation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an option‚<U+0080>ù she was considering.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In my gut they moved too fast,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote, adding that Mr. Franken ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was never given his chance to tell his side of the story.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>For me this is dangerous and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am a big believer in helping more women into the political system but this has given me an opportunity to rethink of how I can best help my party.‚<U+0080>ùShe is a friend of Hillary Clinton‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and has spoken in support of Ms. Gillibrand, who led the charge in the Senate to urge Mr. Franken to leave.In her text, Ms. Buell said she did not know Mr. Franken personally but had met him a couple of times and was impressed by his work as a senator.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As for Gillibrand, unfortunately, I believe she miscalculated and has shot herself in the foot,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have supported her for many years. Will I going forward? To be determined.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Buell, of San Francisco, was a founder of the clothing brand Esprit and has spent decades fund-raising and donating millions of dollars for liberal causes and candidates. Her Susie Tompkins Buell Foundation has awarded grants to organizations supporting climate change education, a free press and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights.In 2016, Ms. Buell contributed money to help a woman who had accused President Trump of harassment, she said, adding that the money was not used and was refunded. The New York Times reported last month that she was said to have donated $500,000 to support accusers, but Ms. Buell would not confirm the amount.Her comments about the senators who called for Mr. Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resignation were reported by BuzzFeed.A spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand did not respond directly to Ms. Buell but pointed to the senator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook post on Dec. 6, in which she urged Mr. Franken to resign.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have to rise to the occasion, and not shrink away from it, even when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard, especially when it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard,‚<U+0080>ù it said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is what this larger moment is about. So, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on Senator Franken‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. Enough is enough. The women who have come forward are brave and I believe them.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Gillibrand added that the allegations against Mr. Franken were not equal to the harassment and assault accusations against the Hollywood filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, the Alabama politician Roy S. Moore and Mr. Trump. She has called for Mr. Trump to resign. In response, he wrote in a tweet that she was a lightweight ‚<U+0080><U+009C>who would come to my office ‚<U+0080><U+0098>begging‚<U+0080><U+0099> for campaign contributions not so long ago.‚<U+0080>ùThis past week, for the second time in just a few days, protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to voice their objections to the continued employment of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who is running unopposed for re-election as Manhattan district attorney. Announced with the hashtag #ByeCy, Thursday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rally advanced the argument that his tenure has been marked by service to the wealthy and powerful, who are spared his scrutinies, and the aggressive pursuit of the poor, who are routinely victimized by them.Reports of Harvey Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s serial predations had highlighted Mr. Vance‚<U+0080><U+0099>s refusal to charge the movie executive for groping a young woman, Ambra Battilana, during a meeting two years ago. Offering justification, prosecutors claimed that they worried they would not be able to prove that Mr. Weinstein grabbed the woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast for the purpose of sexual satisfaction, which is like saying that it would be hard to determine whether someone who removed a mop from a broom closet, dipped it in a bucket of Murphy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oil Soap and aimed it toward the floor was really intending to do some cleaning.Although the police had captured Mr. Weinstein admitting to the assault on tape, prosecutors wedded themselves to the preposterous notion that there might have been an entirely legitimate reason for a man, in his 60s, to grab the intimate extremities of a 22-year-old woman who had not invited his anatomical inspection. Mr. Weinstein, whose r√©sum√© does not include the title ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chief of marketing at Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Secret,‚<U+0080>ù was ostensibly getting together with Ms. Battilana to talk about her aspirations to become a lingerie model. This was a business proposition and so it was only logical to conclude that he had touched her breasts out of necessity rather than deviance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to see if they were real or the product of surgical oomph, as if now, all of a sudden, cosmetic alteration had become a dubious prospect in the world of undergarment promotion.The lunacy and bias of the prosecutorial position reflect the sexism embedded in the language around the sex-crimes statute itself. In New York and other states, including California, certain acts of sexual abuse and battery are punishable only if it can be shown that they were committed to gratify the sexual desire of the actor (or to degrade or humiliate the victim). The prosecutor must essentially assume the burden of proving what was in the predator‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mind, and while the motive is self-evident in many, many instances, the law allows broad opportunity for questionable lines of defense along those Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers would presumably have waged. Suppose a textile designer grabbed a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s breast in the subway. He could argue, theoretically, that as someone interested in materials, he was merely trying to figure out whether the particular bit of flesh felt more like a tennis ball or a foam roller, and potentially suffer no consequences.Mr. Weinstein could have been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>forcible touching,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> a statute in the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s penal code that includes the sexual gratification clause and remains troubling for other reasons as well. As Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor who is the director of advocacy for the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women asked, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is the term ‚<U+0080><U+0098>forcible‚<U+0080><U+0099> doing in there?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> If someone lunges at your breast while you are looking at your phone, there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>force.‚<U+0080>ù A more progressive law would simply forbid unsolicited touching.The forcible touching law came about as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act in 2001, after feminists had agitated for a strengthening of the charge of third-degree sex abuse ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which also pertained in Mr. Weinstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case. Third-degree sex abuse was meant to deal with groping, but it did so inadequately. It was, and remains, a Class B misdemeanor, which puts it on par with soliciting money for fortune telling. The forcible touching statute was meant as a compromise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> forcible touching is a Class A misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in prison. But as Ms. Manning pointed out, sentences of that kind are rarely administered. Beyond that, the sexual gratification stipulation was attached, however inexplicably, angering activists. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the gratification premise is there and it keeps prosecutors from prosecuting people like Harvey,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0099> Ms. Manning said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it has to change.‚<U+0080>ùLandmark legislation around sex crimes was unlikely to have taken shape in the New York State Legislature at the start of the millennium. For years, mostly male lawmakers and those in their orbit clung to a secret agreement known as the Bear Mountain compact, in which affairs and assignations with young staff members and interns occurring north of the Bear Mountain Bridge weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t talked about in New York City and other home districts.In June 2003, J. Michael Boxley, who served as the right hand to the eventually disgraced Democratic assembly speaker Sheldon Silver, was charged with raping a 22-year-old staff member after a night of drinking. This was two years after another female aide accused Mr. Boxley of sexually assaulting her in his apartment. That investigation, conducted by the Assembly rather than by the police, was eventually closed with Mr. Boxley denying the accusations. He pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the second instance, but did not go to prison. His law license was suspended temporarily. Since 2011 he has been working for the Albany law firm of Brown & Weinraub, a legal and consulting outfit. Mr. Boxley had no hand in the sex reform legislation, but when I asked David Weinraub, one of the name partners, how he came to be hired, he said that he had known Mr. Boxley for 30 years.While we would like to think that, more than a decade later, the climate in which these laws governing women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies are written has changed, there remains way too much evidence to the contrary. Just this week, female legislators and others involved in state government in Sacramento signed a letter calling out a culture of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pervasive‚<U+0080>ù sexual harassment in the California capital. Any assumption that female political leaders in such a liberal place were exempt, the letter said, was wrong.Steven Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new movie, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Crown‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life with quick, grim strokes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ostensibly because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a suicide risk ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s who and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t belong in the hospital but doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help her case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Carrie‚<U+0080>ù) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Shining,‚<U+0080>ù another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich√©s and sadism and just read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crickets‚<U+0080>ù is slang for critics, but maybe the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.BOSTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A state senator's husband was indicted Thursday on charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos without consent and criminal lewdness.The indictment of Bryon Hefner, the husband of Democratic Sen. Stanley Rosenberg, came months after The Boston Globe reported on allegations that Hefner sexually harassed or abused several men, some of whom had business before the Legislature.Prosecutors said Hefner sexually assaulted three victims between 2014 and 2016. They said he also obtained nude and partially nude photos of another victim without that victim's knowledge and sent or showed the photos to other people.""Today's indictments on multiple felony charges send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,"" Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. ""I want to thank the victims who have come forward and put their trust in us.""Hefner's attorney said he ""intends to plead not guilty and looks forward to contesting the evidence and confronting the witnesses against him in a court of law.""Hefner is set to be arraigned on April 24 in Suffolk Superior Court, prosecutors said.Rosenberg, who is separated from Hefner, said these are ""serious charges.""""They are now being handled by the judicial system,"" he said in a statement. ""I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.""Rosenberg, who's in his late 60s, announced in January that he had separated from Hefner, who's 30, and that Hefner had entered treatment for alcohol dependency.Democratic state Senate President Harriette Chandler, who replaced Rosenberg as president, called the charges ""deeply disturbing.""""Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the District Attorney and Attorney General's Office,"" she said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, both Republicans, said they ""commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.""The initial reports that several men had accused Hefner of sexual assault or harassment sent the chamber into turmoil late last year, resulting in Rosenberg's decision to step down.The Senate Ethics Committee voted to hire a Boston law firm to independently investigate whether Rosenberg violated any Senate rules in connection with the allegations. That probe is ongoing.Rosenberg, a state senator since 1991, had initially hoped to return as president once the investigation was completed, but pressure mounted on senators to move on after the Globe subsequently reported that Hefner had involved himself in matters before the Senate. That included having access to Rosenberg's email account, despite Rosenberg's earlier promise to keep a ""firewall"" between his professional and personal lives.A lawyer for Hefner said at the time that Hefner ""did not have independent access to his husband's official email.""Rosenberg has repeatedly said that Hefner did not influence his actions and decisions as Senate president.Rosenberg assumed the top leadership post in January 2015. He was the first openly gay leader of either legislative chamber in Massachusetts.Democratic state Sen. Karen Spilka last week announced that she had secured commitments from enough of her colleagues to become the next Senate president, essentially ending any hope of Rosenberg's return as president. Rosenberg continues to serve as senator.When Chandler, who's 80, took over after Rosenberg's decision to step down, she said she intended to serve as president only through the remainder of this year.___Associated Press writers Bob Salsberg and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.OKLAHOMA CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed Wednesday that it is looking into a lawsuit's allegations that a middle school student was sexually assaulted and threatened by classmates over 18 months and that school officials did nothing to stop the attacks.The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Oklahoma City by the now 14-year-old boy and his parents, alleges that Superintendent A.J. Brewer and Principal Stuart McPherson of Washington Public Schools, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City treated the assaults as ""horseplay"" or ""accidental touching.""The OSBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations should be finished soon, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.""We should have our reports completed in a few weeks. We will then hand it over to the district attorney. The DA will then determine how to proceed,"" and whether criminal charges are warranted, Brown said.School attorney Andy Fugitt said Wednesday that he was aware of the lawsuit but that he could not comment on pending litigation.Under Oklahoma law, anyone who suspects a child under the age of 18 is being abused is required to report the suspicion to the state's Department of Human Services.According to the lawsuit, DHS was notified of the allegations in May 2017, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation began investigating in November at the request of the Washington Police Department.DHS spokeswoman Sheree Powell said the agency is prohibited by state and federal law from confirming any investigation.""We don't or confirm investigations involving particular allegations or individuals,"" Powell said.The lawsuit comes after four former football players in the Tulsa suburb of Bixby were previously charged with sexually assaulting a teammate that prosecutors said wasn't promptly reported.The four have pleaded not guilty and their attorneys have asked that the each be certified as juveniles.An Associated Press investigation published in 2017 examined sexual violence in school sports as part of a larger look at student-on-student sex assaults. The investigation found that team sexual assault is often mischaracterized as hazing and bullying and that the violence is so normalized that it persists for years, as players attacked one season become aggressors the next.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The British actress Minnie Driver, who recently resigned from her role as an Oxfam ambassador after revelations of sexual misconduct by staff members at the charity, said on Tuesday that the conversation around sexual assault should be based on a model similar to a truth and reconciliation commission to heal wounds and move forward.Ms. Driver, known for her roles in movies like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù was speaking at a London event focused on the #MeToo movement and organized by The New York Times and the How To Academy. Here are highlights of the interview.She spoke at length about comments made by Matt Damon, a former boyfriend, who said that alleged sexual misdeeds by powerful men involved a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>spectrum of behavior.‚<U+0080>ù Speaking on ABC News in December, Mr. Damon had said there was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be conflated.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver said that Mr. Damon ‚<U+0080><U+009C>represented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, she said men needed to be included in the conversation about sexual assault because ‚<U+0080><U+009C>there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no way to move forward unless we do this together.‚<U+0080>ù Use the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>model of truth and reconciliation,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to courtlike commissions set up after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda or apartheid in South Africa, where the judicial bodies were tasked with revealing wrongdoing in hopes of healing wounds.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Women get to be heard,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to metabolize that and then there is due process and then there is healing.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, the deputy chief executive of Oxfam resigned in the wake of accusations that the British charity had covered up misconduct by its staff members after revelations that aid workers had hired prostitutes in crisis zones in Chad and Haiti.Ms. Driver, who was affiliated with the organization for 20 years ‚<U+0080><U+0094> her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>longest relationship with anyone,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> announced last week that she was resigning from her role as a celebrity ambassador. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It broke my heart in so many ways,‚<U+0080>ù she said, particularly because she had been primarily involved in programs that were helping prostitutes in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam to retrain and rebuild their lives. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It cut me to the very heart of what I had been involved with,‚<U+0080>ù she said.She added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I needed to send a very clear message, not to the beautiful people that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked with on the ground for so many years who are amazing and industrious, but to the corporation that knew, corporate people who knew this was going on. Who hush-hushed it. Who were not transparent about it, either with me or the people that worked for them, and who didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything about it.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Driver recounted her experience with Mr. Weinstein, the disgraced mogul who produced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good Will Hunting,‚<U+0080>ù in which she plays an erudite Harvard graduate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to cast me,‚<U+0080>ù she said, because he told her and the casting director that she was not attractive enough to have sex with. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got off lightly with him. I really did,‚<U+0080>ù she added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we talk about sexual harassment, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not about sex, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s about power.‚<U+0080>ùThe inhabitants of the derelict mansion in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lodgers‚<U+0080>ù don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get out much. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s script, the director Brian O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins‚<U+0080><U+0099> birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a measure of this movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insistently fright-free storytelling that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Edward. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dracula,‚<U+0080>ù as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers.Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>chilling effect‚<U+0080>ù on campus sexual assault investigations.Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them.In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus.A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation.Under Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations.Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases.The Obama-era guidance, issued in 2011 and 2014, reinforced the obligation of colleges and universities to respond to sexual assault claims and was widely hailed as strengthening protections for accusers amid increasing evidence that those institutions were skirting their responsibilities to investigate sexual misconduct. But it was widely assailed by men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rights and conservative civil liberties groups as heavily biased against the accused.In an extensive policy speech announcing the new guidance, Ms. DeVos outlined what she described as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>failed system‚<U+0080>ù that violated students‚<U+0080><U+0099> due process rights and lacked public confidence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. DeVos said in September. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.‚<U+0080>ùMs. DeVos issued interim guidance that raised the standard of proof for accusers to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>clear and convincing evidence‚<U+0080>ù from a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>preponderance of evidence‚<U+0080>ù and allowed cases to be settled in mediation sessions between the accuser and the accused. It also dropped time frames for completing investigations.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new policy discriminates against women and girls and makes it harder for them to learn in a safe environment,‚<U+0080>ù said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center, which is representing the litigants in the suit.The plaintiffs in the suit, Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice and the Victim Rights Law Center, all advise or represent people who say they were sexually assaulted. The groups are being represented by Equal Rights Advocates, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Center for Youth Law and the National Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Law Center.In the complaint, SurvJustice said that the group had not only seen ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a decrease in the number of sexual violence survivors seeking its services,‚<U+0080>ù but also observed a trend in educational institutions not responding at all, or not responding as promptly to its clients‚<U+0080><U+0099> complaints.The group also wrote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>students who have questioned whether they should continue with their plans to report sexual violence given the uncertainty regarding their legal protections and an anticipated lowered likelihood of success created by the policy change.‚<U+0080>ùThe Victims Rights Law Center, which focuses its efforts on rape and sexual assault, said Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s guidance was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>devastating‚<U+0080>ù to its mission and operational activities.The groups are asking that the guidance be rescinded as unlawful.‚<U+0080><U+009C>With each day that passes, this discriminatory policy will continue to cause harm to survivors of sexual harassment and violence,‚<U+0080>ù said Alice Y. Abrokwa, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law.In their complaint, the groups wrote that Ms. DeVos and her acting leader of civil rights, Candice Jackson, made statements that revealed their bias against accusers.They cited Ms. DeVos‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy address during which she asserted that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>if everything is harassment, then nothing is,‚<U+0080>ù and Ms. Jackson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dismissal of women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fake victims.‚<U+0080>ùSAN ANTONIO ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  In October of 2016, not long after a sexual assault scandal at Baylor swept out the football coach, athletic director and president of the university, the NCAA convened a commission to combat campus sexual violence.The commission crafted a policy focused on educating athletes and coaches and ensuring athletic departments were following school policies regarding the handling of sexual assault allegations. The commission's proposal was adopted by the NCAA board of governors last year .Since then, Michigan State has become embroiled in a horrific scandal involving a former athletic department doctor, Larry Nassar, who has been convicted of molesting dozens of women, including many Spartans athletes.NCAA leaders see the association as an agent of culture change, trying to curb a problem that goes beyond athletics. Others want the NCAA to take a more active role, putting rules in place that would ban individual offenders from competing in college athletics and sanction schools that fail to weed out potential predators. That is highly unlikely.""This is a systemic issue in society and certainly on campuses regardless of whether it's student-athletes or not,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday at the Alamodome, site of Saturday's Final Four. ""On that score, the NCAA and the Board of Governors in particular have been more engaged than any other higher education entity. In fact, we're providing leadership to the rest of higher ed right now on trying to figure out how to deal with these issues in advance and prevent them, rather than just always coming in after the fact and imposing some kind of punishment or solutions afterwards.""Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor and activist who speaks to college sports teams all over the country, is part of the NCAA's commission to combat campus sexual assault. Tracy was encouraged by the passing of the commission's recommendations by NCAA Board of Governors in August . But she is pushing for an NCAA ban on athletes who commit sexual violence.""I don't feel like anyone should be banned from their education,"" Tracy said. ""But I do think that playing sports is absolutely a privilege and not a right. It's a privilege to be an NCAA athlete. To be a scholarship athlete.""Tracy said because of the prestige that goes with being an athlete, especially in high-profile sports such as football and basketball, they have more influence on campus.""And so we have a duty and a responsibility to make sure we're driving conversations that effect attitudes and beliefs and how we view these issues correctly,"" she said. ""And we're not. We're basically saying if you can run fast enough and throw a ball and make enough money for a school or a sports program then you can do whatever you want. You can break a woman's face. You can stomp her. You can rape her. You can do whatever you want as long as you're a good enough athlete. And that's wrong.""And so I also talk to them about, you know, what about attaching eligibility to behavior. You attach it to grades. Why can't we say sexual assault is not OK. Domestic violence is not OK.""For the NCAA, stepping into the area of what it refers to as individual accountability is complicated territory.""You quickly recognize that there are other entities that hold individuals accountable for criminal acts per se or even for violations of Title IX on specific campuses when investigations are completed,"" NCAA chief legal officer Don Remy said. ""And so as we have looked at this we have looked at our role as composed of all of higher education. And how can we in college athletics be part of the higher education dialogue to change the culture. And how can we make sure that student-athletes are treated the same as students who are on campus who don't compete in athletics. Not to create any preferential treatment for student-athletes or to create a negative environment for student-athletes, but to have student-athletes be able to matriculate through their time on campus like other students who aren't competing in athletics.""Kathy Redmond, founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, said at the heart of the problem is athletes are often given preferential treatment and protection by athletic programs, boosters and even local enforcement when they are accused of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. Redmond called the sexual violence policy the NCAA passed last year a ""check-the-box"" measure.""But when it comes down to it, the individual players know that the system will work for them,"" she said.Redmond said the NCAA should use a proposal crafted by the Drake Group , a watchdog for college sports, to guide policy on sexual violence committed by athletes.Tracy would like the NCAA to adopt a policy similar to the one Indiana University implemented last year, which bans its teams from accepting any athletes with a documented history of sexual or domestic violence. IU's policy was inspired by a similar one implemented by the Southeastern Conference regarding transfers.Though Indiana athletic director Fred Glass said: ""We didn't implement it to be like a trailblazer or pulling people toward this policy.""Laws differ from state to state, down to definitions of sexual assault. A one-size fits all NCAA policy that bans athletes with past transgressions would be difficult to craft and possibly vulnerable to legal challenges.""What is that a life sentence?"" said Cleveland-based attorney Susan Stone, who represented Ma'Lik Richmond, the Youngstown State football player convicted of rape in juvenile court when he was in high school.Campus backlash prompted Youngstown State to ban Richmond from playing last season. He sued the school, which had no policy like Indiana's. The school settled and lifted the ban.""There needs to be some thought before you ostracize students,"" Stone said.Tracy said she is not just looking to punish wrongdoers.""We're not just failing survivors, but we're also failing these young men, too,"" she said. ""Especially with our athletes the way we place entitlement on them from a young age. The way we set them up for failure by protecting them from everything. All this stuff that we do with our athletes, we're not helping them.""___Follow Ralph D.

The once-beloved comedian and television star has been accused by more than 50 women of sexual assault going back decades.Only one of those accusations was recent enough to prosecute. Cosby, 80, is charged with drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, 44, at his home near Philadelphia between Dec. 30, 2003, and Jan. 20, 2004. Jury selection is due to start on Monday.Cosby, best known as the wise and witty dad in the 1980s TV hit ""The Cosby Show,"" has denied criminal wrongdoing, saying any sexual contact he had was consensual.Cosby's first trial ended in June with a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict following six days of deliberations.Cosby, who now walks with a cane and has poor vision, sat at the defense table on Thursday for the first of two days of pre-trial arguments, with the defense and prosecution clashing over what witnesses and evidence the jury should be allowed to see.Cosby's defense team sought the judge's recusal because his wife, Dr. Deborah O'Neill, is a psychotherapist at Penn who coordinates a group that helps sexual assault victims. She made a $100 donation to a feminist group at the University of Pennsylvania sponsoring the annual V-Day activities, which include a production of the play ""The Vagina Monologues.""O'Neill dismissed the request, saying, ""She's an independent woman and has a right to be involved in anything she believes in.""Prosecutors want to quash any mention of a 2005 press release in which former District Attorney Bruce Castor announced that he would not prosecute Cosby, and of how current District Attorney Kevin Steele later decided to file charges.Defense lawyers want the jury to hear from Margo Jackson, who they say will testify that she heard Constand say she could make money on a sexual assault accusation against a celebrity.In the first trial, O'Neill ruled Jackson's testimony was inadmissible as hearsay but now he is reconsidering.The pre-trial hearing was due to resume on Friday morning.Jury selection is to begin on Monday, with the jury pool being sequestered starting on Sunday night, O'Neill said.(Reporting by David DeKok Writing by Daniel Trotta Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bill Trott)A star University of Minnesota basketball player announced Thursday that he would not appeal a university ruling expelling him for sexual assault, effectively ending his college career.The university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action had found Reggie Lynch, 23, a senior, responsible for violating the university code over two incidents. In one case, the sentence was suspension; in the second, expulsion.Lynch played with the Gophers during investigations into the incidents, which dated back more than a year, but he was suspended from play last month when the first decision was made public.At a news conference on Thursday, Lynch insisted upon his innocence and blamed a national atmosphere that is unfair to those accused of sexual misdeeds for his downfall. In recent months, accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men have stirred new interest in combating such behavior.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, people will automatically assume that you are guilty if any accusations have been made,‚<U+0080>ù Lynch said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I feel scared that in today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s climate, this is the world we live in today. I am angry that there is no real way to defend myself.‚<U+0080>ùA university spokesman confirmed Lynch was no longer an active student.Lynch was previously suspended from the team over the summer of 2016, after he was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a third woman. In that case, prosecutors did not charge him and a university investigation cleared him of responsibility.A center, Lynch was a standout for the Gophers last season, his junior year, winning the Big Ten‚<U+0080><U+0099>s defensive player of the year honors as Minnesota went 24-10 and made the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time under Coach Richard Pitino.This season, the Gophers are 14-14. Lynch had not played since Jan. 3.Lynch‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother, Marlene, who appeared alongside her son and his lawyer on Thursday, specifically blamed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the current political climate at the U‚<U+0080>ù for what she characterized as an injustice done to her son.In late 2016, Minnesota football players threatened to boycott a bowl game to protest the suspensions of several teammates for their alleged involvement in a sexual assault. That brought national attention to the university, prompting the president, Eric W. Kaler, to vow a renewed initiative to combat sexual assault.Some sexual encounters are obviously consensual, while others are obviously not. But what about those that are neither black nor white? In the second episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars plunge deeper into the gray area.A woman who calls herself ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stuck in the Gray‚<U+0080>ù is still haunted by her first sexual encounter over a decade later. At age 22, she lost her virginity to her brother-in-law, who is 11 years her senior. The encounter had lasting repercussions on her sex life and her relationship with her family, especially her sister, her brother-in-law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife. Stuck in the Gray struggled to define the encounter for years and now she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unable to conclude if it was consensual. She asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I a coward and a liar who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hiding my accountability behind victimization?

He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an enemy of the state, a man of God and the great hero of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Power and the Glory.‚<U+0080>ù Father Frank Docherty, the protagonist of Thomas Keneally‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new novel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crimes of the Father,‚<U+0080>ù is a bad priest to some and a good one to others, and he certainly knows it. Sent away from his native Sydney in 1972 by an archbishop who found Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political activism and theological liberalism unacceptable, he is by the 1990s a psychologist and a professor in Canada. Under those auspices, he researches the sexual abuse of children and minors by the clergy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew the suspicion he attracted from his brethren in the wider priesthood. He was a priest who ponced around academia all week, dealing with unhealthy and distasteful subjects, and helped out at a local parish on the weekend ‚<U+0080><U+0094> how graceful of him!‚<U+0080>ùFor his 36th novel, Keneally has chosen a subject that is by now painfully familiar to both Roman Catholics and the wider public. The main action takes place in Sydney in 1996 and concerns the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding Irish population. This is a time and place and community in which those abused are just beginning to come forward more boldly, while church leaders and the faithful more broadly are themselves only just starting to reckon more openly with longstanding patterns of institutional failure, corruption and concealment. As he returns to Sydney to lecture on his research, resume complicated friendships and seek permission from the current archbishop to celebrate Mass again in his native archdiocese, Docherty becomes involved in an intertwined series of private and public revelations.For obvious reasons, Keneally admires his protagonist. As such, Docherty is not especially interesting, for he rarely seems genuinely unsure of himself. Whether he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preparing to confront an elite clergyman and his superior with evidence of the clergyman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse or trying to deal with once strong, now reheated feelings for a married woman, his struggles come across as stylized, even romantically heroic. You can be damned sure, mate, that tough-and-tender ol‚<U+0080><U+0099> Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to do the difficult thing, and do it well, no matter the odds.The novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far more distinctive and well-wrought character is Sarah Fagan, the Sydney cabdriver who picks up Docherty at the airport upon his return. Through intensely told flashback sequences, Keneally brings out the confusion and pain teenage Sarah experiences when she comes under the influence of Father Leo Shannon, a rising young star in the archdiocese. Under the guise of hiring her as his office assistant, Shannon makes Fagan feel privileged, even blessed, to spend secret time doing secret things with him. When he coolly rejects her for other girls, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she felt the jolt of this news, and a sickening bewilderment in the pit of her stomach; the extreme sentiments of the rejected.‚<U+0080>ùFrom this brilliant, brutal rendering of Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victimization, Keneally traces out her jagged trajectory through a convent childhood, university studies, a teaching career and assorted vocational and spiritual spinouts, and finally into her very tentative alliance with Docherty. This last happens to coincide with Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confrontation with Shannon himself, now a key adviser to the archbishop in legal proceedings concerning another abuse case. The heroism and villainy that play out thereafter is suspenseful, if predictable. Far more powerfully felt is Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unexpected expression of thanks to Docherty, near the novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end, for a favor he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done her, which has made possible both personal renewal and public justice. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What favor is that?‚<U+0080>ù the priest asks. Her answer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You believed me.‚<U+0080>ùJust one day after Hollywood offered a show of support for the #MeToo movement on the Golden Globes red carpet and stage, a famous actress on the other side of the Atlantic lent her name to a public letter denouncing the movement, as well as its French counterpart, #Balancetonporc, or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Expose Your Pig.‚<U+0080>ùCatherine Deneuve joined more than 100 other Frenchwomen in entertainment, publishing and academic fields Tuesday in the pages of the newspaper Le Monde and on its website in arguing that the two movements, in which women and men have used social media as a forum to describe sexual misconduct, have gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and have created a totalitarian climate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is a crime. But insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression,‚<U+0080>ù the letter, dated Monday, begins. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As a result of the Weinstein affair, there has been a legitimate realization of the sexual violence women experience, particularly in the workplace, where some men abuse their power. It was necessary. But now this liberation of speech has been turned on its head.‚<U+0080>ùThey contend that the #MeToo movement has led to a campaign of public accusations that have placed undeserving people in the same category as sex offenders without giving them a chance to defend themselves. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This expedited justice already has its victims, men prevented from practicing their profession as punishment, forced to resign, etc., while the only thing they did wrong was touching a knee, trying to steal a kiss, or speaking about ‚<U+0080><U+0098>intimate‚<U+0080><U+0099> things at a work dinner, or sending messages with sexual connotations to a woman whose feelings were not mutual,‚<U+0080>ù they write. The letter, written in French was translated here by The New York Times.The passage appears to refer to the some of the names on a growing list of men who have been suspended, fired or forced to resign after having been accused of sexual misconduct in the last several months.One of the arguments the writers make is that instead of empowering women, the #MeToo and #BalanceTonPorc movements instead serve the interests of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the enemies of sexual freedom, of religious extremists, of the worst reactionaries,‚<U+0080>ù and of those who believe that women are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0098>separate‚<U+0080><U+0099> beings, children with the appearance of adults, demanding to be protected.‚<U+0080>ù They write that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman can, in the same day, lead a professional team and enjoy being the sexual object of a man, without being a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>promiscuous woman,‚<U+0080><U+0099> nor a vile accomplice of patriarchy.‚<U+0080>ùThey believe that the scope of the two movements represses sexual expression and freedom. After describing requests from publishers to make male characters ‚<U+0080><U+009C>less sexist‚<U+0080>ù and a Swedish bill that will require people to give explicit consent before engaging in sexual activity, the women write, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One more effort and two adults who will want to sleep together will first check, through an app on their phone, a document in which the practices they accept and those they refuse will be duly listed.‚<U+0080>ùThey continue, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The philosopher Ruwen Ogien defended the freedom to offend as essential to artistic creation. In the same way, we defend a freedom to bother, indispensable to sexual freedom.‚<U+0080>ù Though the writers do not draw clear lines between what constitutes sexual misconduct and what does not, they say that they are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sufficiently farseeing not to confuse a clumsy come-on and sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ùTranslations of the letter were quickly picked up by Twitter on Tuesday, and responses ranged from supportive to hostile. Asia Argento, an actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the Frenchwomen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter on Twitter.On the other side of the spectrum, Christina Hoff Sommers, who coined the term ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victim feminism,‚<U+0080>ù tweeted a quote from the letter and her remarks on it.In France, tens of thousands of stories have landed on social media under the hashtag #Balancetonporc since the journalist Sandra Muller used it in October in a post on Twitter about an inappropriate come-on she received from a French executive.The multitude of revelations in France has led to discussion of legislative proposals that would fine men for aggressive catcalling or lecherous behavior toward women in public, and lengthen the statute of limitations for cases involving minors. Marl√®ne Schiappa, France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s junior minister for gender equality, said that France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parliament would also debate whether to establish a clear age below which a minor cannot consent to a sexual relationship. The decision came after French prosecutors declined to charge a 28-year-old man with rape after he had sex with an 11-year-old girl.In March, Ms. Deneuve defended Roman Polanski, the director who pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl and who was accused by two other women of forcing himself on them when they were under age. While appearing on a French television channel, Ms. Deneuve said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been dealt with, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been judged. There have been agreements between Roman Polanski and this woman.‚<U+0080>ùIn concluding the letter, the writers return to the concept of self-victimization and a call for women to accept the pitfalls that come with freedom. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Accidents that can affect a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s body do not necessarily affect her dignity and must not, as hard as they can be, necessarily make her a perpetual victim,‚<U+0080>ù they write. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Because we are not reducible to our bodies. Our inner freedom is inviolable. And this freedom that we cherish is not without risks and responsibilities.‚<U+0080>ùIf you were dream-casting the role of Golden Globes host for the season of #MeToo and #TimesUp, with black-clad attendees from TV series and films that confronted misogyny (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Handmaid‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Tale‚<U+0080>ù) and racism (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Get Out‚<U+0080>ù) and a barnburner of a speech by a black female icon, you might not have picked the straight white guy.Nor, apparently, would the straight white guy. From his opening line, Seth Meyers hung a light on the dissonance of a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s being the master of this ceremony: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.‚<U+0080>ù Hosts of future awards shows, he said, were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>watching me tonight like the first dog they shot into outer space.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers borrowed a bit from his late-night talk show, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jokes Seth Can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t Tell,‚<U+0080>ù in which Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel deliver comedy that would sound strange coming from him. Here, he set up a gag for stars including Jessica Chastain (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Golden Globes turned 75 this year ‚<U+0080>¶ ‚<U+0080>ù), who sold the punch line (‚<U+0080><U+009C> ‚<U+0080>¶ but the actress that plays its wife is still only 32‚<U+0080>ù).Irony is Mr. Meyers‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thing, and he was deftly funny pointing it out. But the fact remains that the change in the air at the Globes is a recent and hardly complete process.On the one hand, the speeches from the podium were often sharply conscious ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not just the acceptances. Natalie Portman, presenting the best director award for film, announced, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Here are the all-male nominees.‚<U+0080>ùAnd Oprah Winfrey, accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, took the audience to church with a fervent, personal speech dedicated to abused women inside and outside Hollywood. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But their time is up.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers wisecracked in his monologue about the notion that Ms. Winfrey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has played down her political ambitions before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might run for president. By the end of her speech, it sounded a tiny bit less like a joke.Still, for all the consensus from the stage, the Globes still celebrated the power players of a system in which Harvey Weinstein, whose abuses precipitated the current moment, was active just a year ago. And at the awards, by and large, the men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> half of any gender dynamic in Hollywood or elsewhere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> let their ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up‚<U+0080>ù pins do the talking.Awards celebration has mingled with dissent before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like at last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Globes, just before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. (He still took a few digs this year.)It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something else for the usually frothy Globes to be held at a moment when the industry, or at least a portion of it, is dissenting against itself.The unsteady balance was apparent from the first footsteps on the red carpet. There were fewer questions about who the stars were wearing, and more about why. (Again, the women fielded a lot more of those questions than the men.)But there was dissonance, too, in an awards-media system not usually equipped to handle matters weightier than a champagne bubble. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Let me just tell you, our coverage is woke!‚<U+0080>ù said the E! correspondent Justin Sylvester, by way of introducing the 360-degree camera at the celebrity arrival area.When woke met woke, it was sometimes a rude awakening. On the E! red-carpet special, Debra Messing called out the network for its treatment of its former news host Catt Sadler, who said she left E! because of a gender pay gap. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Messing said.For much of the night, though, it was a surprisingly ordinary Golden Globes. It wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t quite a celebration; it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely a protest. (Even the black color scheme ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a visual statement for the women, less so for the ordinarily tux-clad men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> conveyed the feeling of a half-demonstration.) The Golden Globes always pitches itself as a televised party, but what kind?Maybe, as the color scheme suggested, the awards were meant to be a wake for a system of victimization. But it will be a good number of awards cycles, after the black outfits are put away, before we know if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite dead.Utah‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief law enforcement officer was deep in the fight against opioids when he realized that a lack of data on internet sales of fentanyl was hindering investigations. So the officer, Keith D. Squires, the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public safety commissioner, created a team of analysts to track and chronicle online distribution patterns of the drug.In Philadelphia, hidebound ways of confronting iPhone thefts let thrive illicit networks to distribute stolen cellphones. Detectives treated each robbery as an unrelated street crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>apple picking‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> rather than a vast scheme with connected channels used by thieves to sell the stolen phones.And in Nashville, investigators had no meaningful statistics on a nasty new swindle of the digital age: the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheating husband‚<U+0080>ù email scheme. In it, anonymous extortionists mass-email large numbers of men, threatening to unmask their infidelities. The extortionists have no idea if the men have done anything wrong, but enough of them are guilty, it turns out, that some pay up, sometimes with Bitcoin.Each case demonstrates how the tools used to fight crime and measure crime trends in the United States are outdated. Even as certain kinds of crimes are declining, others are increasing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> yet because so many occur online and have no geographic borders, local police departments face new challenges not only fighting them, but also keeping track of them. Politicians often promote crime declines without acknowledging the rise of new cybercrimes.Detectives only learned of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheating husband‚<U+0080>ù scheme from faithful spouses who were not victims. The crime did not fit into any existing category, and since the police had made no arrests, they had no statistics to feed to a national crime database in Washington that can prepare other jurisdictions for the scheme.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Suspects take advantage, knowing that ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Hey, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m basically committing crimes blindly,‚<U+0080><U+0099> without the fear of prosecution,‚<U+0080>ù said Capt. Jason M. Reinbold, commander of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigations division. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t analyze something if I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have data.‚<U+0080>ùMany of the offenses are not even counted when major crimes around the nation are tallied. Among them: identity theft; sexual exploitation; ransomware attacks; fentanyl purchases over the dark web; human trafficking for sex or labor; revenge porn; credit card fraud; child exploitation; and gift or credit card schemes that gangs use to raise cash for their traditional operations or vendettas.In a sense, technology has created an extraordinary moment for industrious criminals, increasing profits without the risk of street violence. Digital villainy can be launched from faraway states, or countries, eliminating physical threats the police traditionally confront. Cyberperpetrators remain unknown. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, ask themselves: Who owns their crimes? Who must investigate them? What are the specific violations? Who are the victims? How can we prevent it?‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s incredibly challenging,‚<U+0080>ù the police chief in Tucson, Chris Magnus, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a lack of clarity.‚<U+0080>ùThe rise of the crimes flies in the face of the proclamations of politicians who declare crime an all but defeated societal ill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to go back to the 1950s to see crime this low,‚<U+0080>ù Bill de Blasio, New York City‚<U+0080><U+0099>s second-term Democratic mayor, said recently on MSNBC‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Morning Joe.‚<U+0080>ù His comments reflected last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s historically low numbers of murders and shootings, burglaries, robberies and auto thefts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> offenses measured by the police CompStat tracking program.But to many criminologists, academics and law enforcement leaders, crimes like car theft are anachronisms in a modern era in which the internet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s virtual superhighways have supplanted brick-and-mortar streets as the scenes for muggings, prostitution rings or commercial burglaries. They see dips in traditional violence and larceny as offset by a twin phenomenon: A surge in the evolving crimes of the digital era, and the fact that they are not fully captured in law enforcement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reporting systems.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the old iceberg metaphor,‚<U+0080>ù said Nola Joyce, a former deputy commissioner of Philadelphia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s police department. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we know about is above the surface. But in terms of value, and in terms of harm, a lot of that crime is below the surface.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an old saying that came out of the Vietnam War,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that said, `If you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t measure what matters, what you measure matters a great deal.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Joyce is working with others on a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, to modernize local and federal crime-classification systems.New solutions are a priority, too, for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and progressive police commanders. They say that without timely, accurate data on crime, criminal justice leaders cannot see and respond coherently to national trends or make informed policy and spending decisions or tailor deployment strategies to best battle them.As Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group that has studied the issue, put it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem is, to use an overused expression, `You don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099> and by that I mean we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know the extent of these incidents in our communities or from a national perspective.‚<U+0080>ùIndeed, an Internet Crime Complaint Center established by the F.B.I. in 2000, to capture internet crime, received 298,728 complaints in 2016, reflecting $1.3 billion in combined losses, according to a new report by Mr. Wexler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group. But Donna Gregory, the head of the center, said that number of complaints only represented about 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims in the United States in 2016, and a fraction of all victims worldwide. In fact, a single category of internet crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> identify theft ‚<U+0080><U+0094> generated $15.4 billion in losses in 2014, according to a crime victimization survey by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.In its report, Mr. Wexler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group said its findings represented a wake-up call for the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 18,000 policing agencies facing an increase in technology-based crimes, that sprawl across jurisdictions, and recommended they fight back with similar tools by: developing their own digital expertise; hiring civilian analysts; mining technology, to help solve crime; encouraging banks to forward reports of theft rather write off their losses.Above all, policing needs ‚<U+0080><U+009C>better systems for gathering data,‚<U+0080>ù the report said.It is an issue that dates back to 1929, when the F.B.I. first rolled out its Uniform Crime Reporting system that still stands today. Designed as a summary count, it mainly tracks a handful of so-called Part One index crimes: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, arson and auto theft. The counts include only the top charge in a given episode.In the 1980s, the F.B.I., with Bureau of Justice Statistics, tried to improve the reporting by building the so-called National Incident-Based Reporting System to capture deeper levels of data across more categories. It created, for instance, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>crimes against a person‚<U+0080>ù which includes: assault, murder, kidnapping, abduction and sexual offenses. Each act is counted separately, within an incident or a crime that encompasses several criminal elements.But 40 years later, data collection is still haphazard as policing agencies that protect just 31 percent of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s population volunteer to abide by the deeper reporting standards. (An example: There is no national database of police officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> use of deadly physical force.) Still, the F.B.I. is charging forward, vowing to move fully to its 1980s-era vision by 2021. Only last year did it began collecting data on two new offenses in its fraud category: hacking/computer invasion and identify theft.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crime data reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in its current state ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is not collecting the right information to understand and analyze current events,‚<U+0080>ù Stephen G. Fischer Jr., an F.B.I. spokesman, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s information age has changed how we see the world and what the world expects from policing.‚<U+0080>ùThe panel of the National Academy of Sciences is looking past the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unmet goals ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which it sees as one component of a new approach. The panel wants a fresh system for understanding the nature and extent of crime today, said Janet L. Lauritsen, the panel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chair and a criminology professor at the University of Missouri.It envisions a format modeled in part, on an international framework organized by the United Nations that would reflect 11 prime categories of crime and 189 sublevels, including many that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>are just not even part of the national conversation on crime,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lauritsen said. It would, for instance, capture reports from federal agencies, she said, that have never reported crime data to the F.B.I., ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even though there is actually a law on the books,‚<U+0080>ù the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act, from 1988, that compels it.Better data fosters transparency, which can build trust with civilians even if it yields statistical crime increases, said Col. Edwin C. Roessler Jr., the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., who is the F.B.I. director‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chairman for converting policing to a new crime classification system. Data offers the evidence to lobby government for more money or better laws, he said. In fact, when Colonel Roessler demonstrated how each gang homicide, on average, required 25 search warrants for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberdata, cellphones and other social media,‚<U+0080>ù it helped win financing for a new Cyber Bureau and new ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberexperts‚<U+0080>ù to work gang cases and build meaningful statistics and intelligence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got gaps here, where we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not catching the root causes of all kinds of criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù the colonel said, a flaw with real-life consequences.So too, for Chief Magnus, in Tucson, who sees the lack of modern-day crime classification as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one of our biggest frustrations.‚<U+0080>ù As he leads a force of 850 officers patrolling 300 square miles, lapses in accurate statistics on property crime, fraud, human trafficking and digital crime hurt his ability to deploy thin resources.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once you get into cyberspace,‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>data about anything is so limited that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really, really hard to figure out even what might be happening locally that impacts that crime.‚<U+0080>ùWhen the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed in 1993, Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bloody troubles did not die with him. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here,‚<U+0080>ù Maria McFarland S√°nchez-Moreno, who spent years as a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch, writes about the harrowing violence carried out by paramilitary groups that bloomed in the country in the late 1990s. She focuses on the stories of three men who have tried to help solve the problem against enormous odds: the human rights activist Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Valle, who was murdered for what he exposed; the prosecutor Iv√°n Vel√°squez; and the journalist Ricardo Calder√≥n. The book covers their dangerous efforts, the links between the paramilitaries and Colombia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political establishment, and the influence of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and its war on drugs. Ms. McFarland, now the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, discusses below the bravery of her subjects, the inspiration she takes from photojournalists who work in conflict areas and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It started when I had finished up being a Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch. I had spent six years documenting atrocities and trying to get the government to address them. But I was frustrated, because all those documents I had been producing didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really capture the reality I had gotten to know so well, the stories of these extraordinary people, who despite horrendous conditions often insisted on fighting for truth, for justice; insisted on being incredibly honest even though they could have easily gone in another direction and all the pressures were in that direction. In the United States, anyone who knew anything about Colombia knew about Pablo Escobar and the FARC, but very few people knew about the paramilitaries, and stories usually depicted the heroes as D.E.A. agents or law enforcement. They were missing this whole piece, these ordinary people who make tremendous sacrifices, take huge risks and often get killed because they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re standing on principle.I started out with the idea of just doing an article in 2012. I was very focused on the story of Iv√°n Vel√°squez, who had followed the links between congress and these paramilitary death squads. He had worked very much alone with not much support, and faced an elaborate campaign by high-level government officials and those in the intelligence service to discredit him. As I talked to him, I realized it was part of a much larger story. He was personally connected to the other two characters in the book. I started drafting a book proposal, which took four years to write. The book took two.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I knew that people were brave. But once I started asking them for their stories in details, I was surprised by just how many risks they took. And when I spoke to their family members, they received threats and had themselves been wrapped up in this and terribly impacted. Yet they had never tried to get them to stop doing their work. In fact, Mar√≠a Victoria, Iv√°n‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, kept some very serious threats made against her secret because she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want him to give up what he was doing. She knew it would break him because it was such an important part of who he was, to follow through on his commitment.With Calder√≥n, I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize the sort of risks he had taken. I knew him as a journalist, and I knew he had exposed these scandals and efforts to smear Vel√°squez. I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t realize just how intrepid he was because he was just so humble. Years later, I found out he had actually been abducted by his sources in the intelligence service at one point. They thought he was going to betray them and they needed to know if he was being straight with them. They gave him this drug to tell the truth and he lost consciousness overnight. He just kept going with his work; met with them the next day and they apologized.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I started out with a very important story about one man who led these investigations and was attacked and then prevailed. It turned into a much richer story when I brought in these other characters and dug into the history. Once I had a broader scope and more characters, I could trace the arc of how the paramilitaries grew and what they were, and how they were able to gain so much power and influence and develop all these connections, in a way I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have been able to do if the book had been about one set of investigations.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Photojournalists, in general, who have worked in some of these conflicts. One of them is Stephen Ferry, with whom I worked very closely in Colombia. He captured the humanity and all sorts of nuances of the reality of Colombia in ways that aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t usually presented in journalism and in the policy world. Seeing someone who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to capture those deeper aspects of reality made me also want to do that.Another piece that made an impression on me while I was writing the book was Joshua Oppenheimer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Look of Silence,‚<U+0080>ù a sequel to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Act of Killing.‚<U+0080>ù He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s able to show what it means for people to live with a legacy of mass atrocity while the perpetrators are still in power, and in a way that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what was happening in Colombia while I was there.Persuade someone to read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There Are No Dead Here‚<U+0080>ù in 50 words or less.It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a fast-paced true story, something of a thriller. It introduces you to brutality and corruption in a country at the center of the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> war on drugs. It also offers hope that brave, committed people who care about what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right can make a difference.This interview has been condensed and edited.Your book ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Doomsday Machine‚<U+0080>ù is a warning, based on your experience at the highest levels of nuclear planning at RAND in the early 1960s, that an accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust killing nearly every human alive could happen much more easily than most people realize ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which is a pretty urgent message. Why did it take you nearly 60 years to write about it? It didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. I submitted the first third of the book to a publisher in 1975, as soon as the war ended. Her response was we would only sell 1,400 copies of this book. So I thought, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All right, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s enough for every member of Congress and a lot of media people and academics.‚<U+0080>ù And she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No, that means we wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t publish it.‚<U+0080>ù And that was reiterated a number of times in succeeding years.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re warning people that human civilization itself is at risk, and so many people don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be concerned. Does it ever make you feel as if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re the crazy one? No, it makes me feel that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m living in a country in a very intense state of denial. I was saying to my wife the other day, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You know, if I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know any more than the public knows about the nuclear danger, I wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be worried about it either.‚<U+0080>ùIf an accidental nuclear war does happen, will you have the willpower not to tell everyone ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I told you so?‚<U+0080>ù Well, how much time would I have? In San Francisco I would expect to be within the range of immediate effects.You were 30 years old when you wrote America‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nuclear-war plans for the defense secretary, Robert McNamara. Is that too much responsibility for someone that young? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s too much responsibility for an 86-year-old or a 70-year-old. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve ever had a human leader in any state that could really live up to that responsibility.How does it feel to write a plan that would kill tens of millions of people? I was in denial. I was part of a plan that should never have been made that was a crime against humanity. I once came to a disarmament press conference at the U.N., and Time had just had a picture on their cover of a terrorist, and I showed this picture from Time, and I said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I want to see a nuclear terrorist, I just have to look in the mirror.‚<U+0080>ù Now if you say, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do I feel about that?‚<U+0080>ù Well, I feel terrible.How surprised are you that there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a nuclear apocalypse yet? I am surprised. On the whole, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been incredibly lucky. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something like a miracle, but miracles, I guess, do happen. Could we survive another 70 or 100 years without nuclear winter? It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unlikely, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not impossible. But no matter how small the likelihood is, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m working to try to double it.Do you think President Trump is utilizing the madman theory with North Korea, purposely making them think he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unstable, or is he just a madman? Oh, sure, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very explicit about it. He says he cannot reject first use of nuclear weapons, because you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to keep it on the table. Well, that worried people, because he looks crazy, so people thought, Gee, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not just using the theory here, he is unfortunately making a very credible threat. But since the mid-‚<U+0080><U+0099>60s the idea of initiating nuclear war by the U.S. has been nothing other than a madman theory. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been insane to think of doing that.You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re most famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers, which are the subject of the movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Post.‚<U+0080>ù What do you think of how you were portrayed? Very, very well, because I was portrayed by a terrific actor who looks a lot as I did at the time, only better.The charges against you were thrown out after it was discovered that Richard Nixon‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>plumbers‚<U+0080>ù broke into your psychoanalyst‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office looking for dirt on you. Does it ever amaze you that after carrying out the biggest leak of government secrets in American history, you pretty much got off scot-free? It was a miracle. As I say, secular miracles do happen.ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain By Abby Norman 272 pp. Nation Books. $27.In the 1940s, in their quest to devise an objective pain scale, Cornell University researchers poked an increasingly hot metal rod into the hands of 13 women in the throes of childbirth. The volunteers were supposed to express how each level of heat compared with the others. But as labor progressed and the rod got hotter, they were in too much distress (and quite possibly distracted with other kinds of pain) to grapple with adjectives. Throbbing? Searing? A 7 on a scale of 10?And therein lies the conundrum. Few of us can express our aches and hurts accurately, particularly when we are in the thick of them.This quirky bit of medical history opens Abby Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vivid memoir, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus.‚<U+0080>ù But the focus of the book is really in the subtitle: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pain.‚<U+0080>ù She builds a convincing case that women describing discomfort are more likely than men to be dismissed by physicians, but along the way tells a story that will resonate with anyone (man or woman) who has ever experienced pain.Norman suffers from endometriosis ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a chronic and debilitating illness triggered by uterine-like cells growing outside of the womb. Women with the disorder have heavy, agonizing periods along with a litany of other symptoms depending on where the rogue cells lurk. If they congregate near the bladder, urinating hurts; near the sciatic nerve, pain can shoot down the legs; inside the lung (a rare event), breathing can be stifled.After one bout ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>as sudden as a thunderclap. A stabbing pain in my middle‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Norman eventually got to an emergency room, where she was handed the typical 1-10 pain scorecard. She was still aching, but not in the original horrors of it all. So she didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know how to assign a number to it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Bad enough that I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ignore it, which made it definitely higher than a four or five.‚<U+0080>ù She questioned whether she was a six or higher and whether the doctor would believe her anyhow.Norman repeatedly told doctors that sexual intercourse ached ‚<U+0080><U+009C>like a dull pinch, that resonated to my pelvis.‚<U+0080>ù No one paid attention until her boyfriend accompanied her and mentioned his frustration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Becoming a disappointment to a man,‚<U+0080>ù she writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>seemed to do the trick.‚<U+0080>ùNorman is a terrific storyteller with a gift for weaving memorable anecdotes, some drawn from medical history, others from recent scientific debates and most plucked from her own travails. We learn about Sigmund Freud and his views of his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hysterical‚<U+0080>ù female clients. We read about baby monkeys who grew up with emotional issues because their real cuddly moms were removed at birth and replaced with pretend wire-doll monkey-mothers. We learn of recent ideas challenging long-held notions about the origins of endometriosis. Many experts no longer believe the disease is triggered by uterine cells that escaped the womb, but rather by uterine-like cells that originated outside of it.Norman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life is much more than a disease. She emancipated herself from her family at the age of 16 and sought solace in books, particularly scientific literature, to understand her symptoms. Many doctors chalked up her distress to physical expressions of a psychic trauma.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ask Me About My Uterus‚<U+0080>ù is an important addition to a long tradition of pain memoirs. Norman shares a particular tale of suffering but expresses a common frustration about the dearth of words to convey pain. Any schoolgirl can talk about love, Virginia Woolf famously said, but ‚<U+0080><U+009C>let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.‚<U+0080>ùJERUSALEM ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Polish and Israeli officials met on Thursday to address the diplomatic rift that erupted over a new Polish law that makes it a crime to blame Poland for the Holocaust, a measure that Israeli officials have likened to Holocaust denial.The law, adopted last month over the furious objections of Israel and scholars from around the world, makes it a crime to blame ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the Polish nation‚<U+0080>ù for the Holocaust and other World War II atrocities carried out by the Nazis during their occupation from 1939 to 1945.It was the Nazis who oversaw the exterminations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by means of mass shootings, gas chambers, starvation and slave labor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that claimed the lives of some six million Jews. But the role of Polish collaborators, participants and enablers in the Nazi-run system of mechanized death remains a subject of fraught historical inquiry.Poland‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right-wing government says its goal is to defend the nation from slander, but scholars say the result is to stifle inquiry and reconciliation.Last week, a group of Poles who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II added their voices to the debate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We ask you not to rewrite history,‚<U+0080>ù the Poles ‚<U+0080><U+0094> among 6,850 Poles recognized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>righteous among the nations‚<U+0080>ù for their heroism ‚<U+0080><U+0094> wrote in an open letter to both Polish and Israeli leaders.One of those who signed the letter was Anna Stupnicka-Bando, 89, who was a teenager when she and her mother smuggled books and food into the Warsaw ghetto. It was during one of those illegal trips that they met an 11-year-old Jewish girl, Liliana Adler, whom they hid in their two-bedroom apartment at her father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s urging.Posing as Anna‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cousin, Liliana lived with the family ‚<U+0080><U+0094> under their neighbors‚<U+0080><U+0099> suspicious gazes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for four years until they were liberated by the Soviet Army in 1945.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everyone knows that there were those who were good and those who were bad,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said in a phone interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those who were saving Jews, and those who were robbing and murdering them. There were heroes just as there were thieves and killers. Just like there were in every other nation. To say different is harmful and nonsensical.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is it now with all this counting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> this checking how many of us were good and how many were bad? We are not some potatoes planted in a field that can be counted. We are people. Let it go.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Stupnicka-Bando said the new dispute was unnecessary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In recent years, we had finally managed to get some peace and quiet,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like all those conflicts and tensions were gone. How can they be back? How can one unfortunate phrase, one inaccurately written sentence destroy all of it?‚<U+0080>ùOn Thursday, Israeli and Polish diplomats met for more than three hours in what the Israeli Foreign Ministry described as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>candid and open dialogue,‚<U+0080>ù although the talks were inconclusive.The Israeli side was represented by Yuval Rotem, the ministry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director general, and included diplomats, legal experts and historians from Yad Vashem.At the start of the talks, Mr. Rotem told the Polish team ‚<U+0080><U+0094> led by the deputy foreign minister, Bartosz Cichocki ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no secret‚<U+0080>ù that the legislation was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a matter of concern to Israel and to the Jewish people worldwide.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We must make sure that historical truths are preserved, that there be no restrictions on the freedom of research and speech, and that the wide threat of criminalization in this regard is addressed and resolved.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the closed-door talks, the ministry said it was especially concerned about ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the criminalization clause, which constitutes an obstacle to the study of the truth and to open historical debate.‚<U+0080>ùThe statement also expressed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>concern about the public atmosphere that had recently been created in Poland and manifestations of anti-Semitism, and stressed the need for the Polish government to act with zero tolerance in the face of anti-Semitism.‚<U+0080>ùThe dispute has strained relations between Israel and Poland. At a security conference last month in Munich, Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, confronted his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki.During a discussion, Ronen Bergman, a journalist who covers intelligence affairs for Yediot Ahronot and writes for The New York Times Magazine,  remarked that his parents, who were born in Poland, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lost much of their families because their Polish neighbors snitched to the Gestapo.‚<U+0080>ùHe added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After the war my mother swore she would never speak Polish for the rest of her life, not even a single word.‚<U+0080>ùIn a rambling response, Mr. Morawiecki said it would remain legal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian, not only German perpetrators.‚<U+0080>ùThe reference to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jewish perpetrators‚<U+0080>ù infuriated Israelis and others. Mr. Netanyahu called the comments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>outrageous‚<U+0080>ù and added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people.‚<U+0080>ùEven so, Mr. Netanyahu has resisted pressure from legislators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including some from within his governing coalition ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to recall Israel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ambassador to Poland.In an opinion article in Haaretz on Thursday, the deputy prime minister of Poland, Jaroslaw Gowin, said that Israeli-Polish cooperation had improved in recent years and urged further dialogue.How the law will be enforced remains to be seen. Historians, journalists and artists are to be exempted from prosecution under the law, and Joanna Kopcinska, a government spokeswoman, said that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>witnesses of history‚<U+0080>ù would also be exempt.The Polish government, which has also curbed judicial independence and the press, is feuding with the European Union over the state of the rule of law in Poland.On Thursday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the European Commission, the bloc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executive body, which has threatened to strip Poland of voting rights because of threats to democratic norms.The commission warned Poland this week that it had until March 20 to backtrack on its judicial changes before Brussels takes action. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The clock is ticking,‚<U+0080>ù Michael Roth, Germany‚<U+0080><U+0099>s minister for European Union affairs, told journalists.The tensions on both fronts might have given the governing Law and Justice party pause. This week, the speaker of Parliament delayed debate on a proposal to establish a day of memorial honoring Poles who saved Jews.Ms. Stupnicka-Bando said she hoped the current tensions were a result of a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>misunderstanding and not ill will.‚<U+0080>ù She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We, the righteous ones, are optimists.‚<U+0080>ùEwa Junczyk-Ziomecka, the president of the Jan Karski Educational Foundation, which organized the open letter, noted that many of the letter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s signers were in their 90s, and she worried that memories of righteous acts were fading.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried that their legacy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the mutual understanding between Poles and Jews they achieved ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might now be lost,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said.She added that it would be important to study the experiences of both groups ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Jews inside the ghetto walls, non-Jewish Poles in their occupied country.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jews and Poles spent years learning about what is a source of pain for the Jews, and what it is in the Polish soul that hurts,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Junczyk-Ziomecka said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Their memories complete each other. They can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t imagine that someone might break them apart.‚<U+0080>ùA level-headed documentary lies behind the hot-blooded title of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy: Death, Denial & Depiction.‚<U+0080>ù While there may be no completely dispassionate way to discuss its topic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Armenian genocide ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s balance of emotion and composure helps make its stories even stronger.Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in the early part of the 20th century. What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.Joe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Promise,‚<U+0080>ù a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plan is smart as well as symbolic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.At its core, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Intent to Destroy‚<U+0080>ù is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,‚<U+0080>ù one scholar says near the end of the documentary. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>History is not in the past.‚<U+0080>ùOn most days, Facebook doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much in common with President Trump. But at the moment, both are in the damage-control business, as they try to get out from under the cloud of suspicion related to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meddling in the 2016 election.Their goals collided in awkward fashion over the weekend when Rob Goldman, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of advertising, posted a series of messages on Twitter that were meant to clear up misconceptions about Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s role in the election. Instead, he plunged the company deeper into controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Goldman tweeted. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.‚<U+0080>ùHe continued: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman was tweeting only for himself, but his comments, which drew praise from other Facebook executives on Twitter, were an unusually candid statement that flouted Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s well-sculpted messaging strategy, which has generally been to stay as far away from partisan debates as possible. The tweets arrived soon after the blockbuster indictment of Russian nationals by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and they were noticed by right-wing partisans, who saw them as supporting evidence for Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no collusion‚<U+0080>ù claims. Soon, Mr. Trump himself had retweeted them approvingly.Mr. Goldman eventually walked back some of his statements, but it was too late. Mr. Goldman had just given Mr. Trump something that looked like a Facebook-stamped exoneration.Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t mean to bolster the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s position.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,‚<U+0080>ù Joel Kaplan, Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.It is Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.But Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mistakes have been. (Last year, in a tweet that fewer people saw, Andrew Bosworth, another Facebook vice president, claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>marginal, even in a close election.‚<U+0080>ù)In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.Even before Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigation had found. He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s favor was not a primary goal of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller‚<U+0080><U+0099>s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interference from outside researchers.Some of Mr. Goldman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far ‚<U+0080><U+0094> such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would be just as effective today.In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve tried.) But it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform‚<U+0080><U+0099>s problems and protecting our democracy.Once you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve read an excellent book about climate change, which Jeff Goodell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù most certainly is, you can never unremember the facts. Elected officials may be busy arguing about whether global warming is real. But most scientists are having other arguments entirely ‚<U+0080><U+0094> about whether danger is imminent or a few decades off; about whether our prospects are dire or merely grim.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has little trouble imagining it. He opens ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù with a fictional hurricane whipping through Miami in 2037. It sweeps the Art Deco buildings of South Beach off their foundations, disgorges millions of gallons of raw sewage into Biscayne Bay and eats the last of the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s beaches. Thousands scramble for bottled water dropped by the National Guard. Zika and dengue fever start to bloom (so much moisture, so many mosquitoes). Out rush the retirees and glamour pusses; in rush the lawyers and slumlords. Within decades, the place is swallowed whole by the ocean. What was once a vibrant city is now a scuba-diving destination for intrepid historians and disaster tourists.The whole scenario seems indecently feasible by the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end.After this year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s calamitous flooding in Houston and the Caribbean, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come‚<U+0080>ù is depressingly well-timed, though I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m guessing all good books about this subject will be from now on. Political time now lags behind geological time: If we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take dramatic steps to prepare for the rising seas, hundreds of millions could be displaced from their homes by the end of the century, and the infrastructure fringing the coast, valued in the trillions of dollars, could be lost.Unfortunately, human beings are uniquely ill-suited to prepare for disasters they cannot sense or see. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have evolved to defend ourselves from a guy with a knife or an animal with big teeth,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but we are not wired to make decisions about barely perceptible threats that gradually accelerate over time.‚<U+0080>ùSo we stick our heads in the sand. Until the sand disappears, anyway.To give you an idea of why many climate scientists are so nervous: Over the course of the earth‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history, seas have risen drastically whenever ice sheets suddenly collapsed. And that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s precisely what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening now. Greenland is melting at a furious rate ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by 2040, Goodell writes, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to windsurf at the North Pole ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and so are the ice shelves of Antarctica.Many of our climate reports, including the one that formed the basis of the 2015 Paris Agreement, hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t predicted this. Their authors assumed that the most the sea could rise by 2100 was three feet, two inches. Now many scientists believe that estimate is too low. Some say the sea could rise as much as six feet; others say even more than that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For anyone living in Miami Beach or South Brooklyn or Boston‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Back Bay or any other low-lying coastal neighborhood,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the difference between three feet of sea level rise by 2100 and six feet is the difference between a wet but livable city and a submerged city.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell has been writing about climate change for many years. (His previous books include ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Big Coal‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How to Cool the Planet.‚<U+0080>ù) He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the real deal, committed and making house calls. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Water Will Come,‚<U+0080>ù partly built on stories he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s written for Rolling Stone, he visits cities in peril around the globe: New York; Lagos, Nigeria; Norfolk, Va.; Miami; Venice; Rotterdam. He speaks to a great many politicians, including Barack Obama, eventually asking some version of, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given what you know, aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t you scared out of your wits?‚<U+0080>ù (Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s response: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yeah.‚<U+0080>ù) At an art event, Goodell buttonholes an influential developer in Miami, Jorge P√©rez, and asks several variations of the same question. P√©rez insists he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unworried. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Besides,‚<U+0080>ù he adds, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>by that time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be dead, so what does it matter?‚<U+0080>ùThe full exchange is worth reading. It plays out like something from a Carl Hiaasen novel. All that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s missing are the twin blondes in the hot tub.Of all the American cities in this book, Miami seems least equipped to handle a rise in sea level, founded as it is on pleasure, real estate and the inalienable right to not pay state income taxes. (When a local geologist undertook a larger project to show just how much fecal matter was in Biscayne Bay, the mayor of Miami Beach went ballistic.) But every coastal city faces its own obstacles to adaptation, and the problems each one faces are different.Naval Station Norfolk, the largest navy base in the world, may have as few as 20 good years left. Yet it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s located in a climate-denial hot spot in Virginia, and it depends on more than a few climate-deniers in Congress for funding. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Many people in the military end up talking about climate in much the way eighth graders talk about sex ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with code words,‚<U+0080>ù Goodell writes.New York City may have more climate-change realists doing its bidding and spending its dollars. But the barrier the city plans to build to protect Wall Street ‚<U+0080><U+0094> you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to protect Wall Street, right? ‚<U+0080><U+0094> could deflect water into poorer neighborhoods. (And let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not even discuss the fate of the subways.)It is, perhaps, the world‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poor who will suffer most. Goodell devotes a good deal of this book to contemplating their fate. Salty soil has already destroyed the rice crops of the Mekong Delta and Bangladesh. If the sea rises high enough, whole island nations could be washed away. The slum-dwellers of Lagos, Jakarta and other coastal cities in the developing world could be chased from their homes, many of which are already on stilts. The International Organization for Migration estimates there will be 200 million climate refugees by 2050.Yet even countries with means can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get their citizens to focus on this problem. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The average American right now,‚<U+0080>ù Obama tells Goodell, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even if they‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve gotten past climate denial, is still much more concerned about gas prices, getting back and forth from work, than they are about the climate changing.‚<U+0080>ùWater simply isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t on their minds. They‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got more pressing concerns to keep at bay.Looking for love or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>casual encounter‚<U+0080>ù? You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have to find it someplace other than Craigslist.The venerable online classifieds site removed its ‚<U+0080><U+009C>personals‚<U+0080>ù section this week, after Congress sent a bill to President Trump aimed at curtailing sex trafficking.Craigslist, little changed since it unveiled its spare text design in 1995 and began to crush the paid print classifieds business, will no longer offer a way for anonymous people to connect for romance or sex.While many people used the site to find relationships ‚<U+0080><U+0094> one of the discontinued categories is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strictly platonic‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it was no secret that some postings were thinly veiled solicitations for prostitution, despite the site‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to fight overt solicitations for money.Visitors to the personals section of Craigslist are now redirected to a short statement about the bill, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which gives law enforcement officials greater authority to go after websites used for sex trafficking, while removing protections from legal liability for hosting such content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any tool or service can be misused,‚<U+0080>ù Craigslist said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking Craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through Craigslist, we wish you every happiness!‚<U+0080>ùThe website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personals section has attracted listings of all kinds, reflecting a range of interests, sexual orientations and combinations of partners. Some users have found lasting relationships and marriage.On Friday, inventive users were already turning to other parts of Craigslist, like the famous ‚<U+0080><U+009C>missed connections‚<U+0080>ù section, to post their personals instead.Craigslist has faced criticism over its role in facilitating prostitution and trafficking before. About a decade ago, after reaching an agreement with 40 state attorneys general, it undertook a series of changes in order to curb the practices.The online forums site Reddit also removed a handful of escort-related communities in recent days, though the ban was part of a broader crackdown on the exchange of weapons, drugs, sexual services, stolen goods and falsified documents.Many survivors of sex trafficking and the illegal prostitution trade have praised the legislation as a significant advance in their fight against the practice.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It really provides both survivors and folks in law enforcement with the tools to hold websites that are knowingly facilitating trafficking accountable,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a coalition of groups that worked with the legislators who sponsored the bill.Ms. Hersh said that some websites known to have been used for trafficking have already disappeared.Some tech companies, civil liberties groups and organizations of voluntary sex workers have argued that the bill overreaches.Though its goal is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>worthy,‚<U+0080>ù the bill may have unintended consequences, Ian Thompson, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a post this month.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The bill is worded so broadly that it could even be used against platform owners that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know that their sites are being used for trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a statement after the Senate passed the bill.Even anti-trafficking organizations are not united in their support. Freedom Network USA, a coalition of groups, said in a statement that the bill would only drive voluntary sex workers further underground.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Consensual commercial sex workers use harm reduction tools such as online forums to screen clients, avoid high risk activities, share resources, and protect each other,‚<U+0080>ù it said.While Ms. Hersh acknowledged that there may be some in the sex trade who use the websites willingly, the bill, she said, will save many others from exploitation.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We work with survivors, many of whom have been exploited on these websites, and so we are seeing firsthand the extraordinary harm that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening to many women and children,‚<U+0080>ù she said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.With passage of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to stay out of the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,‚<U+0080>ù the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a wake-up call,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.‚<U+0080>ùPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sex trafficking,‚<U+0080>ù he added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And down the road, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s content from foreign governments.‚<U+0080>ùInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s required,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.‚<U+0080>ùWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law ‚<U+0080><U+009C>would almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,‚<U+0080>ù said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking. During the investigation, Mr. Portman and Mr. Blumenthal heard from state law enforcement officials who said that they were not able to press charges against websites like Backpage.com, which evoked safe harbor under the liability portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re opening the courthouse doors,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said after Wednesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vote.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, nearly 90 percent of the trafficking of children occurs online. Seven out of 10 child trafficking reports involve Backpage.com, the group said.But over the past seven years, 20 cases involving the website were rejected by courts that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>acknowledged the horror of the allegations made regarding the child victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> trafficking‚<U+0080>ù but were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>powerless to act,‚<U+0080>ù Yiota G. Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Congress last November.The liability provision, created by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was intended to help foster the growth of the nascent internet. It was adopted before smartphones and companies like Google and Facebook existed.On Wednesday, Mr. Wyden argued on the Senate floor that the bill as written would harm the internet economy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll pull up the ladder, leaving the established giants at the top,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Wyden said. Start-ups need the legal shield most, not tech giants, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The big guys can take care of themselves.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Wyden was one of two senators to oppose the bill; the other was Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.Dozens of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates hailed the bill as landmark action to fight trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a huge day for victims because we are finally saying enough is enough,‚<U+0080>ù said Lauren Hersh, the national director for World Without Exploitation, a group for victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> rights. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They will no longer allow companies to profit from ads that make millions off the backs of exploited people.‚<U+0080>ùNEW YORK ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The leader of a secretive group in upstate New York turned female followers into brainwashed ""slaves"" who were branded with his initials and coerced into having sex, authorities alleged on Monday in a criminal complaint charging him with sex-trafficking.Keith Raniere, co-founder of the group called Nxivm, was arrested in Mexico and returned to Texas Monday, authorities said. He was to appear in court on Tuesday in Fort Worth on the charges filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.According to the complaint, Raniere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known within the group as ""Vanguard"" ‚<U+0080><U+0094> oversaw a barbaric system in which women were told the best way to advance was to become a ""slave"" overseen by ""masters."" They also were expected to have sex with him and do menial chores for masters, and to keep the arrangement a secret or be publicly humiliated, the complaint says.The name of Raniere's attorney wasn't immediately available on Monday. In a letter attributed to Raniere previously posted on a website related to Nxivm, he denied the practices were sanctioned by the self-described self-help group.""These allegations are most disturbing to me as non-violence is one of my most important values,"" the letter said.The complaint said that many victims participated in videotaped ceremonies where they were branded in their pelvic area with a symbol featuring Raniere's initials.""During the branding ceremonies, slaves were required to be fully naked, and the master would order one slave to film while the other held down the slave being branded,"" the complaint says.Investigators said Raniere preferred exceptionally thin women, so ""slaves"" had to stick to very low-calorie diets and document every food they ate. As punishment for not following orders, women were forced to attend classes where they were ""forced to wear fake cow udders over their breasts while people called them derogatory names,"" or threatened with being put in cages, court papers say.Raniere left the United States late last year after The New York Times reported the stories of some women who defected from their secret sorority and the government began interviewing potential witnesses. He sought to cover this trail by using encrypted email and ditching his phone, court papers say.He was ultimately found staying with several women in a luxury gated community in Puerta Vallarta where villas can run $10,000 a week to rent, investigators say. After authorities took him into custody on a U.S. warrant, investigators said the women got into a high-speed car chase.The website related to the group describes Raniere as a ""scientist, mathematician, philosopher, entrepreneur, educator, inventor and author"" who has ""devoted his life to studying the human psychodynamic and developing new tools for human empowerment, expression and ethics.""Nxivm's Mexican affiliate is headed by Emiliano Salinas, a son of that country's former president. Several women who belong to the group in Mexico have traveled to Albany, where they were branded, two former Nxivm members told the Times.Salinas has also denied that the sorority is affiliated with Nxivm.Raniere and Nxivm have been the subject of criticism for years, dating back to at least 2012 when the Times Union of Albany published a series of articles examining the organization and allegations that it was like a cult.Over the years, Nxivm has attracted a following that includes Emmy Award-winning actress Allison Mack. Authorities also say Raniere has been bankrolled by Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune.Bronfman gave millions of dollars covering expenses like private air travel costing $65,000 flight, court papers say.The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies.Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive.But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Congress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t able to commit offline.‚<U+0080>ùA similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon.The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield.The bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms.Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Clearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,‚<U+0080>ù said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I still don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.‚<U+0080>ùFacebook began to change its position on the bill last fall, before congressional hearings on sex-trafficking bills and an intelligence committee hearing on Russian influence on social networks.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,‚<U+0080>ù Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.‚<U+0080>ùSome large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills.Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.Three pastors accused of exploiting and abusing teenage girls were indicted this week on federal child sex trafficking charges in Toledo, Ohio.The men, Kenneth Butler, 37; Anthony J. Haynes, 38; and Cordell Jenkins, 47, were charged with conspiracy for child sex trafficking as part of an 11-count indictment handed down on Tuesday, the United States Attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office for the Northern District of Ohio said. The three men pleaded not guilty.They are accused of sexually assaulting a girl beginning in 2014, when she was 14, through 2017. Some of the abuse is thought to have taken place at hotels and at Greater Life Christian Center in Toledo, where Mr. Haynes was a pastor and used his telephone to record the sexual assaults, prosecutors said.Mr. Haynes gave the girl money and told her not to tell anyone, saying it would ruin his family and his church, according to court documents. He ‚<U+0080><U+009C>facilitated‚<U+0080>ù the victim being abused by several other men, including Mr. Jenkins, who repeatedly sexually exploited the girl at his home, in his office at Abundant Life Ministries, and at a motel in Toledo, prosecutors said.Mr. Jenkins recorded the abuse with his cellphone and paid the girl with what he called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hush money,‚<U+0080>ù court documents said. He also allegedly abused a second girl in March of this year.Mr. Butler, who was a pastor at Kingdom Encounter Family Worship Center in Detroit, about an hour from Toledo, was also indicted on sex trafficking charges involving a third girl who was abused between 2015 and March 2017, the court documents said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three have religious affiliations and knew each other in that capacity,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Tobin, a spokesman for the United States attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All three claim to be ministers in one form or another.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges are part of a superseding indictment that expands sex trafficking charges originally handed down in April against Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Haynes, and adds Mr. Butler as a defendant in the case. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It takes the three of them and loops them all into one big conspiracy with three victims,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Tobin.The three men will remain in custody until their next hearing, scheduled for January.Allison Folmar, a lawyer for Mr. Jenkins, said on Thursday that he had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>done a lot of good‚<U+0080>ù in his community, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but all of that is clearly overshadowed with what he is facing right now.‚<U+0080>ùA lawyer for Mr. Butler, Adam S. Nightingale, confirmed on Thursday that his client had pleaded not guilty, but did not comment further. Mr. Haynes‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer could not be reached for comment.Just before he was arrested in October, Mr. Butler posted a video on the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Facebook page introducing himself as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pastor B,‚<U+0080>ù and saying he wanted to make a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>public apology.‚<U+0080>ù In the video, which has since been removed, he said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is never my intention to hurt or displease God. Let alone you, the people.‚<U+0080>ùMOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Nearly every day, a teenager is missing from Hawthorne Cedar Knolls, a rehabilitation center for emotionally troubled children that sits on a sprawling campus in this Westchester County town.Home to many young people who have been trafficked for sex, Hawthorne is supposed to help heal them and head off their return to prostitution and exploitation. But the center, run by a nonprofit group and intended to be a relatively open facility, has seen girl after girl, most of them from New York City, go missing.People who have worked in child welfare in and around New York City say there is a pipeline from centers like the ones here back to the streets, where children fall prey to the abuse that they were supposed to escape. Over the last 18 months, the state, which oversees residential treatment centers like Hawthorne, stopped sending children to Hawthorne and to the nearby Pleasantville Cottage School. Among the 51 centers statewide, Hawthorne and Pleasantville are the only ones to have faced such severe sanctions over missing children in recent years.By design and by law, conditions at residential treatment centers are less restrictive than those at many of the other programs for children with severe mental health problems. Residential treatment centers are not juvenile detention centers, and they are supposed to provide a homelike experience. Children cannot be locked down, and older children are encouraged to attend programs outside the campus and hold part-time jobs as part of their rehabilitation. But people who work with the residents said that a lack of rigorous, engaging programs, especially for victims of sex trafficking, had made their open atmosphere a liability.Hawthorne was recently drawn into a trafficking investigation after a teenage girl who went missing from Hawthorne ended up in the Bronx with a 25-year-old man.The man has been charged with sex trafficking, rape, prostitution and other crimes in a state case involving the girl, and he has been charged as a conspirator in a federal investigation of a Bronx drug-trafficking ring.Prosecutors have not accused Hawthorne or its staff of any wrongdoing in connection with sex trafficking. But the involvement of a runaway from Hawthorne in the Bronx case underscored the challenges confronting such programs and the risks faced by some of the girls who are in them.The investigation offers a glimpse into an underworld in which exploitation is hard to document and prosecute. Victims often fear retribution or are wary of law enforcement and refuse to cooperate with investigations, according to lawyers and social workers. But the exploitation is real, said Paul Oliva, the police chief in Mount Pleasant. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We had these girls leaving campus, hooking up with their pimps,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Instead of escaping sexual exploitation, some teenagers are recruited by their peers inside centers and group homes, said Ed Gavin, a former acting chief of staff at the Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services in New York City. A piece of the pipeline in the region flows north to south, from the leafy, idyllic surroundings here to gritty ‚<U+0080><U+009C>trap houses‚<U+0080>ù run by twentysomething drug dealers, Mr. Gavin said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People think of human trafficking as foreign. Human trafficking goes on right in the neighborhood. It goes on in the Bronx,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Gavin, who now works as a private investigator and specializes in finding missing children.The girls at Hawthorne, who range in age from 12 to 21, have been sent there through the recommendations of child welfare agencies, Family Court judges and a special education panel.The majority of the children return to their homes or are sent to a foster home or other setting closer to their families in less than a year, said David Rivel, the chief executive of the Jewish Board of Family and Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, which operates Hawthorne.Many children continue to run until they feel safe at the center, he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kids are not running away from the campus, they are running away from the trauma and abuse they have experienced, which we are encouraging them to face,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rivel said.To prevent children from regressing, there must be a balance between tough love and tolerance of behavioral problems that stem from deep-seated pain, said Jonathan McLean, the director of Hawthorne.The town of Mount Pleasant has long been home to Hawthorne and Pleasantville, which is run by the J.C.C.A., formerly known as the Jewish Child Care Association.About two miles apart, the campuses opened more than a century ago to take in the orphaned children of Jewish immigrants.About 80 young people children live at Pleasantville, while about 50 live at Hawthorne. The overwhelming majority of the residents there are black and Hispanic children from New York City.In an interview, an 18-year-old at Gateways, a program on Pleasantville‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campus for trafficked children, said she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sold her body for money,‚<U+0080>ù new clothes, trips to the nail salon and food.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I always have this thing where I bounce my way into stuff and bounce my way into this,‚<U+0080>ù the teenager said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to explain why people do it or why you do it.‚<U+0080>ùThe teenager said she had enjoyed a visit by local volunteers who brought Jamaican food, cupcakes and pumpkins, but she said she wished some of the staff members were more empathetic. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Be more open and understanding of behaviors. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t shut us out,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Making children feel wanted is key to preventing them from going missing, said Jim Purcell, the chief executive of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, an advocacy group. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For some of these kids, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s showing that someone cares,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Some of these kids AWOL to see if somebody is going to stop them.‚<U+0080>ùChief Oliva said his department, which has 45 officers, was stretched thin by helping to investigate sex trafficking cases involving missing girls, and by responding to calls from the centers and complaints from residents.To push the nonprofits to improve security, the town began charging them a fine of $250 last year for calls about missing children, he said. (As of October, the town had issued the fine 15 times.) The fines were instituted in part because residents had complained about crimes committed by children from the centers, but Mr. Oliva said it was important to remember that the children were being hurt or put in harm‚<U+0080><U+0099>s way.From July 2016 though June, about 73 percent of the 188 New York City children at Hawthorne were reported missing, a rate that was significantly higher than those for similar programs.Mr. Rivel said the numbers at Hawthorne had been skewed by the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>overreporting‚<U+0080>ù of cases in which children had gone missing for just a few hours, but he did not dispute that the numbers reflected a crisis and that elected officials needed to help. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have a real problem here, a real challenge here,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Last year, the Jewish Board and J.C.C.A. hired directors of security, new positions for both nonprofits.At Pleasantville, the J.C.C.A. added more cameras, new lighting and new two-way radios. At Hawthorne, the Jewish Board began following children in a van on the 20-minute walk from the campus to the nearby Metro-North Railroad station. The board also installed a six-foot-high fence that stretches 200 feet through trees and brush.The tactics have reduced the number of children who go missing, though the figure remains strikingly high at Hawthorne. Since the state allowed Hawthorne to begin accepting new residents in August, about 54 percent of the 79 New York City children living there have been absent at some point, according to city data.But the idea of using highly restrictive security measures is at odds with a strong belief by many experts that emotionally damaged children should not be criminalized.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honestly, their goal is to protect these kids,‚<U+0080>ù said Staca Shehan, the executive director of the case analysis division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But at the end of the day, there hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t been a way to force services upon them,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The field as a whole really doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have a consensus because running away from services is so prevalent.‚<U+0080>ùAdvocates said there was a need for more state funding for programs that engage children. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Those are the things that get lost in the shuffle when there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no money,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Purcell said.Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, a Queens Democrat who is the chairman of the social services committee, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has cut the operating budgets of the agencies that oversee troubled children by nearly 17 percent since fiscal 2012 to keep a vow to curb state spending.The state described the cuts as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cost savings‚<U+0080>ù unrelated to the direct funding of treatment centers.The state provides money to local districts that negotiate annual rates with the nonprofit organizations that run the centers ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Jewish Board receives $419.78 per day for each child, and the J.C.C.A. receives $431.36. The state could set higher rates for the next fiscal year because of the cost of the new security measures at Hawthorne and Pleasantville, state officials said.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After a bruising week before lawmakers, big internet companies including Facebook and Google relented to pressure in Washington on Friday and agreed to support a sex trafficking bill they had vehemently opposed for months.The bill would allow victims to sue websites that knowingly support and assist sex trafficking on their site. State attorneys general would also be able to go after the websites that support sex trafficking content.The companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.Under those conditions, the bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act, became an unpopular lobbying battle for the tech companies. Rivals such as the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Oracle and HP joined civil rights groups like National Urban League in support of the Senate bill.After weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill ‚<U+0080><U+009C>will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,‚<U+0080>ù said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This important bill will hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,‚<U+0080>ù said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The bill amends Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, established in 1996, that protects online companies from liability over content they hosted on their sites. Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Removing the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shield of immunity,‚<U+0080>ù said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The Senate‚<U+0080><U+0099>s latest effort to crack down on online sex trafficking is designed for success. Proposed legislation has an unassailable title, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017, and bipartisan support. And it targets websites that knowingly facilitate the work of sexual predators online.But the bill is running into vigorous opposition from technology companies and digital rights groups alarmed at the potential infringement of online speech.So far, the bill, which would amend the Communications Decency Act, is sponsored by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and a group of 26 other senators, including eight Democrats.It follows the culmination of a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website notorious for prostitution and trafficking ads.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Finally, victims of human trafficking are going to see justice when we get this passed, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really important to many of us who have been following this,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. This summer, the committee recommended that the Justice Department open a criminal investigation into the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s connection to online sex trafficking, citing evidence that Backpage employees were instructed to delete flagged words indicative of trafficking ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lolita,‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>rape,‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>teenage‚<U+0080>ù among them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before publishing the advertisements online.In federal and state investigations, Backpage has successfully cited as a defense Section 230 of the decency act, which says that websites cannot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.‚<U+0080>ùIf passed, the Portman bill would clarify that Section 230 cannot shield a website from federal trafficking laws. It would also impose liability for knowingly assisting and facilitating online sex trafficking, and allow civil suits related to sex trafficking.Backpage.com officials did not respond to requests for comment. The website announced in January that it had formally closed its adult section after the Senate investigation found that employers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>knowingly facilitated the criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women and young girls,‚<U+0080>ù but trafficking advertisements have been reported in the website‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dating section.The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which praised the bill in a letter to senators this week, reported that 73 percent of reported sex trafficking was traced through advertisements on websites like Backpage.However, some lawyers and members of the technology community say that while they support the policing of websites that knowingly encourage sex trafficking, the broad language of the bill opens other online entities to new legal challenges. With the potential for lawsuits, there is concern that websites would begin to actively and pre-emptively delete and police users‚<U+0080><U+0099> posts and videos.A similar bill introduced in the House in April, which would not only modify the decency act but create harsher penalties for providers found to have had knowledge of sex trafficking, has been criticized for being even broader than the Senate bill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It would be good for the drafters of the bill to engage seriously with the nontrivial objections that are meant to support freedom of expression online, and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not freedom of expression to sex traffic,‚<U+0080>ù said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a professor of internet law at Harvard, emphasizing that critics were not arguing against prosecuting websites like Backpage.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are worried about sites that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t resemble Backpage at all running into trouble if the immunity is lifted,‚<U+0080>ù he said. Like many other critics of the bill, Mr. Zittrain said he would prefer narrower language or the chance to prosecute websites under current legislation, including the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015.And despite the strong bipartisan support in Congress, the bill will have to overcome dissent from other lawmakers and Silicon Valley executives concerned about freedom of speech on the internet.But Senate staff members involved in the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development said that they had made an effort to work with tech companies concerned about modifying the decency act. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We did our due diligence, met these folks on a bipartisan basis for months, and yet they offered no constructive feedback,‚<U+0080>ù said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Portman. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sad that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>d oppose a narrowly crafted, two-page bill to help stop online sex trafficking of women and children.‚<U+0080>ùSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who was partially responsible for the inclusion of Section 230 in the decency act while serving in the House, said the bill was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another example of the technical ignorance of Congress threatening the jobs, lives and economic opportunities of millions of Americans.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This bill will make it less likely that tech companies help the victims this bill is meant to protect,‚<U+0080>ù he said Tuesday in a statement.Michael Beckerman, president and chief executive of the Internet Association, a trade group that represents major online companies, said in a statement that the bill would create ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a new wave of frivolous and unpredictable actions against legitimate companies rather than addressing underlying criminal behavior.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Portman said such criticism of the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language was unfounded. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seems like a stretch to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that he felt the bill clearly targeted companies complicit in trafficking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The alternative is not to do nothing and allow these girls and women to continue to get thwarted in every effort they make to seek justice,‚<U+0080>ù he said.In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday night, Mr. Portman argued that the bill preserved the decency act‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good Samaritan‚<U+0080>ù provision, which protects websites that regulate their content.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This provision simply protects good actors who proactively block or screen for offensive material and thus shields them from any frivolous lawsuits,‚<U+0080>ù he said.For Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, the bill‚<U+0080><U+0099>s language ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in particular phrases like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>assist, support or facilitate sex trafficking‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>conduct violates federal criminal law‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are too vague in defining what constitutes facilitation and violation. While she supports modest change to the statute, she said she would rather see the courts re-evaluate their interpretation of the law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s specific language.Critics also say the bill opens up websites to potential prosecution by states, a change that could force sites to make costly modifications to meet state laws or expose them to expensive litigation if a law is changed or accidentally ignored, said Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates civil liberties online.It is a cost that tech giants like Google, YouTube and Twitter can handle, but that would likely stifle the development of new and smaller websites.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I worry about the next Google, the next Twitter, the next emerging platform that we would grow to love,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. McSherry said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never exist because that platform, that business would never get off the ground.‚<U+0080>ùCHICAGO ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The young women, many of them from poor families in Thailand, were promised trips to the United States. They would also receive visas. Life in cities like Chicago would be rosy, they were told, and they would be able to help support their families back home.But the promises, the federal authorities say, came with an enormous toll: The women were required to work as prostitutes in cities all over this country until they could pay off exorbitant ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bondage debts,‚<U+0080>ù set as high as $60,000, to the very people who had promised them better lives.Law enforcement authorities on Thursday announced federal sex-trafficking conspiracy charges against 21 people, part of what they described as one of the most elaborate and extensive sex-trafficking operations they had seen. The operation had gone on for at least eight years, netted tens of millions of dollars, and involved hundreds of women who were shuttled among American cities, sometimes every few weeks, the officials said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The women did not have freedom of movement and, until they paid off their bondage debts, were modern-day sex slaves,‚<U+0080>ù an indictment unsealed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Minnesota said, laying out criminal counts against a long list of defendants, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. Gregory Brooker, the acting United States attorney in Minnesota, described the ring as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a multimillion-dollar, modern-day organized crime operation.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to the eight-count indictment, the operation was intricate for its organization. Among those indicted were the people owed the bondage debts of the women brought from Bangkok. Others who were indicted served as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>house bosses‚<U+0080>ù in cities like Austin, Tex.; Chicago; Dallas; and Los Angeles, where they used apartments, hotels, houses and massage parlors for prostitution. Still others served as money launderers, putting cash returns into bank accounts, and facilitators, who took care of details like flying the women from city to city.While still in Thailand, the women were usually told that they would work as prostitutes, the indictment said, but the terms of the deals shifted substantially once they arrived in the United States. Threats were made. Bondage debts suddenly skyrocketed. Some women were even told to have plastic surgery to make them more ‚<U+0080><U+009C>appealing‚<U+0080>ù to customers, then ordered to reimburse the cost of surgery as part of their ever-growing debt.The authorities said the women were kept isolated and were not allowed to leave the prostitution houses without being accompanied by one of the ring organizers. The hours of prostitution often ran all day, every day.Officials said some of the women are now being helped by agencies to find housing and other assistance. But their immigration status in this country is uncertain; many were brought here with visas obtained using false information, the authorities said, including fictitious occupations and phony backgrounds. One of the main reasons women had accepted such deals in the first place, the officials said, was the promise of a legitimate visa.By Thursday, 20 of the 21 accused ‚<U+0080><U+0094> all of whom were described as organizers of the operation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had been arrested in various cities. More than a dozen others were arrested in connection with the ring last fall, officials said. In making the latest arrests in places like Chicago, Houston and San Diego, the authorities said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, along with cellphones, weapons and condoms. Lawyers for those arrested could not immediately be reached. Ten of the accused are Thai nationals; the rest are American citizens, the authorities said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Is this going to stop sex trafficking from going on? No,‚<U+0080>ù said Thomas J. Dart, the sheriff of Cook County, Ill., whose agency took part in the sprawling investigation. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no na√Øvet√© here. The notion that we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to eradicate this sort of thing is never going to happen until our society decides it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wrong.‚<U+0080>ùKat Sullivan was on a plane to Orlando, Fla., in February when she watched ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri‚<U+0080>ù for the first time, a movie about a woman who puts pressure on the local police to find her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s killer by renting out a series of giant advertising signs.That, Ms. Sullivan thought, was a good idea.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m getting a goddamn billboard,‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That woman totally epitomizes the feeling of just having to do something.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said that she was sexually abused and then raped by a former teacher when she was a student at the Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y., in the 1990s. A report commissioned by Emma Willard concluded that a teacher there named Scott Sargent had been fired for sexually abusing a student but was still given letters of recommendations to teach elsewhere; Ms. Sullivan was that student.Because the abuse took place 20 years ago, the statute of limitations has long since run out, leaving Ms. Sullivan with no legal recourse. So, using money from a settlement she received from the school, she bought a month‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth of ad space on three digital billboards, each about 50 feet wide, to call attention to the case.One billboard is in Albany, not far from Emma Willard. Another is on I-95 in Fairfield, Conn., near a school where Mr. Sargent later taught. The third is alongside I-90 in Springfield, Mass., near the town where Mr. Sargent lives today.Three images will rotate through each billboard. One points people to Ms. Sullivan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, and says, across a picture of a man with a question mark over his chest, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the truth will be revealed.‚<U+0080>ù Another is a picture of Ms. Sullivan and says: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My rapist is protected by New York state law. I am not. Neither are you. Neither are your children.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sullivan said the original design included Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and face, but that the company that owns the billboards would not allow her to use them, for fear of getting sued. Two billboard companies said they would not work with her at all.The three billboards will be up for 28 days, Ms. Sullivan said, which will cost her $14,000. (She spent about another $2,000 on the website.) Once the billboards come down, Mr. Sargent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name and photograph will appear on her website.Mr. Sargent did not respond to requests for comment.In a statement, Emma Willard said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We commend and support the survivors of sexual abuse who are committed to affecting change on this important issue.‚<U+0080>ùThe third graphic that will rotate through the billboards says ‚<U+0080><U+009C>NY Pass The Child Victims Act,‚<U+0080>ù a piece of proposed legislation in Albany that would give victims until age 28 to file criminal charges and allow them to sue until age 50. It would also create a one-year ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lookback‚<U+0080>ù window, during which cases from any time could proceed in court. Today, the statutes of limitations in New York that govern the sexual abuse of children are among the most restrictive in the country. Most adult survivors had until they were 23 years old, at the latest, to bring a case.Activist groups have been pushing the Child Victims Act in Albany for more than 10 years, and have made an especially aggressive effort this year, targeting specific state senators. Ms. Sullivan moved to New York City last month from her home in Florida to help lobby for the measure.Supporters are trying to make the act part of the state budget, which is due April 1 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a tactic that would give Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who supports the bill, more leverage to negotiate with legislators. The Child Victims Act has support from the State Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, but there is resistance to it in the Republican-controlled State Senate, which has blocked the bill for years. John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader, did not respond to questions about the legislation.A central sticking point is the lookback window. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said on Tuesday that any legislation that included it should be rejected and called the window ‚<U+0080><U+009C>toxic‚<U+0080>ù for the Catholic Church. Representatives of the church have said it supports changing the statute of limitations, but fears a flurry of lawsuits and the financial hit a lookback window might deliver.But proponents of the legislation have said that hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t happened in states that have enacted similar legislation, and they call the window crucial. In addition to providing victims their day in court, they said the window serves a public-safety function by flushing out suspected abusers who are still in the community.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The lookback window will help identify abusers, many of whom still have contact with kids,‚<U+0080>ù said State Senator Brad Hoylman, Democrat of Manhattan, who sponsored the bill in the Senate. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>New York has among the worst laws in the country on child sexual abuse. We are an outlier, so this fix is a long time coming.‚<U+0080>ùThe billboards strategy was used by activists in London pushing for arrests in the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people last year, who last month deployed three roving billboards to ask why there had been no arrests in the tragedy.Ms. Sullivan said she was motivated by the frustration that Mr. Sargent has faced no major consequences.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He is free to teach, free to coach, free to be elected onto boards,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are no blemishes on his record.‚<U+0080>ùEAST LANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The investigation began with the goal of uncovering how Michigan State University officials had failed to prevent Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar from assaulting hundreds of young women over decades. But the inquiry took a stunning turn on Tuesday when a university dean was accused not just of facilitating Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse, but of committing sexual misconduct himself.Dr. William D. Strampel, who worked as Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss at the College of Osteopathic Medicine, was accused by investigators of grabbing the buttocks of two female medical students. He suggested that one young woman leave school and become a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>centerfold model,‚<U+0080>ù investigators said. And he stored nude ‚<U+0080><U+009C>selfies,‚<U+0080>ù apparently of Michigan State students, on his work computer, court documents say, along with a video of Dr. Nassar performing ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treatment‚<U+0080>ù on a young patient.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As dean of the college, Strampel used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition and sexually assault female students,‚<U+0080>ù a detective from Michigan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statewide police agency wrote in an affidavit.The arrest of Dr. Strampel, who is 70 and was for 15 years the highest-ranking official at the osteopathic college, compounded the crisis facing Michigan State. It has seen its reputation devastated in recent months as scores of women recounted abuse by Dr. Nassar, a longtime university sports doctor. Women have described a corrupt culture at the university that diminished or ignored the complaints some of them made about Dr. Nassar as far back as the late 1990s. Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, Lou Anna K. Simon, left under pressure in January and trustees have faced calls to resign, even as the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigation into the university was expected to continue and additional charges were possible.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is another blow to the university,‚<U+0080>ù Tom Leonard, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, said of the charges against Dr. Strampel. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an absolute disgrace.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Strampel ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who stepped down in December from his job as dean, where he made more than $383,000 annually, according to MLive, a local news outlet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was charged with misconduct of a public official, a felony, and three misdemeanors, including fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of willful neglect of duty. Dr. Strampel was jailed on Monday, and appeared in court via video on Tuesday afternoon wearing a gray sweatshirt, his hands cuffed in front of him. A personal recognizance bond was set at $25,000, and Dr. Strampel was ordered not to contact current or former students, and not to leave the state.John Dakmak, a lawyer for Dr. Strampel, said his client planned to fight the charges and denied all of the counts against him.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My client denies that he ever engaged in any inappropriate touching of anyone, any student or otherwise,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Dakmak said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He denies that there was any quid pro quo for sexual favors in exchange for any type of standing within the university or the medical school.‚<U+0080>ùThe charges against Dr. Strampel come as prosecutors pursue a sprawling investigation of the university, which began after Dr. Nassar, a longtime physician for Michigan State and for U.S.A. Gymnastics, admitted sexually abusing young women and was sentenced to prison in hearings that drew international attention. Dozens of women, including Olympic gymnasts, described assaults committed under the guise of medical care. At least 265 people have said they were abused by Dr. Nassar.Prosecutors said Dr. Strampel failed to take steps to protect patients from Dr. Nassar when allegations of abuse emerged. He neglected, the prosecutors said, to follow a set of protocols that would, for instance, have required Dr. Nassar to conduct exams only with other staff members present. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Despite his representation of his (and the college‚<U+0080><U+0099>s) intended response to the allegations against Nassar, Strampel did not actually enforce or monitor these protocols, nor did he alert other employees in the Sports Medicine Clinic about the existence of the protocols,‚<U+0080>ù the charging documents said.The police detective‚<U+0080><U+0099>s affidavit outlining the charges also described a series of disturbing interactions between Dr. Strampel and four female medical students, none of whom were named publicly. In several of the cases, the women said they had gone to meet with Dr. Strampel to discuss their academic work but that he had turned the conversation to other topics.One woman who said she had been summoned to Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office after falling asleep in class said that he told her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>turn around in a circle twice so that he could observe her body,‚<U+0080>ù and that he said that she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>never going to make it in the profession if she did not dress sexier.‚<U+0080>ù When she was later called to a dinner honoring scholarship recipients at a club on Michigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s golf course, she said Dr. Strampel reached around and gripped her buttock as they posed for photos, according to the affidavit.Another student who had failed a medical school test said she was required to meet with Dr. Strampel, who asked her what her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Plan B‚<U+0080>ù was since ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she could not cut it in medical school.‚<U+0080>ù The student said Dr. Strampel told her he would do her a favor by letting her take the exam again, but that she would then be required to do anything for him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given the context,‚<U+0080>ù the affidavit said, the woman ‚<U+0080><U+009C>understood that she was being asked to do anything he wanted sexually in exchange for the favor.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, Dr. Nicole Eastman, who graduated from the school in 2010 and who said that she was interviewed by investigators in the case, said that Dr. Strampel made inappropriate sexual remarks, beginning soon after she started school in 2006.At one point, he told her, laughing and boasting, that it was easy to get women drunk, she said. Another time, she said, he grabbed her buttock at a crowded event, in full view of his wife, who was standing nearby.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I just remember how humiliating it was,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People knew about his behavior, and even if they weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t inappropriately touched by him, they knew. And now we know that his behavior enabled Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Eastman said she told a Michigan State employee while she was in school about Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior. The employee looked resigned, Dr. Eastman recalled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Everybody knows about his behavior and nothing ever changes,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Eastman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It seemed like a defeated kind of tone. When I think back to that, it was like she felt powerless.‚<U+0080>ùThe charging documents said Dr. Strampel also made graphic sexual comments, solicited nude photos from at least one student, and stored dozens of pornographic images and videos on a computer in his office, including many images that appeared to be of Michigan State students.Rachael Denhollander, who said Dr. Nassar abused her, said Tuesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s charges reflected a systemic failure at Michigan State.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is shocking but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not shocking,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Denhollander said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Someone like Larry doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get away with becoming the worst sexual abuser in history in plain sight if he were not surrounded by people who had no problem with his conduct and did not think it was a big deal.‚<U+0080>ùMichigan State‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interim president, John Engler, last month took steps to start the process of revoking Dr. Strampel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tenure. University officials did not answer questions Tuesday about the status of the revocation, and did not respond to a request to interview Mr. Engler.For years, university officials largely dismissed reports that Dr. Nassar had assaulted women, even though some women said they had reported abuse years ago to coaches, trainers or counselors.On Tuesday, State Senator Margaret O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien, a Republican, said ‚<U+0080><U+009C>this university needs to own up to what it did.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>This won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just go away,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Brien said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should know that by now.‚<U+0080>ùOn the campus of Michigan State, students said they were unsettled by the arrest of Dr. Strampel, who came to the College of Osteopathic Medicine in the 1990s after a career that included stints in the surgeon general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office and several hospitals.The college enrolls more than 1,200 students and graduates about 300 physicians each year. Graduates earn a D.O. degree instead of the more common M.D., but are full-fledged doctors able to prescribe medication, perform surgeries and choose any specialty. Students also study the osteopathic techniques of manipulating the spine, muscles and bones to diagnose and treat patients.Dr. Strampel, who could face up to nine years in prison if convicted of all charges, arrived at his home outside Lansing after his court appearance on Tuesday afternoon. A woman who came to the door declined to comment.Aly Raisman, an Olympic gymnast who said Dr. Nassar abused her, wrote on Instagram that the charges against Dr. Strampel were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yet another painful example‚<U+0080>ù of how so much had been mishandled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At this point, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clear that failing to investigate and understand how this abuse could go on for so long is just asking history to repeat itself,‚<U+0080>ù said Ms. Raisman, who called for a broader investigation ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that looks into everything, not just Nassar.‚<U+0080>ùAn American swimmer who competed in the 2012 Olympics has accused her former coach of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.The swimmer, Ariana Kukors, 28, said in a statement on Wednesday that the coach, Sean Hutchison, began sexually abusing her when she was 16 and had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>grooming‚<U+0080>ù her for three years before that.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Kukors said in the statement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement emailed by his lawyer, Mr. Hutchison, 46, said Thursday that the accusations were not true. He said that the two had had a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>committed relationship‚<U+0080>ù that began after she was of age and that they had lived together for more than a year after the 2012 Olympic Games.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to ‚<U+0080><U+0098>groom‚<U+0080><U+0099> her.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Her younger sister also lived with us for several months and her mother was a regular visitor to our home,‚<U+0080>ù the statement added. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I deeply regret that she would make these wild allegations all these years later.‚<U+0080>ùThe lawyer, Brad Meryhew, said Mr. Hutchison would not comment further.In response to Mr. Hutchison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, B. Robert Allard, one of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers, said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana was groomed and manipulated as a minor by her trusted swim coach. He sexually assaulted her starting when she was 16. This abusive relationship continued until the age of 24. I would hardly characterize this a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>committed relationship‚<U+0080><U+0099> in the sense of two consenting adults who freely and willingly engage in healthy relations. There is nothing healthy about childhood sexual abuse.‚<U+0080>ùThe United States Homeland Security Department is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>still in the very preliminary stages‚<U+0080>ù of an investigation into this case, Lori Haley, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in an email on Thursday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But our top priority in all cases involving alleged online child exploitation is identifying any possible minor victims.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Kukors once held the world record for the 200-meter individual medley and has won medals at several international competitions. She competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.Mr. Hutchison has worked with several Olympic swimmers, including the medalists Margaret Hoelzer, Caroline Burckle and Kara Lynn Joyce. He was an assistant coach for the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s swimming team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.He met Ms. Kukors when he was a coach at King Aquatic Club in Seattle, according to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement.In a statement on Thursday, Michael Brooks, the head coach at the club, said that news of the allegations ‚<U+0080><U+009C>broke our collective hearts.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ariana Kukors is part of the King Aquatic family and we only want the best for her,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Brooks said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our staff is meeting to review this devastating news. Sean Hutchison has stepped down as an executive with King and has had no direct interaction with our swimmers for a very long time.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Allard said that U.S.A. Swimming had been given notice in 2010 about the inappropriate coach-athlete relationship but had done nothing.U.S.A. Swimming, the organization that governs the sport in the United States, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>became aware of a rumored relationship between Hutchison and then 21-year-old Ariana via a third-party‚<U+0080>ù in 2010. (The organization said Mr. Hutchison does not work for the organization, but he once had a coach membership and remains a nonathlete member.)U.S.A. Swimming said that it conducted an investigation into the rumor in 2010, but that Ms. Kukors and Mr. Hutchison both ‚<U+0080><U+009C>unequivocally denied the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship,‚<U+0080>ù and the case was closed.In light of Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s allegations this week, the organization expressed support for her and other victims ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in their quest to break their silence and confront their horrific experiences.‚<U+0080>ùAccording to Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement, she realized that she had been abused only ‚<U+0080><U+009C>through recent therapy and after years of suppressing memories of the pain and suffering,‚<U+0080>ù and that she was coming forward with her story on the recommendation of victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> advocates.Ms. Kukors‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement follows on the heels of a dramatic sentencing hearing for Lawrence G. Nassar, a medical professional who was convicted of sexually abusing the young gymnasts, including Olympians, who were his patients. At least 265 girls and women have accused him of abuse, including while an F.B.I. inquiry into the allegations was underway.Uproar over the slow response to the allegations led the board of directors of U.S.A. Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the United States, to resign.The sexual misconduct allegations against the former Fox News host Bill O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly and the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the confidential settlements arising from those accusations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have prompted a provision in the  final tax bill that aims to stem the use of nondisclosure agreements.Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, proposed the amendment last month. It says any settlement, payout or lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse could not be deducted as a business expense if such payments were subject to a nondisclosure agreement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think most Americans would be outraged to know that they are subsidizing sexual predators in the tax code,‚<U+0080>ù he said in an emailed statement.But the proposed changes may not deter some companies and businesses from seeking confidentiality.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is a nudge, not a hammer,‚<U+0080>ù Daniel Hemel, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an expert in tax policy, said in a phone interview on Saturday.Publicly known sexual harassment settlements involving Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Reilly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who is said to have used nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> have totaled about $45 million, including a $32 million payout that he paid personally.Mr. Weinstein, whose abuse of women was exposed by The New York Times in October, also has used confidentiality agreements. The Times reported that Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment.Under the tax bill spearheaded by Republicans, a hypothetical company that paid a $10 million sexual abuse settlement would not be able to take a deduction on that amount if the payout had a nondisclosure agreement attached to it.In the absence of a confidentiality agreement, however, the new corporate tax rate would allow the company to save $2.1 million in taxes, making its out-of-pocket cost $7.9 million.For a business that generates billions in revenue, like the parent company of Fox News, a nondisclosure agreement can have far more value than tax savings.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The new rules are very well-intentioned, but the impact is likely to only be symbolic,‚<U+0080>ù Gordon Klein, a lawyer, certified public accountant and faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Anderson School of Management, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The reason for that is companies cherish nondisclosure agreements because they significantly help protect the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation and protect them from follow-on lawsuits or additional lawsuits.‚<U+0080>ùThe nonspecific language of the amendment also complicated matters, Mr. Klein said.The bill refers to settlements or payments ‚<U+0080><U+009C>related‚<U+0080>ù to sexual harassment or sexual abuse, he said, but what if only one portion of the allegations is about sexual harassment? And does it matter if the sexual harassment was merely an allegation, or does there need to be evidence of sexual harassment? Are the lawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fees limited to the time spent drafting the settlement, or to all of the fees associated with the settlement?Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, proposed a similar amendment for the House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tax reform bill but it did not include a stipulation about confidentiality agreements.In the end, the language in the Senate bill offered by Mr. Menendez made the final cut when lawmakers blended the two bills together. Democrats have heavily criticized the proposed tax bill and complained they were shut out of the legislative process.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think the reason, in all honestly, why there was no pushback was because it was a revenue generator,‚<U+0080>ù Tricia Enright, Mr. Menendez‚<U+0080><U+0099>s press secretary, said in a phone interview on Saturday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They determined that it would be seen on the plus-side of the ledger.‚<U+0080>ùWhile the new tax plan would allow businesses to write off legal fees related to sexual harassment payouts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> provided they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not tied to nondisclosure agreements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it is a different situation for employees who make claims of sexual abuse or harassment.In those cases, plaintiffs will no longer be able to write off their legal fees. A plaintiff could ordinarily claim such an expense as an itemized deduction, but the Republican plan has eliminated that option, Mr. Hemel said, adding that it creates ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a one-sidedness.‚<U+0080>ùROME ‚<U+0080><U+0094> After his spirited defense of a Chilean bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse prompted the greatest crisis of his pontificate, Pope Francis reactivated an abuse commission on Saturday that had lapsed into dormancy.It was the latest in a series of measures by the Vatican to counter criticism that fighting abuse was not a priority for Francis‚<U+0080><U+0099> papacy.Cardinal Sean O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley of Boston was reappointed as the leader of the group, called the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. A Vatican statement said the panel would include some victims of clerical sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm,‚<U+0080>ù Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley said in a statement.The Vatican statement said the abuse victims on the commission preferred to keep their histories private.The first, three-year mandate of the commission ended in December, and its lapsing coincided with growing criticism of the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment to addressing sexual abuse in the church. The group plans to begin its work in April by hearing the testimony of abuse victims.The Vatican statement said the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s goal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and greatest challenge‚<U+0080>ù remained embedding ‚<U+0080><U+009C>abuse prevention and protection into the life and action of local churches.‚<U+0080>ùThe announcement about the commission came on the same day that the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most experienced sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, was expected to take testimony in New York from Juan Carlos Cruz, who says that he was sexually abused when he was a teenager in Chile by a priest and that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had witnessed the abuse.While visiting Chile last month, the pope initially defended Bishop Barros as a victim of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>calumny,‚<U+0080>ù saying that the Vatican had received no concrete evidence against the bishop.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,‚<U+0080>ù Francis said at the time. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander.‚<U+0080>ùThe comments caused outrage in Chile, and Francis, amid intense pressure, dispatched Archbishop Scicluna to investigate.On Thursday, the Civilt√† Cattolica, a Jesuit journal, published the private remarks the pope made during a visit to Peru last month, in which he disclosed that he regularly met with victims of sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Holy Father meets victims of sexual abuse, either individually or in groups, several times a month,‚<U+0080>ù Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman, confirmed in a statement. He added that the pope ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tries to help them heal the grave wounds caused by the abuses they suffered.‚<U+0080>ùMany advocates for abuse survivors accused the pope of opening up a wound by saying there was no evidence that Bishop Barros had covered up abuse. It then emerged that the pope had personally received an eight-page letter in 2015 containing testimony against the bishop, and that Cardinal O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley had delivered it.Eight members of the commission were reappointed, and nine others are new to the panel. Its experts, which include lay academics and psychologists, priests and nuns, come from several countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Tonga. Ten are non-clerics and eight are women, including three nuns.Two abuse survivors previously left the commission in frustration. And the pope did not reappoint six lay members who advocates for the abused considered among the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most active leaders.CHARLOTTE, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Back in court Wednesday for his third and final sentencing hearing, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports clinic doctor, heard statements from more than 20 accusers, many of whom shared accounts of sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar at a local gymnastics club known for grooming stars.Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accusers include elite athletes, such as the Olympic medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas. But the speakers in court on Wednesday were not global superstars. They were mostly regular teenagers who told of being charmed by Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strange laugh‚<U+0080>ù and by the autographed posters of revered gymnasts on the walls of his office at the Michigan State sports clinic.Twistars Gymnastics Club, outside Lansing, Mich., was supposed to catapult young female athletes to a fruitful career, under the guidance of John Geddert, who owned the gym and coached there. Instead it became a site of anguish and devastation, according to the statements, some of which described long-lasting injuries, both mental and physical, inflicted by the doctor known as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>healer of gymnasts.‚<U+0080>ùLast week, more than 150 young women and teenagers finished publicly confronting Dr. Nassar during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. He has received sentences of 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography and of 40 to 175 years for the sexual abuse charges in Ingham County.Starting Wednesday, 65 women were scheduled to speak here in Eaton County Circuit Court this week. The judge, Janice K. Cunningham, said that the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265, some of whom chose to remain anonymous.Unlike the Ingham County judge, Rosemarie E. Aquilina, whose frequent commentary throughout the hearing there was met with a mix of praise and disapproval, Judge Cunningham kept her comments concise and subdued, primarily expressing appreciation for the victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> bravery.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is almost beyond comprehension to listen to young women in high school to stand at that podium and come forward with their story,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Dr. Nassar, wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, remained stoic with his head hanging low throughout the first day of the hearing, which included statements from 29 of the accusers, 22 of whom had not previously offered a statement in Ingham County.The first speaker, Jessica Thomashow, said she had been assaulted by Dr. Nassar as early as age 9, at Twistars.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The way it worked at Twistars was that, if you were injured, you were specifically instructed to see Larry Nassar, not your family doctor,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Thomashow said. She recalled being excited to see the famed Dr. Nassar for a rib injury.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I went into the back room and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s when everything changed,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to the room Dr. Nassar used at Twistars.Another victim, Bailey Lorencen, whose statement was read for her, referred to Twistars‚<U+0080><U+0099> back room as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>dungeon.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is clear that in an environment like Twistars, a monster like Nassar would thrive,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lorencen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement said.Dr. Nassar pleaded guilty here in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13, according to a plea agreement.The agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011, some of it under the guise of medical treatment. A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars.Dr. Nassar will be sentenced after the victims speak. The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the counts.The case has reverberated in the sports world, and it led to the resignation of the entire U.S.A. Gymnastics board of directors.At Michigan State, the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president, after the longtime president Lou Anna Simon resigned last week. But Mr. Engler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appointment has already been met with student protests, and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s faculty senate is debating a vote of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no confidence‚<U+0080>ù in the board. The vote could come as soon as next week.The stories told Wednesday by the young women and by athletes‚<U+0080><U+0099> parents, some of whom had been in the room while Dr. Nassar abused their daughters, painted an image of a dark side in gymnastics culture. Many of the victims said the pressure to rise in the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ranks had contributed to their decisions not to report the abuse sooner.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I kept thinking, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a doctor, stop overreacting,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Katherine Ebert said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t overreacting.‚<U+0080>ùMadison Bonofiglio, whose statement was read by Angela Povilaitis, the assistant attorney general, said she had dismissed her feelings while she was being abused for fear of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>upsetting‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are judged by your body, your looks, your cuteness factor, and then your skill,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said.The young women said that they were told they had no choice but to see Dr. Nassar and that he had lulled them into trusting him. He lit the fireplace to keep athletes warm when ‚<U+0080><U+009C>treating‚<U+0080>ù them in his basement, where the abuse often occurred, they said. Dr. Nassar often gave gifts, such as souvenir pins, necklaces and treats, according to some of the statements.Amy Preston, the mother of a 19-year-old who was abused by Dr. Nassar as a child, said he had brought the girl waffles with fresh berries and whipped cream. He often consoled gymnasts when Mr. Geddert screamed at them, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>John, you tried to teach our girls to be quiet and obey,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Preston said in court, apparently referring to Mr. Geddert. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We now stand before them and say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Speak.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A. sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University, formally opening an investigation into how the university handled the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, the doctor who sexually assaulted scores of female athletes.Dr. Nassar spent decades on the faculty at the university and treated its athletes, as well as members of the United States national gymnastics team.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has requested information from Michigan State about any potential rules violations,‚<U+0080>ù Donald M. Remy, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief legal officer, said in a phone interview Tuesday evening.N.C.A.A. bylaws require colleges to protect the health, safety and well-being of athletes. Among those who have said Dr. Nassar abused them are members of the Michigan State cross country and softball teams. Kathie Klages, the former gymnastics coach who retired last year, has been accused of seeking to cover up allegations against Dr. Nassar, who served as team physician for the university gymnastics and women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crew programs.In a statement late Tuesday, the association said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The N.C.A.A. has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential N.C.A.A. rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State. We will have no further comment at this time.‚<U+0080>ùA Michigan State spokesman said Tuesday night that the university was reviewing the letter before issuing a response.On Wednesday, Michigan State released the N.C.A.A‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter, which was addressed to Athletic Director Mark Hollis and copied to President Lou Anna Simon. Referring to Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>heinous and appalling assaults,‚<U+0080>ù it cited the principle of athlete wellbeing and a by-law that it said pertained to that principle.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Larry Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s heinous crimes of record against more than 150 victims raise serious concerns about institutional practices, student-athlete safety and the institution‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions to protect individuals from his behavior.‚<U+0080>ùIn a statement Wednesday, Hollis pledged a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>comprehensive response‚<U+0080>ù to the letter and the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooperation. Of college athletes, he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our first priority has always been and will always be their health and safety.‚<U+0080>ùThe N.C.A.A., the governing body of intercollegiate athletics, was widely criticized several years ago for its handling of a case involving Penn State University in which Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant football coach, sexually abused young boys. (Sandusky is serving a decades-long prison term.)Less than a year after the Penn State scandal became public in the fall of 2011, an independent investigation commissioned by Penn State, and led by Louis J. Freeh, helped lead to N.C.A.A. sanctions, including a $60 million fine and the vacating of more than 100 wins from the lifetime record of the former head coach Joe Paterno, who died earlier that year. Several of the penalties were later rescinded, and the wins restored.Critics contended that the N.C.A.A. had overstepped its bounds with those penalties. Emails made public because of a lawsuit two years later appeared to show N.C.A.A. officials questioning whether their institution had the authority to issue such penalties on a university, even one where several high-ranking officials later received jail time for their roles in covering up Mr. Sandusky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse.In one email, an N.C.A.A. official referred to the consent decree between the association and Penn State as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bluff‚<U+0080>ù and urged a settlement because the N.C.A.A.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chances of proving a violation of its bylaws before a Committee on Infractions might prove difficult.Last year, an N.C.A.A. Committee on Infractions demonstrated just how narrow those bylaws can be when it declined to penalize the University of North Carolina over a scandal in which scores of dubious classes were taken disproportionally by football and men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s basketball players. Through gritted teeth, the committee said it could not find an N.C.A.A. violation because the classes had been available to all students.The Nassar case has drawn comparisons to the Sandusky case, raising questions about how university officials responded to warning signs about federal crimes being committed on their campus and about whether they tried to protect someone who was considered valuable to the athletics program. The Michigan State University police received a report about Dr. Nassar as early as May 2014, and on Tuesday a former rower at Michigan State said she had received no response to two separate reports of abuse by Nassar.Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon, a former chair of what is now known as the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors, has faced calls for resignation, though the university‚<U+0080><U+0099>s board has largely supported her.The Nassar case has been pushed further into the national spotlight over the past week as Judge Rosemarie Aquilina has allowed more than 140 women, and others connected to the case, to speak at a sentencing hearing for Dr. Nassar, who has pleaded guilty to multiple sex crimes and has already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. On Monday, three leading members of the board of U.S.A. Gymnastics, which also employed Dr. Nassar for years, resigned amid increasing criticism of how they responded to reports of his abuse.Several voices ordinarily critical of the N.C.A.A. have urged the organization to stay away from the allegations against Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are always mindful of the voices around college athletics,‚<U+0080>ù Remy said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and we strive to do the right thing.‚<U+0080>ùAt the N.C.A.A. Convention last week in Indianapolis, Mark Emmert, the association‚<U+0080><U+0099>s president, conspicuously did not mention Michigan State in his annual address, even as he alluded to the U.N.C. scandal and the under-the-table payments in men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s college basketball that federal officials revealed last fall. Emmert told members of the news media at the convention that he did not have enough information on what happened at Michigan State to comment on it in-depth.However, in his address Emmert rebutted the notion that the N.C.A.A. should steer clear of controversy.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dance around those things,‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to various scandals. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t make excuses for it. We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say our process is slow.‚<U+0080>ùHe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do we respond? I think, first of all, by not retreating from it, not getting under our desks not hiding from it.‚<U+0080>ùLANSING, Mich. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Armed with pieces of paper etched with their memories of sexual abuse, they stepped forward, one by one ‚<U+0080><U+0094> nearly 100 of them, with more to come.For four full days this week, in a fluorescent-lighted courtroom here, women and girls ‚<U+0080><U+0094> some of them the best gymnasts in the country, others with dreams prematurely crushed, they said, by a man who now sat in handcuffs 10 feet away ‚<U+0080><U+0094> leaned into a microphone to address him, sometimes through sobs, sometimes with screams, but always with determination.Aly Raisman, 23, who won gold medals at the past two Summer Olympics, told of late-night knocks on her hotel door while she was competing overseas, as the man, Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, then the team doctor, arrived to abuse her.A teammate at the 2012 London Games, Jordyn Wieber, who until Friday had not identified herself as a victim of Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, recalled the torment of the Games, where she was a part of the American team that won a gold medal but, she said, had to submit to his care under the auspices of the sport‚<U+0080><U+0099>s governing body, U.S.A. Gymnastics.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our bodies were all hanging by a thread in London,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Who was the doctor that U.S.A.G. sent? The doctor who was our abuser.‚<U+0080>ùFor other young athletes just striking out, there seemed little they could do but give in, buckling under the pressure of knowing so many stars had seemingly benefited from him. And so a young gymnast named Chelsea Zerfas, now 15, spoke of anguished probing, under the guise of treatment, face down on an exam room table when she was 13, feeling helpless to challenge a doctor at that age.The occasion of the hearing, to help a judge decide Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prospective sentence on state charges of nearly a dozen sexual assaults, appeared almost beside the point. He had been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on a child pornography conviction, and the judge in this state court hearing has said that Dr. Nassar, 54, who has pleaded guilty to several sexual-assault charges, can expect to spend the rest of his life in prison.But before then, she allowed so-called victim impact statements from the 140 girls and women whom prosecutors accuse Dr. Nassar of abusing, leading to days of wrenching testimony here that has evolved into not only a nationally televised reckoning of his crimes but an indictment of a sport that his victims say did little to protect them.At the same time, the hearing has dovetailed with the continued expansion of the #MeToo movement that seeks to hold predatory men to account ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in this case, in excruciating detail.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Come hell or high water, we will find a way to take every last one of you down that could have stopped this monster,‚<U+0080>ù said Amy Labadie, a former gymnast who testified Friday morning. She added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to see into the future and not think this will affect me forever.‚<U+0080>ùSome of the victims described how the team doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions spawned suicidal thoughts and ruptured their families, how they hoped he would rot in prison, and how they desperately wanted the blame and repercussions to extend far beyond him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to the people and the organizations that turned a blind eye.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Imagine feeling like you have no power and no voice,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Raisman said Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Well, you know what, Larry? I have both power and voice, and I am only just beginning to use them. All these brave women have power, and we will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: a life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Nassar pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault, and his sentencing hearing, which began Tuesday, is now expected to continue next week, as the number of women who have wanted to speak in court has grown, from 88 to 105 to 120, at last count ‚<U+0080><U+0094> emboldened by what has happened here this week. Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she had cleared her docket.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are all superheroes,‚<U+0080>ù the judge said Friday morning after one of the victims, choking back tears, read her statement.Dr. Nassar entered the courtroom at 9:04 a.m. He wore a dark blue prison uniform. After he reached the witness box, where he has sat with a hangdog expression since the hearing began, he appeared to recognize that Ms. Raisman and Ms. Wieber were seated together in the front row. Dr. Nassar looked down and slowly shook his head.Ms. Wieber, 22, was the first person to testify on Friday ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but the 69th to have her statement heard since the proceedings began. Ms. Wieber said Dr. Nassar began treating her when she was 8. Like many of those who came before her, Ms. Wieber said that Dr. Nassar had manipulated her by bringing her food and coffee at pressure-cooker training camps where such luxuries were prohibited.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody was protecting us from being taken advantage of,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Wieber said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody was ever concerned whether or not we were being sexually abused.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Raisman took clear aim at both U.S.A. Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee when she appeared in court on Friday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Neither U.S.A. Gymnastics nor the U.S.O.C. have reached out to express sympathy or even offer support,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not even to ask: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>How did this happen? What do you think we can do to help?‚<U+0080><U+0099> Why have I and others here, probably, not heard anything from the leadership at the U.S.O.C.? Why has the United States Olympic Committee been silent? Why isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the U.S.O.C. here right now?‚<U+0080>ùMark Jones, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said in a statement that it first became aware of the possibility that a physician with the gymnastics federation had been abusing athletes in 2015.‚<U+0080><U+009C>At that time, U.S.A. Gymnastics indicated that they were in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement agencies,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Jones said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are heartbroken that this abuse occurred, proud of the brave victims that have come forward and grateful that our criminal justice system has ensured that Nassar will never be able to harm another young woman.‚<U+0080>ùAt the same time, Mr. Jones said, the Olympic committee will continue to press for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>meaningful change‚<U+0080>ù in the gymnastics federation.The federation announced on Thursday that it would cut ties with Karolyi Ranch, a renowned training facility that was one of the places where Dr. Nassar molested the gymnasts.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The development camp taking place through Sunday is the last U.S.A. Gymnastics activity at the Ranch,‚<U+0080>ù the federation said in a statement on Friday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Next week‚<U+0080><U+0099>s training camp for the U.S. women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s national team is canceled and the Acro World Team Trials scheduled for the first week in February has been relocated.‚<U+0080>ùKara Johnson, now a high school student, spoke about how she was taken to Dr. Nassar for back and hip treatment when she was a 13-year-old runner. Dr. Nassar, she said, placed her on a table on her stomach and then molested her. She described how he left the room, returned with a lubricant and repeated the abuse. He then smacked her on her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bare butt,‚<U+0080>ù called her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sweetie‚<U+0080>ù and told her that if she ever had her period when she came to see him, to be sure to let him know, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>How was I supposed to know at the age of 13 what was medically acceptable and what the boundaries were?‚<U+0080>ù she said.Her sister Madeline was also abused. Now 15, she told the court that as a 12-year-old gymnast, she was sent to Dr. Nassar for back treatment and underwent the same abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At only 12 years old, I had no idea that it was inappropriate, illegal and wrong,‚<U+0080>ù she said.On Thursday, McKayla Maroney, 22, another Olympic gymnast, said she had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>scars‚<U+0080>ù that might never heal after being abused by Dr. Nassar, starting when she was 13 or 14.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dr. Nassar was not a doctor,‚<U+0080>ù she said in a statement read for her by a prosecutor. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. End of story.‚<U+0080>ùThe impact of the trial, and Dr. Nassar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history of assault, is spreading well beyond the courtroom. Michigan State University, which employed Dr. Nassar, was also facing increasing pressure after revelations that 14 people, including the president, Lou Anna K. Simon, had been warned about his conduct.Ms. Raisman added that she had not been planning to speak in court ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was scared and nervous,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but decided to add her name to the list once she began listening to the impact statements that were delivered earlier this week.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My dream,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>is that one day everyone will know what the words ‚<U+0080><U+0098>me, too‚<U+0080><U+0099> signify, but they will be educated and able to protect themselves from predators like Larry so that they will never, ever, ever have to say the words, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>me, too.‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ùThe room filled with applause as Ms. Raisman thanked the judge and backed away from the microphone. More women were waiting their turn.Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s third-highest-ranking official, arrived at a Melbourne court on Monday for the start of several weeks of hearings to determine whether he will face trial on charges of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ùPolice officers lined the sidewalk, as a large contingent of the local and international journalists and members of the public watched the cardinal enter the Melbourne Magistrates‚<U+0080><U+0099> Court.The slow-moving case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> charges were filed in June ‚<U+0080><U+0094> will be a test of both Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s justice system and the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to hold clerics accountable after decades of abuse scandals. Witness testimony began on Monday and is expected to continue for two weeks, during which time the court will be closed to the news media and the public.Here is a guide to what we know, what we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and how the case will be shaped by Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s court system.The son of a Catholic mother and an Anglican father, George Pell grew up in Ballarat, a mining town northwest of Melbourne, where he also served as a priest from 1971 to 1984.During that time, accusations of abuse by priests swirled through the area, but Cardinal Pell later said that he had no memory of hearing about specific substantiated cases of sexual abuse.His rise through the church was swift. He became bishop of Melbourne in 1996. Less than a year later, he formed the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Melbourne Response,‚<U+0080>ù a process to investigate local accusations of sexual abuse against Catholic clergymen.More than a dozen priests accused of abuse stepped down during Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time in Melbourne, but he also protected the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. The Melbourne Response capped payouts to victims at 50,000 Australian dollars ($38,000), far below what victims in other countries would later receive.In 2007, he was appointed to a council of cardinals assigned to improve the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finances. In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s treasurer and its third most senior figure.Last June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.Cardinal Pell appeared in court on Monday wearing a black suit and clerical collar and did not speak during the initial session.Read:  How Cardinal Pell Rose to Power, Trailed by a Cloud of ScandalRead:  George Pell, Aide to Pope, Is Put on Defensive in Abuse InquiryCardinal Pell has been charged with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>historical sexual offenses.‚<U+0080>ù No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.Cardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and ‚<U+0080><U+0099>80s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses. However, nothing has been made public about the details ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not the number of accusers, not the time frame of the accusations, nor the severity of the acts at the center of the case.What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,‚<U+0080>ù he said at a news conference in Rome last June.During Monday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hearing, the prosecution requested amendments to certain charges and requested that emotional support dogs be available to witnesses who testified via video link.Read: Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual AssaultRead: Vatican Sex Abuse Scandal Reveals Blind Spot for Francis Expected to run for four weeks, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committal hearing will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to take the case to trial.All relevant evidence will be presented to the magistrate by the prosecution, including witness testimony.Local news outlets have reported that up to 50 witnesses could be called during the hearing process. The court heard last year that some of the witnesses were choir boys at the time of the alleged incidents.All witnesses can be subject to cross-examination by the defense ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a noteworthy detail because Robert Richter, the cardinal‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, has a reputation for a withering and aggressive approach.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We want to demonstrate that what was alleged was impossible,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Richter told the court last October.Even if the magistrate decides that there is not sufficient evidence to proceed, Victoria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.The hearing‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proceedings are largely conducted outside of public view. Reporters are being granted access for the first day of the hearing but will not be allowed to return to cover actual testimony.Read:  Cardinal George Pell Returns to Australia, Charged With Sexual OffensesAustralian law tends to be more favorable to defendants, and proceedings more secretive, than in the United States.The country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s contempt standards prohibit reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after charges have been filed and before a verdict has been reached ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that might be seen as prejudicial against or for a defendant.Depending on the type of offense, journalists cannot publish information on a wide range of topics including: specific accusations against an individual, prior convictions and affiliations with convicted criminals, and material that might be deemed unreasonably favorable to a defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case.All news media organizations in Australia are subject to this restriction, which has the potential to create vast differences in articles about the case published from inside or outside Australia.Suppression orders are also used in many cases to further restrict what journalists can report in Australia, placing details that appear in court records off limits.In rare cases, even the existence of a suppression order can be banned from publication, meaning that journalists cannot report precisely why certain details are missing from their coverage. These are sometimes referred to as superinjunctions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quite often, orders will be made to protect the fairness of the defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s trial,‚<U+0080>ù said Jason Bosland, a law professor at the University of Melbourne, whose research has focused on court proceedings. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the main purpose of an order.‚<U+0080>ùBut, he added, such orders are often approved without rigorous scrutiny about whether they are in fact necessary.In a report published before Cardinal Pell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case began, Mr. Bosland wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Open justice is increasingly being undermined in Victoria due to the inappropriate use of suppression orders by the courts.‚<U+0080>ùIn an interview, he added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem in Australia is that the courts tend to make orders that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t comply with the strict requirements of the law.‚<U+0080>ùRead:  Suppression Orders Vs. Open JusticeThe call to Pittsburgh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hotline for child abuse and neglect came in at 3:50 p.m. on the Wednesday after Thanksgiving 2016. Sitting in one of 12 cubicles, in a former factory now occupied by the Allegheny County Police Department and the back offices of the department of Children, Youth and Families, the call screener, Timothy Byrne, listened as a preschool teacher described what a 3-year-old child had told him. The little girl had said that a man, a friend of her mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, had been in her home when he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hurt their head and was bleeding and shaking on the floor and the bathtub.‚<U+0080>ù The teacher said he had seen on the news that the mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boyfriend had overdosed and died in the home.According to the case records, Byrne searched the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer database for the family, finding allegations dating back to 2008: parental substance abuse, inadequate hygiene, domestic violence, inadequate provision of food and physical care, medical neglect and sexual abuse by an uncle involving one of the girl‚<U+0080><U+0099>s two older siblings. But none of those allegations had been substantiated. And while the current claim, of a man dying of an overdose in the child‚<U+0080><U+0099>s home, was shocking, it fell short of the minimal legal requirement for sending out a caseworker to knock on the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s door and open an investigation.Before closing the file, Byrne had to estimate the risk to the child‚<U+0080><U+0099>s future well-being. Screeners like him hear far more alarming stories of children in peril nearly every day. He keyed into the computer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Low risk.‚<U+0080>ù In the box where he had to select the likely threat to the children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s immediate safety, he chose ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No safety threat.‚<U+0080>ùHad the decision been left solely to Byrne ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as these decisions are left to screeners and their supervisors in jurisdictions around the world ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that might have been the end of it. He would have, in industry parlance, screened the call out. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what happens to around half of the 14,000 or so allegations received each year in Allegheny County ‚<U+0080><U+0094> reports that might involve charges of serious physical harm to the child, but can also include just about anything that a disgruntled landlord, noncustodial parent or nagging neighbor decides to call about. Nationally, 42 percent of the four million allegations received in 2015, involving 7.2 million children, were screened out, often based on sound legal reasoning but also because of judgment calls, opinions, biases and beliefs. And yet more United States children died in 2015 as a result of abuse and neglect ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 1,670, according to the federal Administration for Children and Families; or twice that many, according to leaders in the field ‚<U+0080><U+0094> than died of cancer.This time, however, the decision to screen out or in was not Byrne‚<U+0080><U+0099>s alone. In August 2016, Allegheny County became the first jurisdiction in the United States, or anywhere else, to let a predictive-analytics algorithm ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the same kind of sophisticated pattern analysis used in credit reports, the automated buying and selling of stocks and the hiring, firing and fielding of baseball players on World Series-winning teams ‚<U+0080><U+0094> offer up a second opinion on every incoming call, in hopes of doing a better job of identifying the families most in need of intervention. And so Byrne‚<U+0080><U+0099>s final step in assessing the call was to click on the icon of the Allegheny Family Screening Tool.After a few seconds, his screen displayed a vertical color bar, running from a green 1 (lowest risk) at the bottom to a red 20 (highest risk) on top. The assessment was based on a statistical analysis of four years of prior calls, using well over 100 criteria maintained in eight databases for jails, psychiatric services, public-welfare benefits, drug and alcohol treatment centers and more. For the 3-year-old‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family, the score came back as 19 out of a possible 20.Over the course of an 18-month investigation, officials in the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Office of Children, Youth and Families (C.Y.F.) offered me extraordinary access to their files and procedures, on the condition that I not identify the families involved. Exactly what in this family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s background led the screening tool to score it in the top 5 percent of risk for future abuse and neglect cannot be known for certain. But a close inspection of the files revealed that the mother was attending a drug-treatment center for addiction to opiates; that she had a history of arrest and jail on drug-possession charges; that the three fathers of the little girl and her two older siblings had significant drug or criminal histories, including allegations of violence; that one of the older siblings had a lifelong physical disability; and that the two younger children had received diagnoses of developmental or mental-health issues.Finding all that information about the mother, her three children and their three fathers in the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maze of databases would have taken Byrne hours he did not have; call screeners are expected to render a decision on whether or not to open an investigation within an hour at most, and usually in half that time. Even then, he would have had no way of knowing which factors, or combinations of factors, are most predictive of future bad outcomes. The algorithm, however, searched the files and rendered its score in seconds. And so now, despite Byrne‚<U+0080><U+0099>s initial skepticism, the high score prompted him and his supervisor to screen the case in, marking it for further investigation. Within 24 hours, a C.Y.F. caseworker would have to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>put eyes on‚<U+0080>ù the children, meet the mother and see what a score of 19 looks like in flesh and blood.For decades, debates over how to protect children from abuse and neglect have centered on which remedies work best: Is it better to provide services to parents to help them cope or should the kids be whisked out of the home as soon as possible? If they are removed, should they be placed with relatives or with foster parents? Beginning in 2012, though, two pioneering social scientists working on opposite sides of the globe ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Emily Putnam-Hornstein, of the University of Southern California, and Rhema Vaithianathan, now a professor at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand ‚<U+0080><U+0094> began asking a different question: Which families are most at risk and in need of help? ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People like me are saying, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You know what, the quality of the services you provide might be just fine ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it could be that you are providing them to the wrong families,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080><U+0089>‚<U+0080>ù Vaithianathan told me.Vaithianathan, who is in her early 50s, emigrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand as a child; Putnam-Hornstein, a decade younger, has lived in California for years. Both share an enthusiasm for the prospect of using public databases for the public good. Three years ago, the two were asked to investigate how predictive analytics could improve Allegheny County‚<U+0080><U+0099>s handling of maltreatment allegations, and they eventually found themselves focused on the call-screening process. They were brought in following a series of tragedies in which children died after their family had been screened out ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the nightmare of every child-welfare agency.One of the worst failures occurred on June 30, 2011, when firefighters were called to a blaze coming from a third-floor apartment on East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. When firefighters broke down the locked door, the body of 7-year-old KiDonn Pollard-Ford was found under a pile of clothes in his bedroom, where he had apparently sought shelter from the smoke. KiDonn‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 4-year-old brother, KrisDon Williams-Pollard, was under a bed, not breathing. He was resuscitated outside, but died two days later in the hospital.The children, it turned out, had been left alone by their mother, Kiaira Pollard, 27, when she went to work that night as an exotic dancer. She was said by neighbors to be an adoring mother of her two kids; the older boy was getting good grades in school. For C.Y.F., the bitterest part of the tragedy was that the department had received numerous calls about the family but had screened them all out as unworthy of a full investigation.Incompetence on the part of the screeners? No, says Vaithianathan, who spent months with Putnam-Hornstein burrowing through the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s databases to build their algorithm, based on all 76,964 allegations of maltreatment made between April 2010 and April 2014. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What the screeners have is a lot of data,‚<U+0080>ù she told me, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite difficult to navigate and know which factors are most important. Within a single call to C.Y.F., you might have two children, an alleged perpetrator, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have Mom, you might have another adult in the household ‚<U+0080><U+0094> all these people will have histories in the system that the person screening the call can go investigate. But the human brain is not that deft at harnessing and making sense of all that data.‚<U+0080>ùShe and Putnam-Hornstein linked many dozens of data points ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just about everything known to the county about each family before an allegation arrived ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to predict how the children would fare afterward. What they found was startling and disturbing: 48 percent of the lowest-risk families were being screened in, while 27 percent of the highest-risk families were being screened out. Of the 18 calls to C.Y.F. between 2010 and 2014 in which a child was later killed or gravely injured as a result of parental maltreatment, eight cases, or 44 percent, had been screened out as not worth investigation.According to Rachel Berger, a pediatrician who directs the child-abuse research center at Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Hospital of Pittsburgh and who led research for the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, the problem is not one of finding a needle in a haystack but of finding the right needle in a pile of needles. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All of these children are living in chaos,‚<U+0080>ù she told me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How does C.Y.F. pick out which ones are most in danger when they all have risk factors? You can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe the amount of subjectivity that goes into child-protection decisions. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s why I love predictive analytics. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finally bringing some objectivity and science to decisions that can be so unbelievably life-changing.‚<U+0080>ùThe morning after the algorithm prompted C.Y.F. to investigate the family of the 3-year-old who witnessed a fatal drug overdose, a caseworker named Emily Lankes knocked on their front door. The weathered, two-story brick building was surrounded by razed lots and boarded-up homes. No one answered, so Lankes drove to the child‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preschool. The little girl seemed fine. Lankes then called the mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cellphone. The woman asked repeatedly why she was being investigated, but agreed to a visit the next afternoon.The home, Lankes found when she returned, had little furniture and no beds, though the 20-something mother insisted that she was in the process of securing those and that the children slept at relatives‚<U+0080><U+0099> homes. All the appliances worked. There was food in the refrigerator. The mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disposition was hyper and erratic, but she insisted that she was clean of drugs and attending a treatment center. All three children denied having any worries about how their mother cared for them. Lankes would still need to confirm the mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story with her treatment center, but for the time being, it looked as though the algorithm had struck out.Charges of faulty forecasts have accompanied the emergence of predictive analytics into public policy. And when it comes to criminal justice, where analytics are now entrenched as a tool for judges and parole boards, even larger complaints have arisen about the secrecy surrounding the workings of the algorithms themselves ‚<U+0080><U+0094> most of which are developed, marketed and closely guarded by private firms. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a chief objection lodged against two Florida companies: Eckerd Connects, a nonprofit, and its for-profit partner, MindShare Technology. Their predictive-analytics package, called Rapid Safety Feedback, is now being used, the companies say, by child-welfare agencies in Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Early last month, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services announced that it would stop using the program, for which it had already been billed $366,000 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in part because Eckerd and MindShare refused to reveal details about what goes into their formula, even after the deaths of children whose cases had not been flagged as high risk.The Allegheny Family Screening Tool developed by Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein is different: It is owned by the county. Its workings are public. Its criteria are described in academic publications and picked apart by local officials. At public meetings held in downtown Pittsburgh before the system‚<U+0080><U+0099>s adoption, lawyers, child advocates, parents and even former foster children asked hard questions not only of the academics but also of the county administrators who invited them.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re trying to do this the right way, to be transparent about it and talk to the community about these changes,‚<U+0080>ù said Erin Dalton, a deputy director of the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s department of human services and leader of its data-analysis department. She and others involved with the Allegheny program said they have grave worries about companies selling private algorithms to public agencies. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s concerning,‚<U+0080>ù Dalton told me, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>because public welfare leaders who are trying to preserve their jobs can easily be sold a bill of goods. They don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have a lot of sophistication to evaluate these products.‚<U+0080>ùAnother criticism of such algorithms takes aim at the idea of forecasting future behavior. Decisions on which families to investigate, the argument goes, should be based solely on the allegations made, not on predictions for what might happen in the future. During a 2016 White House panel on foster care, Gladys Carri√≥n, then the commissioner of New York City‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, expressed worries about the use of predictive analytics by child-protection agencies. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It scares the hell out of me,‚<U+0080>ù she said ‚<U+0080><U+0094> especially the potential impact on people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s civil liberties. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am concerned about widening the net under the guise that we are going to help them.‚<U+0080>ùBut in Pittsburgh, the advocates for parents, children and civil rights whom I spoke with all applauded how carefully C.Y.F. has implemented the program. Even the A.C.L.U. of Pennsylvania offered cautious praise. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re putting important checks on the process,‚<U+0080>ù said Sara Rose, a Pittsburgh lawyer with the organization. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re using it only for screeners, to decide which calls to investigate, not to remove a child. Having someone come to your home to investigate is intrusive, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not at a level of taking a child away or forcing a family to take services.‚<U+0080>ùThe third criticism of using predictive analytics in child welfare is the deepest and the most unsettling. Ostensibly, the algorithms are designed to avoid the faults of human judgment. But what if the data they work with are already fundamentally biased? There is widespread agreement that much of the underlying data reflects ingrained biases against African-Americans and others. (Just last month, the New York City Council voted to study such biases in the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s use of algorithms.) And yet, remarkably, the Allegheny experience suggests that its screening tool is less bad at weighing biases than human screeners have been, at least when it comes to predicting which children are most at risk of serious harm.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a conundrum,‚<U+0080>ù Dalton says. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>All of the data on which the algorithm is based is biased. Black children are, relatively speaking, over-surveilled in our systems, and white children are under-surveilled. Who we investigate is not a function of who abuses. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a function of who gets reported.‚<U+0080>ùIn 2015, black children accounted for 38 percent of all calls to Allegheny County‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maltreatment hotline, double the rate that would be expected based on their population. Their rate of being placed outside their home because of maltreatment was even more disproportionate: eight out of every 1,000 black children residing in the county were placed outside their home that year, compared with just 1.7 of every 1,000 white children.Studies by Brett Drake, a professor in the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, have attributed the disproportionate number of black families investigated by child-welfare agencies across the United States not to bias, but to their higher rates of poverty. Similarly, a 2013 study by Putnam-Hornstein and others found that black children in California were more than twice as likely as white children there to be the subject of maltreatment allegations and placed in foster care. But after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, she showed that poor black children were actually less likely than their poor white counterparts to be the subject of an abuse allegation or to end up in foster care.Poverty, all close observers of child welfare agree, is the one nearly universal attribute of families caught up in the system. As I rode around with caseworkers on their visits and sat in on family-court hearings, I saw at least as many white parents as black ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but they were all poor, living in the county‚<U+0080><U+0099>s roughest neighborhoods. Poorer people are more likely not only to be involved in the criminal-justice system but also to be on public assistance and to get their mental-health or addiction treatment at publicly funded clinics ‚<U+0080><U+0094> all sources of the data vacuumed up by Vaithianathan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and Putnam-Hornstein‚<U+0080><U+0099>s predictive-analytics algorithm.Marc Cherna, who as director of Allegheny County‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Department of Human Services has overseen C.Y.F. since 1996, longer than just about any such official in the country, concedes that bias is probably unavoidable in his work. He had an independent ethics review conducted of the predictive-analytics program before it began. It concluded not only that implementing the program was ethical, but also that not using it might be unethical. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is hard to conceive of an ethical argument against use of the most accurate predictive instrument,‚<U+0080>ù the report stated. By adding objective risk measures into the screening process, the screening tool is seen by many officials in Allegheny County as a way to limit the effects of bias.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We know there are racially biased decisions made,‚<U+0080>ù says Walter Smith Jr., a deputy director of C.Y.F., who is black. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are all kinds of biases. If I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m a screener and I grew up in an alcoholic family, I might weigh a parent using alcohol more heavily. If I had a parent who was violent, I might care more about that. What predictive analytics provides is an opportunity to more uniformly and evenly look at all those variables.‚<U+0080>ùFor two months following Emily Lankes‚<U+0080><U+0099>s visit to the home of the children who had witnessed an overdose death, she tried repeatedly to get back in touch with the mother to complete her investigation ‚<U+0080><U+0094> calling, texting, making unannounced visits to the home. All her attempts went without success. She also called the treatment center six times in hopes of confirming the mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sobriety, without reaching anyone.Finally, on the morning of Feb. 2, Lankes called a seventh time. The mother, she learned, had failed her three latest drug tests, with traces of both cocaine and opiates found in her urine. Lankes and her supervisor, Liz Reiter, then sat down with Reiter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss and a team of other supervisors and caseworkers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is never an easy decision to remove kids from home, even when we know it is in their best interest,‚<U+0080>ù Reiter told me. But, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When we see that someone is using multiple substances, we need to assure the children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s safety. If we can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get into the home, that makes us worry that things aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t as they should be. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a red flag.‚<U+0080>ù The team decided to request an Emergency Custody Authorization from a family-court judge. By late afternoon, with authorization in hand, they headed over to the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s home, where a police officer met them.The oldest child answered their knock. The mother wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t home, but all three children were, along with the mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s elderly grandfather. Lankes called the mother, who answered for the first time in two months and began yelling about what she considered an unwarranted intrusion into her home. But she gave Lankes the names of family members who could take the children for the time being. Clothing was gathered, bags packed and winter jackets put on. Then it was time for the children to get in the car with Lankes, a virtual stranger empowered by the government to take them from their mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s care.At a hearing the next day, the presiding official ordered the mother to get clean before she could have her children returned. The drug-treatment center she had been attending advised her to enter rehab, but she refused. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get in touch with her very often,‚<U+0080>ù Reiter recently told me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty clear she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not in a good place. The two youngest kids are actually with their dads now. Both of them are doing really, really well.‚<U+0080>ù Their older brother, age 13, is living with his great-grandfather.In December, 16 months after the Allegheny Family Screening Tool was first used, Cherna‚<U+0080><U+0099>s team shared preliminary data with me on how the predictive-analytics program was affecting screening decisions. So far, they had found that black and white families were being treated more consistently, based on their risk scores, than they were before the program‚<U+0080><U+0099>s introduction. And the percentage of low-risk cases being recommended for investigation had dropped ‚<U+0080><U+0094> from nearly half, in the years before the program began, to around one-third. That meant caseworkers were spending less time investigating well-functioning families, who in turn were not being hassled by an intrusive government agency. At the same time, high-risk calls were being screened in more often. Not by much ‚<U+0080><U+0094> just a few percentage points. But in the world of child welfare, that represented progress.To be certain that those results would stand up to scrutiny, Cherna brought in a Stanford University health-policy researcher named Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert to independently assess the program. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My preliminary analysis to date is showing that the tool appears to be having the effects it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s intended to have,‚<U+0080>ù Goldhaber-Fiebert says. In particular, he told me, the kids who were screened in were more likely to be found in need of services, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>so they appear to be screening in the kids who are at real risk.‚<U+0080>ùHaving demonstrated in its first year of operation that more high-risk cases are now being flagged for investigation, Allegheny‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Family Screening Tool is drawing interest from child-protection agencies around the country. Douglas County, Colo., midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, is working with Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein to implement a predictive-analytics program there, while the California Department of Social Services has commissioned them to conduct a preliminary analysis for the entire state.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Given the early results from Pittsburgh, predictive analytics looks like one of the most exciting innovations in child protection in the last 20 years,‚<U+0080>ù says Drake, the Washington University researcher. As an author of a recent study showing that one in three United States children is the subject of a child-welfare investigation by age 18, he believes agencies must do everything possible to sharpen their focus.Even in Illinois, where B.J. Walker, the director of the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Department of Children and Family Services, is terminating its contract with the companies that developed Rapid Safety Feedback, predictive analytics is not dead. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I still believe it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a good tool to make better informed decisions,‚<U+0080>ù Walker told me in December. Walker knows Cherna and Dalton and saw the long process they went through to develop the Family Screening Tool. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing a careful job,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Their transparency has been laudable. And transparency isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t often your friend, because you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to make some mistakes, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to stumble, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to make changes.‚<U+0080>ùCherna and Dalton are already overseeing a retooling of Allegheny County‚<U+0080><U+0099>s algorithm. So far, they have raised the program‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accuracy at predicting bad outcomes to more than 90 percent from around 78 percent. Moreover, the call screeners and their supervisors will now be given less discretion to override the tool‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recommendations ‚<U+0080><U+0094> to screen in the lowest-risk cases and screen out the highest-risk cases, based on their professional judgment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to change the mind-set of the screeners,‚<U+0080>ù Dalton told me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a very strong, dug-in culture. They want to focus on the immediate allegation, not the child‚<U+0080><U+0099>s future risk a year or two down the line. They call it clinical decision-making. I call it someone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s opinion. Getting them to trust that a score on a computer screen is telling them something real is a process.‚<U+0080>ùULAANBAATAR ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Thousands of Mongolians protested in front of parliament in Ulaanbaatar on Saturday to demand more action to prevent child abuse, after the widely-reported rape of a male infant shocked the country.After the reported rape earlier this month in Dornogobi province in Mongolia's southeast, a group of concerned mothers created a Facebook group announcing the Saturday protest last week, and it quickly reached more than 400,000 members.""We want to show child abusers that we are strong in order to protect our children,"" said Davaa Baatar, 41, the father of three children who was attending the protest.The protesters held placards with messages such as ""Stop child abuse"", ""No child rape"" and ""Our children, our future"".The protest organizers are demanding stricter laws regarding child abuse, better government services for survivors and more public awareness.""We will give our policy demands to the parliament, government and the president's office on Monday,"" said Odontuya Tsolmon, one of the protest organizers.The government has promised a response.""As soon as we get the proposed demands from organizers, the cabinet will be open to discuss it,"" a government spokesman told Reuters, adding that the prime minister's advisors were at the demonstration.Some group members have advocated for the death penalty for sex offenders, though the protest organizers said they were opposed to capital punishment.President Khaltmaa Battulga formed a commission to reinstate capital punishment for such crimes last year after similar widely-publicised incidents of child sexual assaults provoked a public outcry.According to the state prosecutors office, there were 298 reported incidents of child rape in 2015 and 2016. Experts believe this is a small proportion of actual incidents of child sexual abuse due to a pervasive cultural stigma over the topic.""The fear of being blamed and shamed means victims and their families keep quiet and don't report to the police,"" Ganbayasgakh Geleg, a founder of the Gender Equality Centre which fights human trafficking and sexual violence, told Reuters.Mongolia, a thinly populated and mineral-rich country of just three million people sandwiched between Russia and China, transitioned to a parliamentary democracy in 1990 having previously been a satellite of the Soviet Union.But there has been continued public frustration about the economy, corruption and air pollution, among other issues.Last year, a slump in foreign investment and declining commodity prices forced Mongolia to agree to a $5.5 billion bailout led by the International Monetary Fund to relieve fiscal strains and try to restore investor confidence.(Reporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav and Peter Bittner; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Tom Hogue)BERLIN ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  German authorities have arrested a man suspected of sexually abusing two children and posting thousands of images and videos of his crimes online.The arrest early Tuesday came less than a day after federal police published photos of the suspect and called for the public's help in identifying him.Frankfurt prosecutors said the 45-year-old, whose name wasn't released, was arrested at a hotel in the western city of Krefeld. Police tracked him down there after searching his apartment in nearby Viersen and seizing evidence.The man is suspected of sexually abusing at least two boys, aged about 7 and 10, in Germany since October 2014. Prosecutors say the material was posted in December 2017 on a pedophile platform on the darknet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> part of the internet accessible only with identity-shielding software.SYDNEY, Australia ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A royal commission investigating the sexual abuse of children in Australia found Friday that the nation was gripped by an epidemic dating back decades, with tens of thousands of children sexually abused in schools, religious organizations and other institutions.The commission, the highest form of investigation in Australia, urged government action on its 189 recommendations, including the establishment of a new National Office for Child Safety and penalties for those who suspect abuse and fail to alert the police, including priests who hear about abuse in confessionals. It also urged Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Roman Catholic leadership to press Rome to end mandatory celibacy for priests.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tens of thousands of children have been sexually abused in many Australian institutions,‚<U+0080>ù said the report, which was particularly critical of Catholic organizations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will never know the true number. Whatever the number, it is a national tragedy, perpetrated over generations within many of our most trusted institutions.‚<U+0080>ùPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said all Australians should read the report.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to thank and honor the courage of the survivors and their families who‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve told, often for the first time, the dreadful stories of abuse that they received from people who actually owed them love and protection,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Turnbull said.The commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chairman, Justice Peter McClellan, said that the panel heard from more than 1,000 witnesses over nearly 15 months in assessing the magnitude of the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is not a case of a few rotten apples,‚<U+0080>ù the report said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Society‚<U+0080><U+0099>s major institutions have seriously failed. In many cases those failings have been exacerbated by a manifestly inadequate response to the abused person. The problems have been so widespread, and the nature of the abuse so heinous, that it is difficult to comprehend.‚<U+0080>ùAustralia created the commission in 2012 to investigate decades of sexual abuse in religious institutions, schools and other establishments ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the only country in the world so far to initiate such a sweeping government-led inquiry. More than 4,000 institutions have been implicated in abuse allegations, the commission found.Australian government investigators identified 4,444 victims of abuse and at least 1,880 suspected abusers from 1980 to 2015. Most of those suspected of abuse were Catholic priests and religious brothers. The report released Friday said 62 percent of the survivors who told the commission they were abused in religious institutions were abused in a Catholic facility.Responding to the findings, Archbishop Denis Hart of Melbourne offered ‚<U+0080><U+009C>our unconditional apology for this suffering and a commitment to ensuring justice for those affected.‚<U+0080>ùHe said many of the panel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recommendations would have a significant impact on the way the Catholic Church operates in Australia.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Central to this Royal Commission is the painful truth that so many children were abused, trust was destroyed and innocence lost,‚<U+0080>ù the archbishop said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are sons and daughters, brothers and sisters ‚<U+0080><U+0094> this should never have happened. As a bishop I express my deepest sorrow.‚<U+0080>ùThe inquiry, which cost the Australian government 373 million Australian dollars, or $286 million, was unmatched in its scope in examining a scandal that has shaken the Roman Catholic hierarchy worldwide.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Our inquiry revealed numerous cases where leaders of religious institutions knew about allegations of child sexual abuse but failed to take effective action, often with catastrophic consequences for children,‚<U+0080>ù the report said.The most damaging revelations about child sexual abuse have centered on scandals in towns like Ballarat, the hometown of Cardinal George Pell, who this year became the highest-ranking Roman Catholic prelate to be formally charged with sexual offenses.In Ballarat, a police officer investigated a pedophile ring at local Catholic schools and said up to 30 victims had since committed suicide.The charges brought in June against Cardinal Pell, one of Pope Francis‚<U+0080><U+0099> top advisers, followed years of criticism that he had at best overlooked, and at worst covered up, the widespread abuse of children by clergymen in Australia.In addition to calling for the establishment of a National Office for Child Safety, the commission urged passage of laws that penalize those who fail to alert the police if they suspect an adult ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was sexually abusing or had sexually abused a child.‚<U+0080>ùDelving into sensitive territory for the Catholic Church, the report recommended that clergy be required to report suspected abuse that they hear in the confessional booth. Church officials, however, argue that confidentiality is integral to the ritual, and Archbishop Hart took issue with the proposal.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would feel terribly conflicted, and I would try even harder to get that person outside confessional, but I cannot break the seal,‚<U+0080>ù he said, referring to the seal of absolute secrecy around what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s said in the confessional. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The penalty for any priest breaking the seal is excommunication, being cast out of the church, so it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a real, serious, spiritual matter,‚<U+0080>ù he added.The panel also recommended that the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference pressure the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leadership in Rome to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>consider introducing voluntary celibacy for diocesan clergy,‚<U+0080>ù saying that mandatory celibacy for priests contributed to child abuse.On that front, Archbishop Hart said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I certainly will see that the bishops pass on that recommendation to the Holy See and they will then decide.‚<U+0080>ù But he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I believe that there are real values in celibacy.‚<U+0080>ùFormer Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who had called for the establishment of the royal commission, said that previous efforts to conduct such an inquiry faced resistance, despite efforts by whistle-blowers to expose the abuses.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Increasingly as more and more survivors came forward, the question became, how do we respond to this?‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There were a number of factors to consider that troubled me quite deeply.‚<U+0080>ùShe said Australians have been shocked not only by the range of the abuse that has been brought to light, but the systematic nature of the cover-ups.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It has already changed the nation,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Gillard said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Never again can we be na√Øve about the depth and breadth of this problem.‚<U+0080>ùVATICAN CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094> For a church hierarchy excoriated for decades over the sexual abuse of children in its trust, hosting a conference this week about the spreading scourge of online child pornography was an opportunity to strike a positive note about the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s role in protecting minors.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yes, yes, yes,‚<U+0080>ù said Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s secretary of state, when asked Tuesday night at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome if the Catholic Church could lead a global response to the problem.But in an awkward confluence of events, the four-day congress, Child Dignity in the Digital World, is taking place mere weeks after the Holy See recalled Msgr. Carlo Capella, a church diplomat in the Vatican Embassy in Washington, amid accusations that he had possessed child pornography.It was just the latest of the abuse accusations against priests that have dogged the church around the globe for decades even as it has promised to punish predators and protect the preyed upon. Advocates for the victims have questioned the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commitment.Last week, as organizers prepared for the congress ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with its keynote address by Cardinal Parolin, the second-highest-ranking official after Pope Francis; blanket coverage by the church‚<U+0080><U+0099>s news media; and a papal audience with Francis on Friday ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Canadian police issued an arrest warrant for Monsignor Capella. He was accused of distributing child pornography during a Christmas visit in 2016 to Ontario.Cardinal Parolin, speaking to reporters on Tuesday before his address, called the case a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>very painful affair, a great trial for all those who are involved.‚<U+0080>ù He said the priest‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case was being handled with the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>utmost seriousness.‚<U+0080>ù The Vatican has also said that the Holy See‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief prosecutor was investigating and that if the monsignor was tried and convicted, he could be sentenced up to 12 years in a Vatican jail.The Vatican has done much to address child abuse by clergy members, which has threatened to stain the entire church. (Pope Benedict XVI once memorably called it ‚<U+0080><U+009C>filth.‚<U+0080>ù) It has removed abusive priests, worked more closely with local law enforcement officials, toughened its laws and generally adopted a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>zero tolerance‚<U+0080>ù approach.But advocates for victims have argued that the Vatican‚<U+0080><U+0099>s invocation of diplomatic immunity to recall the Italian monsignor from the United States shows that it still prioritizes protecting its own.In his speech before top Italian officials and representatives from Interpol, the United Nations, Russia, China, the United States, Facebook and Microsoft, Cardinal Parolin spoke at length about the growing threat of internet abuse on the spirit and psyches of young users. He acknowledged that when it came to the exploitation and abuse of children, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>over the past few decades, this tragic reality has come powerfully to the fore in the Catholic Church, and extremely grave facts have emerged.‚<U+0080>ùLast month, Francis said in unscripted remarks to a commission he had created to advise him on the issue that the church had ‚<U+0080><U+009C>arrived late‚<U+0080>ù to the crisis. He lamented his leniency, early in his pontificate, toward an Italian priest who subsequently continued his abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,‚<U+0080>ù the pope said. He said he would limit the chances of pedophile priests to appeal their convictions by church tribunals.But critics say Vatican action has lagged behind the pope‚<U+0080><U+0099>s words. For example, a tribunal to discipline bishops who cover up abuse was disbanded because, the pope said, the Vatican already had the requisite offices to deal with the issue.A commission Francis created with top cardinals, outside experts and abuse victims (the committee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s only two victims have since left) has seemed stifled by Vatican bureaucracy.And the pope brought  Cardinal George Pell to Rome as a top adviser despite allegations of abuse against him. The cardinal is now back in Australia facing charges of sexual assault against minors.Advocates for abuse victims say they consider the Capella case a shameful echo of an earlier episode involving Josef Wesolowski, a Polish archbishop accused of abusing children in the Dominican Republic, where he served as the Vatican ambassador. The Vatican removed the archbishop and denied appeals that he be tried in the Dominican Republic. He was defrocked and died in the Vatican before facing justice.The Rev. Hans Zollner, a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, said he was confident that this time, the accused cleric would face justice.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everyone who commits a crime needs to be punished,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Period.‚<U+0080>ùThe congress, meanwhile, is seeking ways to protect children in what has been depicted as a frightening digital world, where abusers surf a dark web and child pornography proliferates.The conference has included top experts in the field speaking about the risks as more children in developing countries go online. They have discussed troubling statistics, such as the finding last year by the Internet Watch Foundation that more than 57,000 websites contained images of children being sexually abused. And they have sat on panels such as one called International Politics and Law Regarding Child Sexual Abuse.For years, top Vatican officials in Rome had dismissed the abuse crisis as a unique product of the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggested that it had been overplayed by the news media. But organizers of the congress said the majority of the experts came from countries in the global north because that is where the problem has been confronted most aggressively.In an interview, Father Zollner said that on his global travels looking into the problem, he had observed that bishops and clerics in countries such as Malawi were finally facing an issue they would not talk about as recently as a year ago. But other nations are still constrained by local cultural taboos about discussing child abuse, he said.Italy, he noted, was not without its own bombshell reports of sexual abuse in the church. He compared the book ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lust,‚<U+0080>ù about abuse in the Vatican, by the investigative journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi, to the breakthrough reports by The Boston Globe‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Spotlight team on the cover-up of priests‚<U+0080><U+0099> sexual abuse of children.Father Zollner he said the media focus on Monsignor Capella could have a positive side effect and put ‚<U+0080><U+009C>more attention to the topic of the congress,‚<U+0080>ù which, he said, was to better understand the phenomenon of child pornography and how to prevent it.‚<U+0080><U+009C>That is our whole purpose,‚<U+0080>ù he said.CRIMES OF THE FATHER By Thomas Keneally 334 pp. Atria. $26.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was a bad priest, he knew it.‚<U+0080>ù Graham Greene‚<U+0080><U+0099>s whiskey priest risks his life to celebrate Mass in anticlerical Mexico. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an enemy of the state, a man of God and the great hero of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Power and the Glory.‚<U+0080>ù Father Frank Docherty, the protagonist of Thomas Keneally‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new novel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crimes of the Father,‚<U+0080>ù is a bad priest to some and a good one to others, and he certainly knows it. Sent away from his native Sydney in 1972 by an archbishop who found Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political activism and theological liberalism unacceptable, he is by the 1990s a psychologist and a professor in Canada. Under those auspices, he researches the sexual abuse of children and minors by the clergy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew the suspicion he attracted from his brethren in the wider priesthood. He was a priest who ponced around academia all week, dealing with unhealthy and distasteful subjects, and helped out at a local parish on the weekend ‚<U+0080><U+0094> how graceful of him!‚<U+0080>ùFor his 36th novel, Keneally has chosen a subject that is by now painfully familiar to both Roman Catholics and the wider public. The main action takes place in Sydney in 1996 and concerns the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding Irish population. This is a time and place and community in which those abused are just beginning to come forward more boldly, while church leaders and the faithful more broadly are themselves only just starting to reckon more openly with longstanding patterns of institutional failure, corruption and concealment. As he returns to Sydney to lecture on his research, resume complicated friendships and seek permission from the current archbishop to celebrate Mass again in his native archdiocese, Docherty becomes involved in an intertwined series of private and public revelations.For obvious reasons, Keneally admires his protagonist. As such, Docherty is not especially interesting, for he rarely seems genuinely unsure of himself. Whether he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preparing to confront an elite clergyman and his superior with evidence of the clergyman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse or trying to deal with once strong, now reheated feelings for a married woman, his struggles come across as stylized, even romantically heroic. You can be damned sure, mate, that tough-and-tender ol‚<U+0080><U+0099> Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to do the difficult thing, and do it well, no matter the odds.The novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far more distinctive and well-wrought character is Sarah Fagan, the Sydney cabdriver who picks up Docherty at the airport upon his return. Through intensely told flashback sequences, Keneally brings out the confusion and pain teenage Sarah experiences when she comes under the influence of Father Leo Shannon, a rising young star in the archdiocese. Under the guise of hiring her as his office assistant, Shannon makes Fagan feel privileged, even blessed, to spend secret time doing secret things with him. When he coolly rejects her for other girls, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she felt the jolt of this news, and a sickening bewilderment in the pit of her stomach; the extreme sentiments of the rejected.‚<U+0080>ùFrom this brilliant, brutal rendering of Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victimization, Keneally traces out her jagged trajectory through a convent childhood, university studies, a teaching career and assorted vocational and spiritual spinouts, and finally into her very tentative alliance with Docherty. This last happens to coincide with Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confrontation with Shannon himself, now a key adviser to the archbishop in legal proceedings concerning another abuse case. The heroism and villainy that play out thereafter is suspenseful, if predictable. Far more powerfully felt is Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unexpected expression of thanks to Docherty, near the novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end, for a favor he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done her, which has made possible both personal renewal and public justice. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What favor is that?‚<U+0080>ù the priest asks. Her answer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You believed me.‚<U+0080>ùI‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sure that I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve forgotten some of the clich√©s and nonsense stuffed into ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Book of Henry,‚<U+0080>ù but here‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a partial list: a sensitive child genius; a comically dysfunctional family; an overwhelmed single mother; a sassy waitress with a tattoo on her breast played by a name comedian; children acting like parents; parents acting like children; a young, beautiful female victim; the predator next door; an incompetent (but not unkind!) school bureaucrat; a fatal diagnosis; a ticking clock; a race against the clock; a cute doctor played by a TV actor whose name is on the tip of your tongue; and a female star who deserves far better.A weepie, a thriller, a tragedy, a sub-Spielbergian pastiche, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Book of Henry‚<U+0080>ù is mostly a tedious mess. It was directed by Colin Trevorrow and written by Gregg Hurwitz, and I suggest you skip it or catch it on streaming or on the back of an airplane seat, where presumably it will soon be playing. You may like a few things, especially Jaeden Lieberher, who plays Henry with real feeling and deserves a long career. But you may wonder how long Jacob Tremblay, who was so good in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Room,‚<U+0080>ù will be cast for his tremulousness. And you may also, after stifling your yawns, hope that the next time you see Naomi Watts it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s in a movie that plays to her strengths and doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t treat her or the audience so contemptuously.New York City‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commissioner of child welfare could not say no.On a recent visit to a new family services center in the Bronx, employees urged the commissioner, David A. Hansell, to take a seat in the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>selfie chair.‚<U+0080>ù The new center is for struggling families looking for guidance and support, and the selfie chair is a way for parents and their children to show themselves some love as they enter the building.Mr. Hansell, 64, pulled his cellphone from his suit jacket pocket, extended his arm, smiled and took his portrait.For a year now since he was appointed to lead the Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, he has thrust himself into a spotlight. He has met frequently with employees and elected officials, and he has sat down with parents whose children have been removed from their family homes and placed in foster care.Mr. Hansell has set out to improve the agency by hiring hundreds of additional employees and updating technology within the agency. But just as important to Mr. Hansell has been repairing the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s image.With 7,200 employees and a $3.2 billion budget, the agency is a key part of the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s social safety net. But the nature of its work means much of what it does happens outside the public eye. When the child welfare agency does end up in the news, it is almost always because a child has died and the agency is found to have come up short in its mission.Contending with the reputation that flows from such failures, and from the role the agency plays in removing at-risk children from their homes, often compounds the challenges the agency faces. Families can be less inclined to trust the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s workers, and politicians can be less forthcoming with the funding the agency may need.Mr. Hansell knows the agency has scant room for error, and that it is often perceived as intimidating, incompetent, or both. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I think a lot about what incredible power the agency has, the power to separate a family and to take a child away, and how you have to make sure you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re using that power for good and not for ill,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Hansell said.Under Mr. Hansell the agency has increased training, and it has added 600 new child protective workers since September, with another 400 set to come on board by the end of June. The agency has also expanded the duties of investigators, retired police detectives who generally research the backgrounds of families and go out on high-risk cases that involve domestic violence and children under 7.Mr. Hansell already has drawn criticism from outside child-welfare experts who fault him for a 13 percent rise in children removed from their homes and placed in foster care. He said that increase corresponded with an increase in reports following a succession of children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s deaths in 2016.And he has to manage an ethics conflict stemming from his last job, as a managing director at the consulting firm KPMG, where he was in charge of the social services arm. KPMG has $2 million in contracts with the Administration for Children‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Services, to work on some of the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s juvenile justice efforts. When he joined the agency, he sent a letter to the chief contracting officer recusing himself from any financial decisions dealings with KPMG.The child welfare job has long been one of the hotter seats in city government, and that ended up being true for Mr. Hansell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s predecessor, Gladys Carri√≥n. Facing fierce criticism, she announced her retirement in December 2016 after the deaths of two children that illuminated understaffing, poor training of workers and lapses in child protection investigations.Mr. Hansell said he drew lessons from her tenure, and concluded that she kept too low a profile. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So when things got bad, she had no public image and there was nothing else to give any context to what was happening,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That also sort of framed for me the importance of being out there as a visible symbol of the agency.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Carri√≥n doubted that high visibility could insulate an agency that inevitably comes under fire. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The question is, what does that buy you at the end?‚<U+0080>ù she asked. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There will always be champions that will work with you. There will always be people who, when anything goes wrong, are going to be the naysayers that will go after you.‚<U+0080>ùThe agency has a contract with Rise, a nonprofit that advocates for parents, to train some of the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s employees on how to better engage with families.Jeanette Vega, a training director at Rise and a mother whose children were once removed by city child welfare, recalled how Mr. Hansell attended a picnic that celebrated parents and children reuniting. The event did not receive the same promotion as an adoption fair, but Ms. Vega said she appreciated Mr. Hansell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s presence. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was in shorts and T-shirt,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Mr. Hansell grew up in Cleveland. His mother was a social worker and psychologist, and his father was a lawyer who served as a legal adviser in the State Department and was involved in human and civil rights.Mr. Hansell initially followed in his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps by working as a sixth-grade teacher with an eye on becoming a child psychologist. But he switched gears, went to law school and began a career in Washington as an aide in the Senate.Concerned about the issues of gay men like himself, Mr. Hansell left government and became legal director and a deputy executive director of the Gay Men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Health Crisis in New York. He returned to government, first locally and then with the Department of Health and Human Services under President Barack Obama.Mr. Hansell has said he wants to see a day when parents view the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s child welfare agency as a resource.The selfie chair was at the entrance of O.U.R. Place, a community center made possible with $450,000 from the agency. There were no plans to publicize the financial affiliation with the agency, for fear of dissuading families from seeking help there.Within the agency, Mr. Hansell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s frequent face time with employees is as much about increasing morale as it is about listening to concerns.Before Mr. Hansell visited O.U.R. Place, his first stop in a packed schedule was the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Harlem office, the center of the 2016 tragedy that helped fuel his predecessor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s departure.Three employees were fired, four were demoted and two were suspended after the death of 6-year-old Zymere Perkins in September 2016. Zymere‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother and her boyfriend were charged in the boy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fatal beating, but state and city reviews showed that employees failed to talk to doctors, relatives and other people who came into contact with Zymere‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family. An independent monitor, ordered by the state, reviewed operations in the wake of Zymere‚<U+0080><U+0099>s death. Kroll Associates, hired as the monitor, issued a report in December that concluded that inconsistent compliance with policies, poor access to technology and understaffing had led to failures.Mr. Hansell has visited all 17 of the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s field offices but has more frequently visited the Harlem office. A conference room was so packed during his recent visit that employees sat on filing cabinets and dragged in chairs from their desks. They raised concerns about everything from the bureaucracy and paperwork involved in distributing MetroCards to indigent families to proposed state budget cuts.The commissioner has been meeting with state legislators to try to prevent what could add up to $129 million in cuts in 2019 in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s budget proposal. The agency cannot afford reductions, he said. Retention has long been a problem: About 40 percent of child welfare workers leave within the first two years of hiring.The agency is putting a special focus on new hires, but it is also trying to make the jobs of all employees easier. The agency has spent about $6 million to get tablets that have talk-to-text capability to 2,425 employees so they can do work in the field instead of having to return to an office.Showing up has endeared Mr. Hansell to many employees, said Anthony Wells, president of Social Service Employees Union Local 371. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reachable. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s accessible. You can have a conversation with him. He understands government,‚<U+0080>ù he said.NAIROBI ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A Kenyan opposition politician said on Thursday he was beaten and drugged by officials then deported despite a court order to free him, in the latest twist of a legal tussle that has been condemned by rights groups.Miguna - who holds dual Canadian citizenship - and his lawyer said was put on a flight to Dubai late on Wednesday two days after he was detained arriving at Nairobi's main airport. The interior ministry said it would comment later.The reports come as a particularly sensitive time in Kenya as President Uhuru Kenyatta and his opposition rival Raila Odinga have been trying to settle months of turmoil since contested elections in October.The standoff over Miguna, a member of the opposition, risks reigniting tensions and has already set Kenya's government on a collision course with the judiciary.Kenya's interior minister and police chief were found guilty of contempt of court on Wednesday and fined a day later for ignoring a judge's order to free Miguna.High court judge George Odunga said on Thursday both men had ""conducted themselves in a most despicable manner not expected in this constitutional era"" - an unprecedented rebuke of such senior figures.""FLAGRANT DEFIANCE""Miguna was originally arrested after he appeared at a staged ""swearing-in"" ceremony of opposition leader Raila Odinga in January - an event meant as a public challenge to Kenyatta.He was deported in February as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>prohibited immigrant‚<U+0080>ù - the authorities said he had lost Kenyan nationality under a now-defunct law.A court then ruled he should be allowed back with his Kenyan citizenship reinstated, but he was detained again when he arrived in Nairobi's main airport on Monday, he and his lawyer said.A court ordered his release and then, when his detention continued, found both Interior minister Fred Matiang'i and police inspector general Joseph Boinnet guilty of contempt of court, then fined them each 200,000 Kenyan shillings (1,416 pounds) for ignoring its ruling.The minister would appeal, his spokesman said. There was no immediate comment from the police.Hours after the court ruling, Miguna was placed on an Emirates flight to Dubai, his lawyer said - the second time he has been deported this year.On Thursday, the politician said he had been dragged, assaulted and drugged during the forced deportation. ""I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sick. I need medical treatment ... I need urgent help here,"" he said on Twitter.The ministry had denied that Miguna was being held illegally this week and said he had failed to follow arrival procedures when he landed in Kenya.Veteran anti-corruption campaigner John Githongo said: ""The flagrant defiance of court orders by various branches of government is a setback for our institutions, which were maturing and gaining some independence after the passage of our new constitution in 2010.""(Reporting by Humphrey Malalo; Additional reporting by Maggie Fick; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Elias Biryabarema, John Stonestreet and Andrew Heavens)SYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been forced to delay introducing a bill to cut corporate tax due to a lack of Senate support, denying him a much-needed political victory as he struggles with poor polling a year from an election.The conservative leader wanted to cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 30 percent this week to shore up his white-collar base, after back-to-back scandals left him without several members of his ministry.But Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told the upper house late on Tuesday he would now introduce the tax cut bill in the next week of parliament, which is scheduled for May, after failing to get the necessary votes from two independent Senators.The delay leaves Turnbull without an upbeat message as he approaches a 30th straight Newspoll, a wide-watched opinion poll which has for the last 29 surveys had him trailing the Labor opposition.Losing 30 Newspolls would be a symbolic blow for Turnbull since he used that benchmark to justify ousting former leader Tony Abbott in 2015. The next Newspoll is due out on April 8.""The government's failure to pass the tax cuts means it has nothing to change the narrative that it is a government stuck in a rut,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.""Turnbull desperately needs some good news after several months of negative headlines.""Turnbull has struggled for months against a tide of long-running scandals over which he has seemed to have limited control.The second half of 2017 was dominated by a string of politician resignations amid questions about whether they held dual citizenship, a status which is banned for elected officials in Australia.The start of 2018 was then consumed by then deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce's admission that he was expecting a child with a former employee. Joyce stood down in February after media reports he was the subject of an unrelated misconduct complaint.Lobby group the Business Council of Australia (BCA) has been on a publicity offensive for corporate tax cuts in exchange for employing more people and higher wages.The BCA and 10 chief executive officers wrote to all senators with this promise, but an internal BCA survey of its member CEOs found just one in five planned to use company tax cuts to pay higher wages or employ more people, the Australian Financial Review reported.""I remain to be convinced that... I should support this bill in its current form,"" independent Senator Tim Storer, who joined parliament in January, told the upper house on Wednesday.""This bill is a narrowly cast proposition of change (and) I have doubts that the decision to reduce company tax for all companies is prudent to undertake in the face of Australia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s budget deficit"", Storer added.(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Michael Perry)PARIS ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Leaders of the far-right National Front and hard-left France Unbowed movement met booes on Wednesday when they joined a march in honor of a Holocaust survivor killed in a suspected anti-Semitic attack and were eventually forced to leave it.The National Front's Marine Le Pen and France Unbowed's Jean-Luc Melenchon had defied a prominent Jewish group's wishes by taking part in the march to honor Mireille Knoll.The 85-year-old was found dead with 11 stab wounds at her apartment in a working-class district of Paris on Friday. The apartment was set ablaze after the attack and her body badly burnt. Police suspect that Knoll's Jewish religion was a motive for the killing.Le Pen and Melenchon joined the march but they met a hostile reception from participants and when tensions threatened to boil over they pulled out. Le Pen later managed to rejoin the demonstration.Knoll was buried on Wednesday in Bagneux on the southern outskirts of Paris ahead of the march organized by Crif, an umbrella body of French Jewish groups. Crif's leader told far-right and far-left groups not to attend the rally.""Anti-Semites are over-represented in the far left and the far right, making those parties ones that you don't want to be associated with,"" Crif director Francis Kalifat told RTL radio. ""Therefore they are not welcome.""His comments underscore the enduring alarm among France's 400,000-strong Jewish community over anti-Semitism, which Interior Minister Gerard Collomb on Tuesday described as a cancer that must not be allowed to eat away at the nation.""We've got our place here. Once again (the Crif) have got the wrong enemy. We've been fighting Islamist anti-Semitism for years,"" Le Pen said defiantly despite the hostile reception she received.Other marches were held in Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg.Le Pen has strived to rid the party of the toxic anti-Semitic reputation it gained under her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen.However, France's highest court provided a reminder of the party's past on Tuesday when it upheld the conviction of her father for describing the Nazi gas chambers as a ""detail"" of history. It confirmed a 30,000 euro ($37,000)fine against him.Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned Knoll's murder and said it ""underlines the need to continue combating anti-Semitism in all its variations"".Knoll escaped being deported to Auschwitz during World War Two, when 13,000 Jews were rounded up in July 1942 in the capital's Velodrome d'Hiver.Her son Daniel said the rally should be open to everyone.""Crif is playing politics but I'm just opening my heart,"" he told RMC radio.President Emmanuel Macron's government said the rally should be a moment for national unity.Macron made reference to Knoll's death in a national tribute to a gendarme killed last week in an Islamist attack. The president said Knoll was murdered ""because she was Jewish"", by a killer who did not value life.(Reporting by Ingrid Melander,; Additional reporting by Sophie Louet, Arthur Connan, Leigh Thomas and Marine Pennetier in Paris and Jeffrey Heller in Jerusalem; Editing by Luke Baker, Alison Williams and Richard Balmforth)WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> John McEntee, who has served as President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal assistant since Mr. Trump won the presidency, was forced out of his position and escorted from the White House on Monday after an investigation into his finances caused his security clearance to be revoked, officials with knowledge of the incident said.But Mr. McEntee will remain in the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s orbit despite his abrupt departure from the White House. Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s re-election campaign announced Tuesday that Mr. McEntee had been named senior adviser for campaign operations, putting him in a position to remain as a close aide during the next several years.The campaign‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision underscores Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tolerance for ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and often encouragement of ‚<U+0080><U+0094> dueling centers of power around him. And it highlights the extent to which the re-election campaign has already become a landing pad for former Trump associates who have left the White House but remain loyal to the president.The decision to remove Mr. McEntee came to light on the same day that Mr. Trump announced that he was removing Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state and replacing him with Mike Pompeo, his C.I.A. director.Officials declined to say what issues prompted the security concerns about Mr. McEntee. Two people familiar with the decision to remove Mr. McEntee from the White House said he was known by colleagues to be a gambler.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has said in recent weeks that too many staff members were operating on interim security clearances because they could not pass F.B.I. background checks. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Mr. McEntee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s firing.But a senior administration official said that many of the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top aides were shocked and dismayed by the abrupt departure, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss personnel issues, said Mr. McEntee had been expected to travel with Mr. Trump ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as he always does ‚<U+0080><U+0094> when the president departed for a trip to California Tuesday morning.For Mr. Trump, the absence of Mr. McEntee strips away another of the handful of close associates who have constantly been by his side as he made the transition from real estate mogul to politician. Keith Schiller, the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longtime director of security, left the White House in September. Hope Hicks, the director of communications and one of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s closest aides, has announced she is leaving in the coming days as well.That left Mr. McEntee, who worked on the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campaign and was brought into the White House to be Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>body guy,‚<U+0080>ù the aide who travels with the president wherever he goes. During presidential trips, Mr. McEntee and the White House doctor were two aides who were never left off the travel manifest. Aides said that Mr. McEntee often tried to keep hangers-on away from Mr. Trump when he traveled to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.Now, with Mr. McEntee gone, the president will have none of his closest, most trusted aides by his side at all times. Kellyanne Conway, who remains close to Mr. Trump, does not frequently travel with the president. Ivanka Trump, his daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner, have offices near Mr. Trump but play different roles.Mr. McEntee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s departure has several of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s closest advisers worried about the effects on the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mood. The senior administration official said that the president had been in a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>good place‚<U+0080>ù recently, but said that it was hard to overstate the effect of the departure, along with that of Ms. Hicks. Both Mr. McEntee and Ms. Hicks have had offices just outside the Oval Office.A former quarterback with the University of Connecticut, Mr. McEntee had his first brush with fame when he released a football trick-shot video on YouTube that went viral in 2011. The nearly five-minute video has almost 7.3 million views.Mr. McEntee worked at Fox News in 2015 when he volunteered on Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s campaign and quickly became a full-time staff member. Over the course of the chaotic campaign, Mr. McEntee became close with Mr. Trump and joined the small cadre of loyal, trusted aides around him.Like Reggie Love, a former Duke basketball player who served as the personal assistant and first body man to President Barack Obama, Mr. McEntee was one of the few people with nearly constant access to the president he served.But unlike many of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s more famous advisers, Mr. McEntee was absent from public view, making virtually no comments to the news media and remaining largely under the radar amid the backbiting and chaos swirling around the president.Mr. McEntee‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ouster is the latest fallout from the security clearance scandal that erupted when Rob Porter, the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s staff secretary, resigned under pressure last month. Mr. Porter left after it was revealed that allegations of spousal abuse were holding up his permanent security clearance.A review of the security clearances at the White House by Mr. Kelly found that many officials were operating with interim clearances. In a memo to the staff last month, Mr. Kelly said that he would revoke the interim clearances for people whose background investigations showed they could not receive permanent clearance.Late last month, Mr. Kushner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s security clearance was downgraded, but Mr. Kushner remains a senior adviser at the White House working on Middle East peace efforts, prison reform and other issues for Mr. Trump.TOKYO ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Japan will have little choice but to enter into a bilateral trade deal with the United States similar to one President Donald Trump clinched with South Korea, a former top Japanese currency diplomat said.Naoyuki Shinohara, who was also deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said Washington will keep pushing for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) with Japan given Trump's ""America First"" agenda - and Tokyo's calls to use a multilateral framework will only buy it some time.""The United States is only interested in a bilateral deal and probably won't listen to Japanese calls for a multilateral approach on trade,"" said Shinohara, who retains close contact with international financial diplomats.""Japan will eventually have to enter FTA talks"" and face U.S. pressure to open up its auto and farm markets, he told Reuters on Friday.Global markets were shaken this month when Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing threatened similar measures, stoking fears of a global trade war.Shinohara said there was a small but real risk of a United States-China trade war, which could spiral out of control given Trump's unpredictability.""A trade war is a worse-case scenario and doesn't make economic sense as both sides will lose. But once there's a war, it's hard to stop shooting. The possibility is small but not unthinkable,"" he said.An escalating trade spat could spread, including to Japan, said Shinohara, currently a professor at a University of Tokyo research institute.SIMILAR APPROACH SEENJapanese policymakers worry that Trump could use a similar approach to what he took with South Korea, which agreed on a trade pact with a side deal to deter competitive currency devaluation.Shinohara, who coordinated Asian policies during his IMF stint, said there was a ""pretty good chance"" Washington will make similar demands to Japan - entering talks for a bilateral FTA, with a side deal on currencies.Trump will use such talks to demand more U.S. access to Japan's auto and highly-protected agricultural markets, he added.Japan and the United States remain at loggerheads on how to frame trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls for negotiations on a bilateral FTA.Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso has ruled out opening up talks for a bilateral trade deal, stressing that this would do no good for Japan.Trade will likely feature as a topic when Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hold a summit next month.(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Richard Borsuk)Facing a proliferation of sexual assault allegations involving a former team doctor, USA Gymnastics, the governing body for the sport, last year signed a nondisclosure agreement as part of a settlement with one of the accusers, McKayla Maroney.Maroney, a gold medalist at the 2012 London Games, is among the many gymnasts who have said they were abused by the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar.The settlement was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by Maroney against the United States Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, which employed Nassar. The existence of the suit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The lawsuit claims that Maroney ‚<U+0080><U+009C>was forced to agree to a nondisparagement clause and confidentiality provision,‚<U+0080>ù and that she would have had to pay more than $100,000 should she ‚<U+0080><U+009C>speak of her abuse or the settlement.‚<U+0080>ùUSA Gymnastics said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Contrary to reports, the concept of confidentiality was initiated by McKayla‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney, not USA Gymnastics. USA Gymnastics cannot speak to the mediation process, which is confidential and privileged under California law. The process culminated in a settlement agreement that included a mutual nondisclosure clause and a mutual nondisparagement clause.‚<U+0080>ùThe Olympic committee noted that it was not a part of the settlement, and said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are heartbroken that this abuse occurred, proud of the brave victims that have come forward and grateful that our criminal justice system has ensured that Nassar will never be able to harm another young woman.‚<U+0080>ùMichigan State said that it does not comment on continuing litigation.Maroney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer, John Manly, called the confidentiality agreement ‚<U+0080><U+009C>an immoral and illegal attempt to silence a victim of child sexual abuse‚<U+0080>ù in exchange for a financial settlement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>McKayla was and is in rough shape,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She needs help, therapy, she can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t work, for periods she couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even get out of bed. She was desperate for the financial support and needed to move on.‚<U+0080>ùWhen Maroney publicly disclosed her abuse in October, Manly said, she did so knowing that she faced financial penalties under the agreement. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It takes tremendous courage to publicly disclose it,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Knowing that any day there could be a process server at her door.‚<U+0080>ùManly said that under California law the victim of child sexual abuse cannot be forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of a settlement.USA Gymnastics said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The settlement in 2016 was in accordance with state law, despite what has been alleged.‚<U+0080>ùIn addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks to nullify the nondisclosure agreement.The suit said that Maroney agreed to the settlement in December 2016 in order to pay for psychological treatment. Nassar had been charged with criminal sexual conduct the previous month.Maroney is one of dozens of former gymnasts who have said Nassar molested them when treating them. He pleaded guilty to molestation charges in November and will be sentenced in January, although he already received a 60-year sentence for child pornography.Gold medalists Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas are among the other gymnasts who have accused Nassar of sexual assault.The secretary of veterans affairs, David J. Shulkin, for a year enjoyed rare bipartisan support in Washington as he reformed his department, but now officials in the Trump administration are trying to replace him.An email sent in December by Jake Leinenkugel, the White House senior adviser on veterans affairs, expressed frustration with Dr. Shulkin and listed ways to topple the leadership of his department once key legislation was passed.The email was addressed to Camilo Sandoval, a former data manager for the Trump campaign who was given a political post at the department. In it, Mr. Leinenkugel, a former brewery executive, wrote that although he initially had a positive impression of the secretary, they had fallen out over staffing and policy issues.Mr. Leinenkugel, who has an office in the department, proposed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>solutions‚<U+0080>ù in the email, including using a continuing investigation of the secretary‚<U+0080><U+0099>s travel to remove Dr. Shulkin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson; replacing the deputy secretary, Thomas G. Bowman, with Mr. Leinenkugel; and replacing Dr. Shulkin with a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>strong political candidate.‚<U+0080>ùDr. Shulkin, the only holdover from the Obama administration, expressed dismay in an interview on Wednesday over what he said seemed to be political appointees in his office working against him, saying that they were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>trying to undermine the department from within.‚<U+0080>ùCareer civil servants say the dispute has grown more heated than previous policy differences, and the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s headquarters, a block from the White House, is rived with infighting between the secretary‚<U+0080><U+0099>s supporters and opponents.The department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inspector general released a scathing report on Wednesday about a business trip Dr. Shulkin took to Britain and Denmark last year. The report said he spent much of the trip sightseeing and improperly accepted a gift of Wimbledon tickets; it also accused Ms. Wright Simpson of wrongdoing in connection with Dr. Shulkin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife‚<U+0080><U+0099>s airfare, which it said should not have been paid by the department.Dr. Shulkin characterized the report as inaccurate and biased, but he said he would reimburse the government for his wife‚<U+0080><U+0099>s airfare and pay for the tennis tickets.Mr. Leinenkugel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s suggested replacement for Dr. Shulkin would be likely to spark controversy: Michael J. Kussman, a former under secretary who has been associated with Concerned Veterans of America, a group funded largely by the billionaire conservative activists Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch that advocates shifting spending on veterans‚<U+0080><U+0099> health care to the private sector.It is not clear whether the president supports the move. The Department of Veterans Affairs referred questions about its leadership, the tensions in the department and Mr. Leinenkugel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s email to the White House, which declined to comment.The fight over the leadership of the department is part of a long-running battle over how to deliver health care to the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s veterans. The department currently operates its own health system, with more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics across the country where about nine million veterans receive treatment at little or no cost to them. Some conservatives, including some advisers to the White House, favor gradually dismantling that system and allowing veterans to choose to receive taxpayer-subsidized care from private doctors instead.Veterans‚<U+0080><U+0099> groups have overwhelmingly opposed that idea. But Mr. Trump promised during his election campaign that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vets will have the right to go to a V.A. facility or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice ‚<U+0080><U+0094> whatever is fastest or best for the vet.‚<U+0080>ùPolicymakers in both parties have said that offering that kind of unrestricted choice between the public system and private providers would be too expensive. They have generally favored a more measured approach that would allow the department to approve the use of private care when waiting times are too long at veterans‚<U+0080><U+0099> hospitals. Dr. Shulkin has also backed this plan.Dr. Shulkin said in the interview that he was determined to remain in his post. Though one lawmaker called for his resignation in the wake of the travel report, others were cordial to Dr. Shulkin at a budget hearing Thursday morning and did not bring up the report.He said he was investigating a number of political appointees in his department for misconduct and possible removal. On Thursday, he spoke directly to the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, about concerns that political appointees were trying to undermine his agency, according to department officials.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If there are people here who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want the V.A. to succeed, I want them out,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Shulkin said in the interview.Dr. Shulkin was an unexpected but popular choice for secretary. After the 2016 election, Mr. Trump considered several critics of the department as possible nominees to head the agency. But to the relief of most veterans‚<U+0080><U+0099> organizations, he chose Dr. Shulkin, a moderate who headed the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s health care system under President Barack Obama.Since then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Dr. Shulkin. At a bill signing in June, he said the secretary did not have to worry about hearing Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s old reality-show catchphrase, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re fired.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll never have to use those words on our David,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Trump said, pointing his finger at the secretary like a pistol. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We will never use those words on you, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s for sure.‚<U+0080>ùBut in recent months, some of the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s appointees have felt betrayed by what they see as backtracking at the department on access to privately provided health care, and have moved to oust Dr. Shulkin.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He has shown total disdain for the White House,‚<U+0080>ù said one White House official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ideological; it is just what the president wants. He wants veterans to have choice.‚<U+0080>ù The official said that current legislation to fund privately provided care was more restrictive than rules during the Obama administration.In December, according to congressional staff members, political appointees in the department quietly bypassed the secretary to advance legislation that would open the way for more privately provided health care for veterans. The bill was introduced by Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, who has received substantial campaign donations from the Koch brothers.Turmoil at the department seems to be growing. Last week The Washington Post quoted unnamed White House officials who said Mr. Bowman, the deputy secretary, would soon be fired as a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>warning shot‚<U+0080>ù to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>knock Shulkin down a peg or two‚<U+0080>ù for not pushing harder for privatization.In the interview, Dr. Shulkin said he had spoken to President Trump, and was told there were no plans to fire Mr. Bowman. He attributed the Post article to opponents trying to sow disarray.He said he was worried that his chief of staff‚<U+0080><U+0099>s email account might have been hacked, and was investigating the matter.In another sign of division, John Ullyot, a former top Trump campaign official who now runs the press office, told staff members in an email on Wednesday that reporters‚<U+0080><U+0099> requests for comment should not be forwarded to the secretary or deputy secretary; instead, he would be referring them all to the White House.The move forced Dr. Shulkin to do much of his communication with the media over the travel investigation on his personal cellphone.Three Muslim women have each reached a $60,000 settlement with New York City after they were forced to remove their hijabs to be photographed while in police custody, according to a city official and court documents obtained on Wednesday.Documents outlining the settlements were filed in Brooklyn federal court on Monday and reported by the The New York Daily News on Tuesday. Asked about the report, Kimberly Joyce, a spokeswoman for the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s law department, said in an emailed statement, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The resolution of these matters were in the best interest of all parties involved.‚<U+0080>ùThe settlements involved separate cases claiming that the women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s religious rights had been violated.In 2012, a Brooklyn high school student detained on a harassment complaint was told to remove her head scarf to be photographed at a central booking center in the borough. She had asked that a female officer take her picture in private, but the request was rejected, according to a complaint filed in district court that year.In 2015, a woman identified as J. H. was also told to remove her hijab at Brooklyn Central Booking, even though she explained she could not do so in the presence of men who were not family members, a complaint said.After she was photographed, an officer said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Wow, wow, wow‚<U+0080>ù about her hair, and male detainees laughed and made inappropriate comments, the complaint said.The same year, a Queens woman was taken into police custody after a dispute with a neighbor over a parking space. She was taken to the hospital and then to central booking, where she was photographed without her hijab, despite her objections, a complaint said.The women were arraigned on their criminal charges, but their cases were resolved without conviction and sealed, Tahanie A. Aboushi, a lawyer for the women, said in an interview on Wednesday.Ms. Aboushi said the cases touched on a broader point about religious dress that could apply to a number of people, including Orthodox Jewish women wearing modest clothing and Sikh men wearing turbans.In 2012, the New York Police Department patrol guide did not provide guidance for religious coverings as they related to photographs, she said. Some precincts and central booking facilities photographed Muslim women with their hijab, while others would request that it be removed, she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was discretionary,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Aboushi said.In 2015 and 2017, the department issued interim orders that people who were arrested could be photographed with religious head coverings at precincts or taken to a private area to be photographed at One Police Plaza, the headquarters compound in Manhattan.The cases are examples of how law enforcement officials, airport security personnel and even some employers have had to address or modify policies and practices to accommodate religious requirements.In 2016, a sheriff in Maine, Kevin Joyce of Cumberland County, publicly apologized after his department released mug shots of Muslim women without their hijabs. The women had been arrested after Black Lives Matter protests.‚<U+0080><U+009C>With everything going on nationally, I think it is important the public understand we are transparent, we make mistakes on occasion, we are not going to cover them up and we are going to do our best and learn from them,‚<U+0080>ù he told The Portland Press Herald.National advocacy and civil rights organizations have also addressed the issue, particularly at airports, where Muslim and Sikh travelers often say they are subjected to longer security checks because of their dress.In 2016, a well-known Sikh American actor, Waris Ahluwalia, was not allowed to board an airplane in Mexico City because he refused to remove his turban during a security check. His refusal led to a two-day standoff with the airline Aerom√©xico before he was allowed to fly home to the United States.Many government agencies, including motor vehicle departments and passport offices, allow women to wear their religious gear as long as it does not obstruct the face.Johnathan Smith, the legal director for Muslim Advocates, said he believed most lawsuits involving hijabs had taken place in the context of employment.But, he added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We regularly hear complaints from people who encounter a whole host of obstacles, from people who wear religious head coverings or people who fit the profile of what a Muslim looks like.‚<U+0080>ùWhen the curtain went down on Alexei Ratmansky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dense, complicated new work for New York City Ballet last weekend, the end of a long Sunday matinee, my friend and I turned to each other, not sure what to think.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What was with the gang rape scene?‚<U+0080>ù I said.My friend shook his head, as unenthused as I was.We both had been struck by it: a scene in which the ballerina Megan Fairchild (in a role originated by Sterling Hyltin), at the center of a group of five men, was aggressively thrown around against her character‚<U+0080><U+0099>s will ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a scene that happened, and then was over, not explicitly addressed again. At one point, the petite and strong Ms. Fairchild, trapped, was catapulted into the air, flailing violently (and rather impressively) while airborne.When her aggressors dispersed, she slapped her partner, Daniel Ulbricht, and he fell to the floor. Some people in the audience laughed. We didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t. The retaliation, if that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what it was, didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t match the gravity of the assault.In other words, we had seen a portrayal of a woman being physically violated, with essentially no consequences, no resolution, no critique of the men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s actions or of their unresolved nature. Sound familiar? Moreover, it was never less than beautiful to look at: controlled, virtuosic, glamorous.Did everyone see it this way? No, and I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not suggesting they should have. But I did, and the work, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa,‚<U+0080>ù which had had its premiere at the City Ballet gala a few nights before, left me feeling heavy, not offended so much as exhausted, as I tried to reconcile its flood of dazzling formal invention for a cast of 18 dancers (not unusual for Mr. Ratmansky) with its use of tired, troubling clich√©s (more surprising).If such sleek, unexamined images of violence against women ‚<U+0080><U+0094> this wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the only one in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa,‚<U+0080>ù but to me the most prominent and inexplicable ‚<U+0080><U+0094> weren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t so pervasive in contemporary ballet, I might have felt differently. But they are, and I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen enough.By ‚<U+0080><U+009C>images of violence against women,‚<U+0080>ù I mean not just depictions of violent acts but also the kind of forceful partnering that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s become so ubiquitous, so gratuitous, so banal in ballet ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the yanking, dragging, prying open of women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bodies by men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> both with and without a narrative pretext. Calling it out, as I did after seeing Angelin Preljocaj‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>La Stravaganza‚<U+0080>ù (1997) for City Ballet in 2014, or Mauro Bigonzetti‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Cantata‚<U+0080>ù (2000), performed by Gauthier Dance in 2016 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> feels as tiresome as watching it, and unpacking its history would take more space than I have here.Suffice it to say that this isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a new kind of grievance, dating back at least as far as Ann Daly‚<U+0080><U+0099>s controversial, oft-cited 1987 essay ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Balanchine Woman,‚<U+0080>ù in which she argued that George Balanchine‚<U+0080><U+0099>s celebrated Neo-Classicism hinged on the objectification of the ballerina, calling ballet ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one of our culture‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful models of patriarchal ceremony.‚<U+0080>ù (And let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not forget about an earlier rejection of that model, by the women who developed what we now call modern dance.)Men lifting, turning, supporting women ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s part of ballet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s DNA. But there are ways to work within these traditions, or subvert them, that give women equal power and agency, or at least try to. Mr. Ratmansky often has, one reason I expected more from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa.‚<U+0080>ù And Justin Peck, City Ballet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s artist in residence, seems interested in overhauling well-worn gender conventions, in both obvious ways (his ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Times Are Racing‚<U+0080>ù includes a gender-neutral role) and subtler ones, treating women like autonomous beings even in the context of more traditional partnering.My disappointment with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa‚<U+0080>ù led me to post a photo on Instagram ‚<U+0080><U+0094> my favorite place to air an impulsive thought ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with the caption ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no more gang rape scenes in ballets, please.‚<U+0080>ù (The photo was of my face, looking directly at the camera, wearing what I consider an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>over it‚<U+0080>ù kind of expression.) This prompted an expansive thread of comments, including by my colleague Alastair Macaulay, who had reviewed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa‚<U+0080>ù for The New York Times. He asked whether my call for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no more‚<U+0080>ù was a call for censorship: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Must works of art only depict people behaving correctly?‚<U+0080>ùThe answer, of course, is no. If artists want to deal with rape, gang or otherwise, as subject matter, they should, as they should grapple with any difficult issue. But they must really deal with it: Say something. Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t just toss it in as one more incidental plot twist, one more exquisite thing to behold. Acknowledge its urgency, its complexity and the fact that to many in the audience, it may not be so abstract.The score for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa,‚<U+0080>ù by Leonid Desyatnikov, was written for the 1990 Russian film ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sunset,‚<U+0080>ù inspired by Isaac Babel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s short stories about Jewish gangsters in Odessa at the end of the Russian Revolution. Mr. Ratmansky may have intended to evoke that world, including the harsh reality of its gender dynamics. But I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t feel especially transported, nor did he seem to be complicating, or commenting on, that harshness.Dance, being wordless, leaves ample room for interpretation, perhaps more than other art forms. Another colleague who saw ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa,‚<U+0080>ù a veteran dance critic, told me that she, too, saw a rape scene, but that it took place in Mr. Ulbricht‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dream. For her, the work‚<U+0080><U+0099>s violent moments were also its most profound, reflecting the darkness of Mr. Ratmansky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s source material. Mr. Macaulay, in his review, noted that there were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>moments of personal violence.‚<U+0080>ùYet I also wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t alone in my reading. When I posted my plea for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>no more,‚<U+0080>ù I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t specify what had provoked it, and apparently I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t need to. Within minutes, a friend commented, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Did you see ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Odessa‚<U+0080><U+0099>?‚<U+0080>ùMr. Ratmansky‚<U+0080><U+0099>s work often rewards multiple viewings, and if I see ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Odessa‚<U+0080>ù again, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll understand it differently. What my first viewing inspired is a hope that if choreographers are going to engage with the all-too-present issue of violence against women, they do so in a responsible way that tries to shift the paradigm of what we face out in the world ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that proposes some alternative, or at least offers a substantive critique ‚<U+0080><U+0094> instead of replicating what we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen enough of.NEW DELHI ‚<U+0080><U+0094> India‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Supreme Court upheld on Friday the death sentence for four men who were found guilty of raping and disemboweling a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in 2012, a crime that came to embody the menace lurking in India‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sprawling, chaotic cities.The decision was unusual. While Indian trial courts aggressively impose death sentences, 95 percent of them have been overturned or commuted by higher courts in recent years, a recent study showed, typically in consideration of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>mitigating circumstances‚<U+0080>ù like slipshod investigations or the potential of the accused to be rehabilitated.The ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Delhi gang rape,‚<U+0080>ù as it came to be known, riveted the public from the start, setting off street protests and months of play-by-play coverage.The 23-year-old, Jyoti Singh Pandey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> dubbed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nirbhaya,‚<U+0080>ù or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fearless,‚<U+0080>ù by Indian journalists ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was a kind of avatar of aspirational India. Her father, who earns around $200 a month as an airport baggage handler, had sold family land to pay for her training as a physiologist. Sometimes, he called her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>beta,‚<U+0080>ù the Hindi word for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>son.‚<U+0080>ùReturning home from a movie at a crowded mall with a male friend, she boarded a private bus to discover that it was already occupied by a group of young men, working-class migrants who had been drinking.While the bus circled the city, the men attacked the pair, took Ms. Pandey to the back of the bus and raped her, at one point penetrating her with a metal rod and perforating her colon. The two were dumped on the roadside, naked and bleeding, and remained there for nearly two hours before police officers arrived and took them to a hospital. Her attackers were identified, in some cases, by bite marks that covered her body. She died two weeks later of her injuries.Her story ignited public fury. At court hearings, activists would stand with heavy nooses looped around their necks, chanting: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hang the rapists! Hang the rapists!‚<U+0080>ù Flamboyant celebrity lawyers, who agreed to defend the accused, were frequently immobilized by a scrum of cameramen.A crucial factor in the court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decision to uphold the death penalty was the demand of India‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>collective conscience,‚<U+0080>ù said Justice Dipak Misra in the court‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ruling on Friday, which cited a ‚<U+0080><U+009C> ‚<U+0080><U+0098>tsunami‚<U+0080><U+0099> of shock in the mind of the collective.‚<U+0080>ùHe wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is absolutely obvious that the accused persons had found an object for enjoyment in her. It sounds like a story from a different world, where humanity has been treated with irreverence.‚<U+0080>ùAfter the decision was announced, the courtroom broke out in applause. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should be castrated first!‚<U+0080>ù one lawyer called out. Ms. Pandey‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother wept with relief, embracing the people who surrounded her, while her father, Badri Nath Singh, seemed to exhale.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It is most important for us that these men should be hanged,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What my heart was saying is that this kind of crime has never happened in the past, and it will never happen in the future. It never entered into my mind that they would not be hanged. It will instill fear in the hearts of rapists.‚<U+0080>ùLegal experts noted that public outrage over rapes is selective, and they questioned whether it should be factored into legal judgments.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not as though every time there is a rape there is a convulsion in India society,‚<U+0080>ù said Vrinda Grover, a Supreme Court lawyer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wish there were.‚<U+0080>ùJust a day earlier, Mumbai‚<U+0080><U+0099>s High Court had finally upheld the convictions of 11 men in the 2002 gang rape of Bilkis Bano, a Muslim who was assaulted by a group of Hindu men during religious riots in the western state of Gujarat. But that case, which has crept through the legal system for 15 years, has never generated public outrage.Ms. Grover, who opposes the death penalty, said she did not believe the execution of the four men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a fruit vendor, a bus attendant, a gym handyman and an unemployed man ‚<U+0080><U+0094> would serve as a deterrent to future rapists.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very easy to demonize a few people and hang them,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is almost like a societal orgasm, that we are all good and we have eliminated from our midst all the bad men.‚<U+0080>ùDOKKUM, the Netherlands ‚<U+0080><U+0094> When Wybe van der Gang was looking for a new watch, he knew exactly what he wanted: It should have extraordinary aesthetics, with a clean-milled case. It should sit well on his wrist. But it would also have to exist outside his own imagination and, as he soon discovered, it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t.So he made it himself. And in 2004, he founded Van der Gang Watches.Never mind that he had no background or training in design, no knowledge of watchmaking. It was how he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d always done things.As a boy, Mr. van der Gang, whose father owned a company that made slot machines, amused himself by taking things apart: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Vacuum cleaners,‚<U+0080>ù he recalled recently in his offices in Dokkum, a small city near the northernmost edge of the Netherlands. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Steam irons.‚<U+0080>ùIn high school, he taught himself to repair top-of-the-line Italian motorcycles. Had he taken watches apart, the Dutch author Bert Wagendorp asked in a recent interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. van der Gang answered. But he had read a couple of books.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I always need a challenge,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. van der Gang, 53, said later. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sit a minute without thinking of a new challenge.‚<U+0080>ùMr. van der Gang also had 12 years of expertise in manufacturing instruments for the space and medical industries. Exakt Fijnmechanika, the company he founded soon after receiving his degree in precision engineering from the Instrumentmakers School in Leiden, produces precision components such as those used in ophthalmological surgery, the aerospace industry ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and, these days, watchmaking.Beginning with a few Dutch clients in 1990, the company has earned an international reputation for producing superior elements for industries that require optimal accuracy and minute components.Which was exactly what Mr. van der Gang wanted in his ideal watch. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I needed a level of quality and workmanship that was higher than you find in the jewelry world,‚<U+0080>ù he said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the jewelry world, if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s beautiful, if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shiny, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s good. But companies that work in the space industry demand more. So we used the techniques from our Fijnmechanika business to make a watch.‚<U+0080>ùThe first watch took two years to develop. Priced at 5,600 euros (now, $6,835), the limited edition of 250 sold out, mostly through word of mouth. The prototype, made of paper with a piece of standard plastic for a crystal, is still displayed at the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s showroom, where Mr. van der Gang presented it with the pride of a young father showing photos of his newborn.And indeed, its creation marked the birth of Van der Gang Watches, which shares offices with Exakt Fijnmechanika in a former agricultural school, built in the 1950s. Mr. van der Gang renovated and redesigned the space himself, from the glass-walled rooms, windowed corridors and spare, laboratory-like workshops to the all-white furnishings and red glass chandeliers.A small, wiry man with wild, wiry curls, Mr. van der Gang moves with a sprite-like enthusiasm and energy, though his conversation is measured, his voice gentle and calm. If the character of Van der Gang watches lies in their details, then the same is true of their creator.Despite his emphasis on technology, there are indications of another, sentimental side. His wife, a graphic artist, helps design each watch face. A eight-foot-high photograph of his daughter as a toddler (she is now 16) fills the wall opposite his work table. He gave the first watch he ever made to his father. And although he now keeps the first and last examples of every new model for the archives, the second one still goes to Dad.That sentimentality also fuels his creative process. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have a passion for making something beautiful and the best,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. van der Gang said.On the sporty, aviation-style Vlieger 20045WW-T, for instance, the sapphire crystal, cut flat to enhance shine, rises a tenth of an inch to stand, bezel-free, above the case. No other brands, he said, produce this free-standing, faceted edge or use such thick crystals ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the sapphire and the faceting process are too costly.But profit is not Mr. van der Gang‚<U+0080><U+0099>s primary goal, even though sharing office space and much of its equipment with Exakt allowed the company to begin turning a profit in 2010. The compatibility of the two concerns also allows Mr. van der Gang to produce a relatively affordable high-end watch ‚<U+0080><U+0094> models now are priced from ‚<U+0082>¨5,900 to ‚<U+0082>¨22,000 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> while still meeting his exacting demands.To ensure this standard of quality, the company purchases basic Swiss-made movements, then dismantles and rebuilds them to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to create something that doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t exist,‚<U+0080>ù explained Roel van den Haak, co-owner of the Amsterdam Watch Company, an official Van der Gang dealer.Van der Gang creates all the complications, such as chronograph and second time-zone functions, in-house, along with all parts that connect the shaft and movement to the watch itself. Numerals are hand-placed, the cases hand-polished. A complication moon feature, one of Mr. van der Gang‚<U+0080><U+0099>s favorites, shows the actual shape of phases of the moon. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He invents many of the different functions,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. van den Haak said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This is part of what makes him unique.‚<U+0080>ùMr. van der Gang‚<U+0080><U+0099>s greatest pride, however, are the watch cases, which are carved rather than cast. For the steel Vlieger case, for instance, a block of steel weighing a little more than two pounds is cut down with high-voltage wires until it weighs a bit more than a half an ounce.‚<U+0080><U+009C>By milling and turning, we take material away, so you can sculpt it to any shape you want,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. van der Gang said. The same process is used for gold and ceramic cases, resulting in sharp, clean edges, and a modeled underside that fits comfortably against the wrist.Additionally, transparent blue sapphire crystal casebacks ‚<U+0080><U+009C>show that the inside is as beautiful as the outside,‚<U+0080>ù said Maaike Borstlap, the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s marketing director.Mr. van der Gang is building on his initial success, examining ways to expand his market beyond the Netherlands.Now, the watches are available only through two Dutch shops, on the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s websites and by phone order.Still, Mr. van der Gang has no intention of becoming a mass-market brand. The company employs eight people, two of them watchmakers, and produces 150 watches a year, each made to order. The process usually takes about four months, Mr. van der Gang said, though it can be expedited.Meantime, Mr. van der Gang is busy developing a perpetual calendar watch, a project he has been working on for several years. It could be produced now, he said, although it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not as perfect yet as he would like.But there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s time.Planting a flag firmly at the intersection of patriarchy, sexism and white supremacy, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Rape of Recy Taylor‚<U+0080>ù is a documentary of multiple layers and marvelous gumption. As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.Were it not for the director‚<U+0080><U+0099>s steady hand and adamantine focus on her destination, this ambition could have been the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s undoing. Instead, its scope is stirring, the gradual accumulation of insult and outrage reaching far beyond tiny Abbeville where the crime occurred and where Recy, then 24, lived with her husband and new daughter. The miracle, though, is that the movie isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a diatribe. Its voices ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including several members of Recy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family and that of Rosa Parks herself, who investigated the assault ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are gentle and persuasive, using the horrific details of the rape and its aftermath as ballast to stabilize a heart-wrenching history of systemic injustice.The cleverness of this structure only gradually becomes apparent as Ms. Buirski slowly obliterates skin tone distinctions to land on a perfectly calibrated final section. Some may chide her, not without cause, for overreaching; yet the emotional impact of her deep-diving images ‚<U+0080><U+0094> especially the astonishing clips from the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>race films‚<U+0080>ù of the 1940s and earlier ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is profound. An evocative shot of a black woman in a white dress, fleeing from someone in graceful terror, reminds us repeatedly of the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s original atrocity.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They played in her body,‚<U+0080>ù Recy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sister Alma Daniels says at one point. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s perhaps the most devastating claim in a film overflowing with them.Recy Taylor, a 24-year-old African-American sharecropper, was walking home from church in Abbeville, Ala., on the night of Sept. 3, 1944, when she was abducted and raped by six white men.The crime was extensively covered in the black press and an early catalyst for the civil rights movement. The N.A.A.C.P. sent a young activist from its Montgomery, Ala., chapter named Rosa Parks to investigate. African-Americans around the country demanded that the men be prosecuted.But the attack, like many involving black victims during the Jim Crow era in the South, never went to trial. Two all-white, all-male grand juries refused to indict the men, even though one of them had confessed.Decades passed before the case gained renewed attention, with the publication in 2010 of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a New History of the Civil Rights Movement From Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power,‚<U+0080>ù by the historian Danielle L. McGuire. The book prompted an official apology in 2011 to Mrs. Taylor by the Alabama Legislature, which called the failure to prosecute her attackers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>morally abhorrent and repugnant.‚<U+0080>ùMrs. Taylor died in Abbeville on Thursday, three weeks after the release of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Rape of Recy Taylor,‚<U+0080>ù a documentary about the crime. She was 97. The death was confirmed by her brother, Robert Lee Corbitt.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Many ladies got raped,‚<U+0080>ù Mrs. Taylor said in the film, interviewed by its director, Nancy Buirski. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The peoples there ‚<U+0080><U+0094> they seemed like they wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t concerned about what happened to me, and they didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t try and do nothing about it. I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help but tell the truth of what they done to me.‚<U+0080>ùBorn on Dec. 31, 1919, to a family of sharecroppers in Abbeville, in southeastern Alabama, Recy (pronounced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>REE-see‚<U+0080>ù) Corbitt found herself caring for six younger siblings after their mother died when she was 17.On the night of the attack, she had gone to Rock Hill Holiness Church for a Pentecostal service of singing and praying and was walking home along a country highway bounded by peanut farms. A friend, Fannie Daniel, 61, and Ms. Daniel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 18-year-old son, West, were with her. They noticed a green Chevrolet passing by several times.Eventually the car stopped, and seven young white men, armed with guns and knives, stepped out. One of them, Herbert Lovett, the oldest in the group, ordered the three to halt, and then pointed a shotgun at them when they ignored him.The men forced Mrs. Taylor into the car at gunpoint and drove her to a grove of pine trees on the side of the road, where they forced her to disrobe. She begged to be allowed to go, citing her husband and their 3-year-old daughter. But Mr. Lovett was unmoved. Ordering her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>act just like you do with your husband or I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll cut your damn throat,‚<U+0080>ù he and five other men raped her. (A seventh young man, Billy Howerton, said later that he did not take part because he knew Mrs. Taylor.)Dumped out of the car, Mrs. Taylor removed her blindfold and stumbled toward safety. Her father, Benny Corbitt, had learned of the abduction and gone searching for her. Soon the county sheriff, George H. Gamble, arrived.Mrs. Taylor told Sheriff Gamble that she could not identify her assailants, but her description of the car matched only one vehicle in the county, that of Hugo Wilson. When the sheriff returned with Mr. Wilson and his father, Mrs. Taylor identified Mr. Wilson as one of her attackers, as did the teenage friend.Questioned at the county jail, Mr. Wilson acknowledged that he and five others ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Lovett, Dillard York, Luther Lee, Willie Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all had intercourse with her,‚<U+0080>ù but insisted that they had paid her and that it was not rape. The sheriff sent Mr. Wilson home.The next evening, Mrs. Taylor faced new threats: White vigilantes set her porch on fire. The following day, she and her husband, Willie Guy Taylor, and their daughter, Joyce Lee, moved in with her father and siblings. Mr. Corbitt, her father, would sleep in a chinaberry tree in the backyard, watching over the family while cradling a double-barreled shotgun, going inside to sleep only after the sun rose.As word of the crime spread through Alabama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s black community the N.A.A.C.P.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Montgomery chapter sent Mrs. Parks, who had spent much of her childhood in Abbeville, to interview Mrs. Taylor.The deputy sheriff, Lewey Corbitt (not a close relation), was not happy about Mrs. Parks‚<U+0080><U+0099>s presence. He drove past the house repeatedly and then forcibly ejected her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want any troublemakers here in Abbeville,‚<U+0080>ù he warned her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t go, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll lock you up.‚<U+0080>ùMindful of the outrage surrounding the case of the Scottsboro Boys ‚<U+0080><U+0094> nine black teenagers who had been wrongly accused of raping two white women in 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the county prosecutor took care to provide a semblance of equal justice. But it was an empty gesture.When the grand jury met on Oct. 3 and 4, 1944, Mrs. Taylor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s loved ones were the only witnesses. None of the men had been arrested, and there had not been a police lineup, so Mrs. Taylor could not identify her attackers.The grand jury declined to indict the men. Word spread through union halls, churches, barbershops, pool halls and, significantly, through the black press. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alabama Whites Attack Woman; Not Punished,‚<U+0080>ù declared a headline in The Pittsburgh Courier, an African-American newspaper.It was the final year of World War II, and some blacks likened their struggle for equal rights to the fight against fascism. Eugene Gordon, a black writer for The Daily Worker, a Communist newspaper in New York, interviewed Mrs. Taylor and told his readers, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The raping of Mrs. Recy Taylor was a fascist-like brutal violation of her personal rights as a woman and as a citizen of democracy.‚<U+0080>ùAt an emergency meeting in the Hotel Theresa in Harlem on Nov. 25, 1944, the Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor, which Mrs. Parks had helped organize, became a national organization. It spearheaded a campaign of letters, petitions and postcards urging Gov. Chauncey Sparks to investigate.The governor, who was a mentor of the segregationist future governor George C. Wallace, came under considerable pressure as African-American activists like W. E. B. DuBois and Mary Church Terrell and writers like Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes took up Mrs. Taylor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cause.The governor sent investigators, who found that Sheriff Gamble had lied about having arrested the men. By then, four of the seven men had admitted to having had sex with Mrs. Taylor, but they insisted that she had participated willingly.One of the men, Willie Joe Culpepper, however, backed up Mrs. Taylor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, saying she had been coerced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was crying and asking us to let her go home to her husband and baby,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Despite the confession, a second grand jury, on Feb. 14, 1945, refused to hand up an indictment.The civil rights activists eventually moved on, and Mrs. Taylor faded into obscurity. Fearing reprisals, she moved to Montgomery for a few months with help from Mrs. Parks. Eventually the family moved to Central Florida, where Mrs. Taylor picked oranges.She and Mr. Taylor separated, and he died in the early 1960s. Their only child died in a car crash in 1967. Mrs. Taylor had two subsequent partners, both of whom died. She lived for many years in Winter Haven, Fla., before failing health prompted her relatives to bring her back to Abbeville.In addition to her brother, she is survived by two sisters, Lillie Kinsey and Mary Murry; a granddaughter; and several great-grandchildren.The publication of Ms. McGuire‚<U+0080><U+0099>s book led to apologies from the mayor of Abbeville and from the county and state governments in 2011. The Alabama Legislature‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apology was formally presented to Mrs. Taylor on Mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Day that year at the Pentecostal church, now known as Abbeville Memorial Church of God in Christ, where she had worshiped the night of the crime.In Ms. Buirski‚<U+0080><U+0099>s film, Mrs. Taylor recalled how she could have easily been killed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lord was just with me that night,‚<U+0080>ù she said.BEIJING ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Less than a week after naming Yi Gang as the governor of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s central bank, leaders in Beijing have unexpectedly put a different man above him as the Communist Party secretary at the central bank, five people familiar with the decision said on Sunday.Guo Shuqing, already the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s top banking and insurance regulator, has been selected as the new party secretary, said the five people who were not authorized to discuss the decision publicly. While Mr. Guo and Mr. Yi both have reputations as avid financial reformers who want to address China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s addiction to debt-fueled economic growth, Mr. Guo has much better political connections.By adding the role of party secretary of the central bank, Mr. Guo emerges with even broader responsibilities over the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s financial system. Mr. Guo has already run the China Banking Regulatory Commission for the past year, and a week ago, the National People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Congress voted to fold the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insurance regulatory agency into the commission.Mr. Yi‚<U+0080><U+0099>s predecessor, Zhou Xiaochuan, has been the central bank‚<U+0080><U+0099>s governor and also its party secretary for the past 16 years. In China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s system, the governor is responsible for running the central bank, but the party secretary has the final say on the strategic direction.In splitting the two jobs, China is essentially acting like some big American corporations that have at times separated the position of chairman of the board from the job of the chief executive who actually runs the company. General Motors has repeatedly tried this approach, most recently when Mary T. Barra became the chief executive in 2014 but did not add the role of chairman until 2016.In that analogy, Mr. Guo will essentially become the chairman of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s central bank while Mr. Yi, as governor, will act like a chief executive. Both men will answer to Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to President Xi Jinping who advocates a greater reliance on market forces in the Chinese economy.Mr. Liu joined the Politburo last October and last Monday became China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vice premier for financial and industrial policy.Jan Svejnar, the director of the Center on Global Economic Governance at Columbia University, said that China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s rapid shake-up in top financial regulatory jobs indicated that the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leaders were determined to act on weaknesses in the financial system. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They are interested because they want to contain any problems that will arise,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Word of Mr. Guo‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new role spread rapidly on Sunday morning at the China Development Forum, one of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s premier annual gatherings for economic policy experts from around the world. The People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Bank of China declined to provide any immediate comment.Mr. Yi gave a speech and took questions from the audience at the conference in the early afternoon but did not mention Mr. Guo. In his speech, Mr. Yi said that China would act resolutely against anyone who engaged in illegal financial activities without a license ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a reference to a continuing campaign against so-called shadow banking.China said last November that it would open its financial sector to greater international competition, in an unsuccessful move to tamp down President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s demands for a narrowing of the United States trade deficit with China. Mr. Yi, explaining himself clearly in terms that frequently hinted at his background as an economics professor, said that the opening would continue.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The more a sector opens, the more competitive it will become,‚<U+0080>ù he said.After a quarter-century of rapid growth, the Chinese economy stalled momentarily at the start of 2009 during the global financial crisis. China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leaders responded by flooding the economy with credit, in a massive monetary stimulus program that exceeded those of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in terms of the increase in broadly measured money supply.That stimulus program allowed the Chinese economy to resume rapid growth almost immediately. But China has been adding debt ever since, building a national grid of high-speed train lines and forests of city skyscrapers as leaders have been reluctant to let growth slow.Two credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and Moody‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, downgraded China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sovereign debt last year on concerns about the buildup of domestic debt. Chinese officials have publicly acknowledged that they need to address rising leverage but contend that the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s minimal foreign debt, strong economic growth and increasingly stringent financial regulation mean that they have ample time to defuse the problem without a sharp slowdown in economic growth.Mr. Guo has previously served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and as the governor of Shandong Province ‚<U+0080><U+0094> two posts that gave him considerable clout and status in the Communist Party, which oversees all agencies of the government.By contrast, Mr. Yi is a former economics professor in Indiana who then taught in Beijing and spent the past two decades working his way up the ranks of the civil service at the central bank.Angel Gurr√≠a, the secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that the clear trend in recent weeks in China had been for the top jobs to be filled by technocrats with extensive financial expertise and with strong political credentials. He also cited Liu Kun, a longtime budget expert who became China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s finance minister last Monday.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The trend is very clear ‚<U+0080><U+0094> you strengthen the political level with people who are very knowledgeable in their expertise,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Gurr√≠a said.Other experts in Chinese policymaking said that the real contrast right now was between Liu He and his predecessor as vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Ma Kai. Mr. Ma was an influential advocate of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s state-owned enterprises and was wary of policy changes that might result in bankruptcies at these enterprises leading to job losses.That concern for state-owned enterprises appears to have faded as debt has become a bigger worry. But while Mr. Xi, the president, and Premier Li Keqiang and other leaders have all talked lately about addressing debt, the question remains whether they will keep tightening the brakes on China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credit system if the economy slows noticeably this year.One of the dilemmas for China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leaders in choosing a successor for Mr. Zhou at the central bank was that whoever holds the title of governor is expected these days to travel extensively to meetings with other central bank governors to coordinate policy. That makes the governor somewhat less able to participate in the continuous debate in Beijing over exactly which domestic financial policies to adopt.Mr. Yi speaks excellent English and will now play the role of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s monetary policy statesman to the world. But adding Mr. Guo as party secretary means that an influential and strongly pro-reform voice will represent the central bank in interagency debates in Beijing, even when Mr. Yi is out of the country.A FALSE REPORT A True Story of Rape in America By T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong 291 pp. Crown Publishers. $28.In 2008, an 18-year-old named Marie reported that she‚<U+0080><U+0099>d been raped. A stranger with a knife entered her apartment in Lynnwood, Wash., while she was sleeping, she told the police, tied her up with one of her shoestrings and blindfolded and gagged her. He then took photographs that he threatened to post online if she went to the police.It was a story out of a horror movie or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Law & Order‚<U+0080>ù script. Indeed, Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s foster mother, Peggy, thought of the TV show when she heard Marie recount her ordeal with, Peggy thought, an odd degree of emotional detachment. Peggy knew Marie to have a flair for drama, and she started to nurse doubt about whether her attention-getting tale was true. Another woman close to Marie, a second foster mother, was also uncertain. Peggy relayed her misgivings to the police, setting in motion a chain of disastrous decisions by the Lynnwood investigators that unraveled the life Marie was just beginning to make for herself, and gave T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong the title for their new book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A False Report.‚<U+0080>ùInterrogated as if she were a suspect and pressured to recant, Marie wound up facing criminal charges for lying to the police. She was a teenager coming out of foster care and her sense of self and her support system was tentative and fragile. She lost her subsidized apartment and many of her friends. Her plans to get a driver‚<U+0080><U+0099>s license and go to college floated away in a sea of despair.The John Grisham-worthy twist comes from the investigation of three rapes 1,300 miles away, in two suburbs and a city outside of Denver. The Police Departments in the three places in Colorado (Aurora, Golden and Westminster) pooled their clues and figured out they were probably looking for the same attacker. They found him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the break in the case came from a single detail about the spotting of a white truck. On the rapist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer, they found the photos he took of Marie. Years later, here was incontrovertible proof that she had told the truth.The parallel tales allow Miller and Armstrong to juxtapose the damage of a botched rape investigation and the triumph of careful and skilled police work. Though stranger rape isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the norm for sexual assault, or the focus of the sexual misconduct fueling the #MeToo moment in which this book appears, it offers broadly relevant lessons. One of the valiant detectives in Colorado (this is a book that turns law enforcement characters into heroes) explains that her rule isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t simply ‚<U+0080><U+009C>believe your victim‚<U+0080>ù; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>listen and verify,‚<U+0080>ù which gives her space to refute or corroborate the account, depending on where the evidence takes her. Another detective in Aurora explains how he learned that there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>right way‚<U+0080>ù for a survivor to respond to an assault. The 65-year-old victim he interviewed was matter-of-fact rather than emotional, much like Marie, but he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t discount her credibility, and that withholding of judgment helped catch the serial attacker.Miller and Armstrong point out a pattern in Lynnwood. The police there wrote off as unfounded 21 percent of the rape reports they received during the five years in which the book unfolds. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s five times the national average. An external reviewer said that if the two police officers who interrogated Marie hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t documented their own ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bullying and coercive‚<U+0080>ù behavior, he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>would have been skeptical‚<U+0080>ù that such conduct actually happened. Though Miller and Armstrong don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say so, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one more telling illustration of who does or doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get the benefit of the doubt.One of the two officers who blew Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case comes across as a secondary villain. Jerry Rittgarn, who threatened Marie with jail if she failed a lie-detector test, left Lynnwood to work as a private investigator. He told Miller and Armstrong he would talk to them only if they paid him, while complaining about ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victims who lie‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a biased story.‚<U+0080>ù The other officer, however, is introspective enough to be the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most complex figure. Sgt. Jeffrey Mason questioned whether he was qualified to do his job ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after more than 20 years as a cop ‚<U+0080><U+0094> when he learned he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d helped prosecute a vulnerable rape victim. When Marie asked for an apology, he showed up and said he was sorry; she found him sincere. Peggy disappointed Marie at first with her muted response but then expressed her intense regret and worked to repair their relationship.In Lynnwood, the Police Department didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fire or discipline anyone, but it did try to learn from its mistakes, Miller and Armstrong reassuringly report. Lynnwood added training on the effect of trauma, which can cause rape victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> memories to fragment, and adopted well-respected guidelines, which train police officers not to doubt a victim because he or she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t behave as expected and ‚<U+0080><U+0094> crucially ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not to accuse one of lying without definite proof.Miller and Armstrong tell their story plainly, expertly and well. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gripping and needs no dressing up. More confusing accounts of sexual assault, in which consent is disputed with anguish in a toxic swirl of partying and hook-up culture, have become part of the landscape, especially on college campuses. These contested stories divide our sympathies and spur angry debates. The doubt that Marie confronted, on the other hand, leaves no trail of did he or didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t he. In its moral clarity, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible to find Miller and Armstrong‚<U+0080><U+0099>s project comforting. There is a bad guy. His name is Marc O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s now in prison for life. (Actually, 327¬Ω years, so several lives.)Miller and Armstrong interviewed O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary in prison but it seems, understandably, as if it was hard for them to get into his head. In recreated flashbacks that rely on phrases like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the beast wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t rest‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the monster would gather strength,‚<U+0080>ù the authors show him stalking women and breaking into their homes by night. All the while, O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary was secretly operating a group of specialized porn sites. He was also playing guitar with his friends and planning to have a baby with his wife. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sounds clich√©, I guess, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really kind of an actual Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in real life,‚<U+0080>ù O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary said at his own trial. That plus some idea about the duality of man, which he got from reading Carl Jung, are about as deep as it gets.Miller and Armstrong teamed up for the project that became this book when they discovered they were working on it separately. Miller was reporting on the Colorado angle for ProPublica, an investigative news organization, and Armstrong was chasing Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story for the Marshall Project, a group that focuses on criminal justice journalism. They won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for an article that led to this book (a Netflix series is also in the works).Two years ago, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This American Life‚<U+0080>ù ran an episode (narrated by Armstrong and the producer Robyn Semien) that can serve as a nice companion to the book by giving us Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice on tape. At 25, she is raw but also resilient. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It broke me,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the doubt she was raped and its repercussions. But when the police told her O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary had been identified as her assailant, and that her criminal record would be expunged, she got her driver‚<U+0080><U+0099>s license and then a job as a truck driver. She is now married and has two children. Marie is a testament to the harm of poor police work that derails a rape investigation. But she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also a person living her life. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the larger lesson of a nonfiction narrative like this one: It continues, beyond a book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pages.The hip-hop entrepreneur Damon Dash has been producing and directing motion pictures since the late 1990s. You‚<U+0080><U+0099>d never know it from looking at ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honor Up,‚<U+0080>ù a new movie he directed from a script he wrote with Kevin Bennett.The filmmaking is point-and-shoot rudimentary (when it wants to get fancy, it resorts to split-screen effects that bring to mind the 1980s production software called Video Toaster). The acting is awkward (Mr. Dash himself has a leading role), and the characters themselves indifferently delineated. Clich√©s are rife, both in dialogue (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sometimes good guys have to do bad things‚<U+0080>ù) and construction (shootout scenes are frequently scored to arias and fake-arias sung by Radmila Lolly).And yet this anecdotal movie about drug dealers and their internecine troubles, and their further troubles with the justice system, can be oddly persuasive. Narrated by Mr. Dash‚<U+0080><U+0099>s character, named O.G., the movie begins by laying out the meaning of the title phrase. Which is pretty much what you‚<U+0080><U+0099>d infer: that you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t rat out your partners in the criminal enterprise that players call ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the game.‚<U+0080>ù The movie then shows various gang members and rivals facing each other down, wiping each other out, and eventually giving each other up.Nicholas Turturro as a relentless and racist cop, and Eishia Brightwell as the ostensibly ‚<U+0080><U+009C>off limits‚<U+0080>ù sister of a dealer who tries to get herself a piece of gang action, make particularly vivid impressions. For all of its failings, the movie sometimes manages to bring a scary whiff of the street into its sounds and images.China plans to name a new leader for its central bank on Monday in a move signaling that Beijing will continue an ambitious ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and, some say, much needed ‚<U+0080><U+0094> financial shake-up to get the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s debt under control and keep its economy growing.Yi Gang, an American-educated economist, is set to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank‚<U+0080><U+0099>s governor for more than 15 years, two people familiar with the decision said. The choice of Mr. Yi, a prot√©g√© and deputy of Mr. Zhou, almost guarantees continuity in Chinese policy.The leadership change follows a broader pattern as President Xi Jinping consolidates power and pushes through his economic agenda. In recent months, Beijing has been more outspoken about dealing with the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s debt problems and forcing deeply indebted private sector companies to sell assets and pay off some of their loans.The central bank chief will play a major role, trying to ensure that just the right amount of credit flows to the economy. But Mr. Yi will not likely carry the same clout as his predecessor, an important architect of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s considerable yet incomplete transition from central planning to a market-oriented economy.That is because Mr. Yi will have a boss with an equally deep background in economics and a strong political backing: Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to the president, who joined the Politburo in October. Mr. Liu is widely expected to be named on Monday as one of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s four vice premiers, with particular responsibility for overseeing the financial sector and industrial policy.The post is not new, but the man who has held the job for the past five years, Ma Kai, is a longtime central planner who appeared to spend most of his time on issues involving state-owned enterprises.In financial policy, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one thing that is very clear is that Liu He will play a more important role than Ma Kai‚<U+0080>ù did, said Jianguang Shen, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank.The rest of the world will be watching what happens. China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s continued use of economic planning and ongoing support for state-owned companies has prompted pushback by global leaders. President Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new tariffs on steel and aluminum are aimed, in part, at China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s own protectionist policies.David Malpass, the Treasury Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s under secretary for international affairs, said before the Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in Argentina on Sunday that China had reversed its path toward more open markets, in favor of greater subsidies of its industries and more shoring-up of state-owned enterprises.‚<U+0080><U+009C>China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gone in a different direction, really, from the rest of the world,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Malpass said.He also noted it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>worrisome‚<U+0080>ù that President Xi had done away with term limits, leaving him free to rule indefinitely, and that the United States‚<U+0080><U+0099> longstanding economic discussions with China had stalled.As Mr. Xi has sought to extend it leadership, he has brought more centralized control to the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s main policy levers.The government has just approved a plan to combine China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s banking and insurance regulators, as a way to bolster oversight. The agencies will relinquish some policymaking responsibilities to China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s central bank.Last summer, Mr. Xi created a Financial Stability and Development Committee to coordinate all financial regulation, and Mr. Liu is widely expected to lead it. The new committee, while small, has the power to resolve differences among the People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Bank of China and the agencies that oversee the regulation of the banking, insurance and securities industries.In 2013, the president also made Mr. Liu the director of the Communist Party‚<U+0080><U+0099>s powerful Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. A few months later, Mr. Liu named Mr. Yi as one of his deputies at the group, the state-run news media reported at the time.The rapid rise of both men once again show the president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s willingness to dispense with the conventions of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s bureaucracy when he wants to promote someone he may perceive as especially competent, especially loyal or both. Mr. Liu was promoted several rungs overnight to the Politburo last October despite having been only the deputy director of a ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission.Similarly, Mr. Yi has not followed the traditional path to a top financial position, like a stint running a big state-owned bank or overseeing one of the lesser regulators. (Mr. Zhou did both before running the central bank.)Mr. Yi worked his way up the ladder at the People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Bank of China, where he has been since 1997. The current central bank chief, who is retiring, has lately given considerable visibility to Mr. Yi by sending him to international meetings and encouraging him to answer questions at important news conferences.Mr. Yi is also among the rare officials to reach the top ranks after spending considerable time overseas. He earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and then taught economics at Indiana University in Indianapolis for eight years. Mr. Liu studied at Seton Hall University and Harvard.The job of running the People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Bank of China has become much more technical in the past several years as it has shifted away from simply mandating the interest rates that banks can charge for loans and pay for deposits. Instead, the central bank increasingly relies on open-market trading in bonds and other securities to influence interest rates, much as the Federal Reserve does in the United States.Mr. Yi has an extensive academic background in monetary policy and has overseen much of the trading in recent years. But he will face a big challenge in managing the central bank, including shifting political priorities.Through the central bank and other institutions, China tightly controls how its currency, the renminbi, is used and valued. That means limiting the amount of money that Chinese citizens and companies, both foreign and domestic, can send across its border.China has also long used its banking system as an economic throttle, unleashing waves of loans when the government wants growth and ratcheting back when debt looks out of control. The system has kept China stable in times of global economic distress. But as China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s economy has matured, cracks have begun to show.Previous efforts to juice the economy led to a startling rise in corporate debt. The system has long supported bloated, inefficient state-owned industries that many economists say are slowing down China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s development.Mr. Zhou, an urbane English speaker who frequently hobnobs with world leaders in places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has worked to gradually change China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dependence on debt and its control of its currency. Under his administration, the central bank somewhat loosened China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s grip on the value of its currency. And he has championed programs that allow money to cross borders more easily.He has also been a vocal, if diplomatic, critic of some Chinese economic policies ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a rarity in a country that values consensus. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding bank capital and risk resilience,‚<U+0080>ù he said in a statement posted on the central bank‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website on Nov. 4.But the direction of China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s economic policy ultimately comes from the top, so Mr. Liu and Mr. Yi will take their cues from the president. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an agenda that emphasizes stability and growth, meaning they will most likely focus more on China‚<U+0080><U+0099>s priorities than those of the global markets.After an exodus of capital, China tightened its limits on money flows outside the country over the past two years to bolster the value of its currency. It undermined Mr. Zhou‚<U+0080><U+0099>s efforts to loosen the reins.Now debt is a paramount focus. The central bank will need to provide just enough credit to keep the economy running but not so much that debt keeps rising and inflation eventually becomes a problem.Mr. Yi‚<U+0080><U+0099>s earliest well-known article for an economics journal, published in 1990 in the China Economic Review while he was still an assistant professor at Indiana University, had a turgid title that might prove especially useful: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Inflation and Price Instability: An Empirical Study of the People‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Republic of China.‚<U+0080>ùHYDERABAD, India ‚<U+0080><U+0094> She was awarded one of India‚<U+0080><U+0099>s highest civilian honors, brushed aside a fatwa issued against her and has traveled extensively despite threats to her safety, but on a recent Monday, Sunitha Krishnan looked a bit unnerved.A few days earlier, several women posing as sex trafficking victims engineered an attack at a shelter Ms. Krishnan oversees about 35 miles from her office outside Hyderabad, in southern India. The women stormed a nursery filled with babies, smashed windows and stabbed staff with shards of glass, injuring a few of them seriously.At her desk, Ms. Krishnan recalled a sobering moment after learning of the attack.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As I was sitting here,‚<U+0080>ù she said in an interview, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it suddenly sank in my brain: What if one of the children ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080>ù She broke off. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What if one of them is hurt? I crashed completely. I was crying and crying and crying.‚<U+0080>ùBy ‚<U+0080><U+009C>God‚<U+0080><U+0099>s grace,‚<U+0080>ù she said, none of the babies were injured.For over two decades, Ms. Krishnan has led Prajwala, an organization that rescues women and children from sex traffickers in Hyderabad and across India. The stories are horrifying. During a TED Talk, Ms. Krishnan spoke of Shaheen, a toddler who was found near railway tracks and had been raped by so many men that her intestines were outside her body.In rescue facilities, girls are fed, educated and trained to work as welders or carpenters, among other professions. The complex that was attacked has a capacity of 1,200 people, Ms. Krishnan said, making it the largest of its kind in the world.But Ms. Krishnan has made enemies, typically furious traffickers who have seen their profits dry up as girls are plucked off the streets by the police and placed in Prajwala‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shelters. Millions of women and children work as sex slaves in India.Ms. Krishnan said brushes with violence were part of her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>regular existence.‚<U+0080>ù Besides sporadic attacks on the shelters, Ms. Krishnan dodged someone who tried to throw acid on her and witnessed the murder of a staff member by a group of pimps. She said she had been assaulted 17 times.She is just 4 feet 6 inches tall, and her body bears reminders of trauma. She has a bad back and has lost most of her hearing in one ear. But these incidents have only hardened Ms. Krishnan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s resolve.When a girl is brought to a shelter, she said, the damage is bone-deep. The ‚<U+0080><U+009C>profile of the person I am getting,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Krishnan said, is someone who ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hates me, abuses me, spits on my face, doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t tell me her real name, doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t tell me her real address, is so hostile and aggressive toward me, and is happy to escape from my clutches.‚<U+0080>ùOf the 20,000 women and children that have been rescued, Ms. Krishnan said Prajwala had been able to keep tabs on 86 percent of them, with many slowly regaining their ability to trust others. The remaining number are often trafficked again.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not 100 percent successful, but we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not 100 percent a failure either,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have demonstrated to the world that it is possible to change.‚<U+0080>ùBorn in 1972 to a lower middle-class family in Bangalore, Ms. Krishnan said she stood out from a young age. There was her pain tolerance, she said, and her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>extraordinary ability to bring people together.‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Krishnan was also cunning, helping her to outmaneuver the traffickers she confronts today, she said.By her teens, Ms. Krishnan had become a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hard-core social worker.‚<U+0080>ù But her interest in working with sex-trafficked women did not develop until she was 15, when Ms. Krishnan was sexually assaulted by eight men while working on a literacy campaign in a village.It was this episode, and the anger she felt toward people who tried to write her off as a victim, that propelled Ms. Krishnan to start Prajwala.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t deny that I was a victim,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t deny that I also took a lot of space and time to recover from that. But my healing was self-determined, and that is why I call myself a survivor.‚<U+0080>ùIn the afternoon, Ms. Krishnan climbed into a truck and sped off to the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s high court, where she was meeting with a judge to discuss legislation to criminalize the buying of sex in the state of Andhra Pradesh, which includes Hyderabad.She reminisced about the past, breaking conversation to curtly steer her driver through impossibly thick traffic and to remind a reporter that the area was the perfect tinderbox for communal riots.This thought led Ms. Krishnan to recall one of her blunders. In 2012, a group of Muslims accused Ms. Krishnan of defaming women in the community by identifying them as prostitutes to secure foreign funding.In response, Ms. Krishnan asked the women to sign declarations acknowledging that they were prostitutes and that, for this reason, their children were enrolled in Ms. Krishnan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s schools. Shortly after, a mob stormed one of Prajwala‚<U+0080><U+0099>s centers and beat some of the women.‚<U+0080><U+009C>People came with swords and chains and all kinds of weapons to cut us into multiple pieces and throw us into the Musi River,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to a tributary that cuts through Hyderabad.Now Ms. Krishnan is especially conscious of protecting women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s identities, rarely granting interviews or allowing access to the shelters.As the truck inched forward, Ms. Krishnan lamented that her story was too often reduced to the sexual assault she experienced. Still, she felt it was necessary to remind people of the importance of the work.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I, a small nobody with no background, nothing, just a small little 4 feet and 6 inches, can do what I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m doing,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>then more people can do what has to be done.‚<U+0080>ùAt an entrance to the high court, Ms. Krishnan threw open her door, held up a hand to stop traffic and disappeared into the crowd.LONDON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Every Friday morning, as commuters arrived in London Victoria station, a teenage girl would board a train to Eastbourne, a coastal town about 60 miles outside the city.Dressed in her sports uniform and carrying a shoulder bag covered in badges of pop icons, she tried to give the impression that she was on her way to school. But this teenager was already three hours into her workday.Armed with a knife and carrying a large supply of Class A drugs, the 14-year-old girl had been instructed to travel to Eastbourne to sell crack and heroin.If she failed to meet steadily increasing demands set by her boss at the time, a 48-year-old gang leader who lured her through a social media app, she was either beaten or sexually assaulted.A report by a British government commission on modern slavery and human trafficking, released last month, described a sprawling practice that ensnares tens of thousands of people in Britain.Many are immigrants. But the high number of victims from Britain was an unexpected shock ‚<U+0080><U+0094> cases involving British citizens like the teenage girl were the third-largest grouping, after those involving Albanians or Vietnamese.A majority of child-trafficking victims were also found to be British.From nail salons and carwashes to farms and construction sites, thousands of vulnerable adults and children are being traded as commodities and are often subjected to violence and abuse, the report found. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We kind of let it slip that we have vulnerable people in our own communities,‚<U+0080>ù Kevin Hyland, Britain‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first independent antislavery commissioner, said in an interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And they are vulnerable for a number of reasons, not just because they come from poverty. It may be that they have learning difficulties, educational issues or addiction.‚<U+0080>ùFor months, no one noticed as the 14-year-old girl, whose identity is being concealed for her protection because her captors are still at large, sneaked out of her apartment before dawn, skipped school and came home late, once with bruises all over her body. No one saw the deep scratches on her arms and legs when she started to hurt herself.Her mother acknowledged neglecting her daughter at times, occasionally staying away from their home for several nights at a time and ignoring calls from her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s school reporting that she had failed to attend.Then, during the school holidays in July last year, the teenager disappeared. It was not until seven months later, after her mother said she had resigned herself to the fact that her daughter might be dead, that a detective told her that she had been kidnapped and enslaved.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Enslaved?‚<U+0080>ù the mother, whose identity is also being concealed to protect her daughter, recalled asking the officer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I just kept repeating that word. I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand it,‚<U+0080>ù she said in a London park where she often goes to try to manage a panic disorder that developed after her daughter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disappearance.During the months when her daughter was missing, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought about every possible scenario that could have happened to her,‚<U+0080>ù her mother said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But slavery? I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even know that happened in England.‚<U+0080>ùBritain recorded 2,255 modern slavery offenses across England and Wales last year, a 159 percent increase from the previous year. According to the government commission, the rise suggests that, while slavery might be increasing, so is awareness among the police and public. The report also said that different agencies were cooperating better.But a recent inspection of police practice found significant deficiencies and inconsistencies that left many victims exposed and vulnerable to further exploitation.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Victims who come into contact with the police are not always recognized as such and therefore remain in the hands of those who are exploiting them. Others are arrested as offenders or illegal immigrants,‚<U+0080>ù the British Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services found.Analysts say that some of the most vulnerable people are those who depend on welfare benefits and lack family life and support. As a result, they are easily influenced by people who suddenly appear in their lives.‚<U+0080><U+009C>People often get picked up when they are hanging around, either at hostels or soup kitchens,‚<U+0080>ù said Anne Read, an anti-trafficking response coordinator for the Salvation Army, a charity that manages the government support system for adult victims. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And, of course, now there is the internet, which enables predators to enter people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s homes,‚<U+0080>ù she added.That is how the teenager met her captor more than a year ago, through a messaging app on her phone.Her mother, who had just lost her job at a bakery, had cut off her weekly allowance of about $26. That caused the girl to spend less time with her friends and more time on the internet.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was broke, I couldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t do nothing,‚<U+0080>ù the girl, now 15, said in an interview with her caseworker by her side. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I got bored and started chatting to people on my phone, and that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s how I met him,‚<U+0080>ù she said, referring to her captor, who has not been taken into custody and whose real name is unknown to investigators.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was really sweet when I met him,‚<U+0080>ù she added with the slight stutter she developed in the months she was away. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He kept buying me phone credit, and told me he would look after me and teach me how to make money.‚<U+0080>ùThe first day they arranged to meet, he took her to her favorite fish and chip restaurant and ordered the large family menu, just for the two of them.The man was grooming the teenager to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>go country,‚<U+0080>ù meaning that she would become a drug runner. While most British citizens are trafficked for labor or sex, an increasing number of young people are being drawn into the drug world because of the relatively new phenomenon of distributing narcotics from urban hubs to small towns.‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we have are criminals who are predators, and who use other people as their instruments of crime,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Hyland said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They will use them however they can in whatever way they want to make money.‚<U+0080>ùThe teenager‚<U+0080><U+0099>s boss promised her about $175 for every day she worked. The gang he ran made profits of about $2,400 a day, said her caseworker, who requested anonymity because she was not allowed to speak to the news media while the investigation into the teenager‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disappearance was underway.In the first four months of working for the gang, she earned around $2,500 and received a new phone with unlimited data and a gold bracelet, which she still wears.But one day last year, after making a drug run to Eastbourne, she was told by a gang member that the police had caught her on camera and were waiting to arrest her at her home in South London.The teenager believed him.The man, whom she knew as Ziggy, took her phone and money. He then drove her to a dark, squalid garage with no windows, where she lived for the next seven months with various drug addicts.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Everything changed,‚<U+0080>ù the girl recalled. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ziggy started to beat me and told me I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t worth anything to them anymore.‚<U+0080>ùShe was then taken off the runner rotation and forced into servitude, preparing drug supplies, transferring them between houses in the area and cleaning up after the addicts who lived there.One night, as she slept on a mattress in the corner of the cold garage floor, Ziggy appeared and lay down next to her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>First he undressed me and made me do things to him, but then he raped me,‚<U+0080>ù she said, as tears streamed down her face and her hands started shaking.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought about escaping so many times, but I had nowhere to go,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I thought they would either kill me or the police would arrest me.‚<U+0080>ùWhen members of the gang and different drug addicts started to rape her every night, she finally decided that nothing could be worse. The next day, she went to a local laundromat and asked to use the phone to call the police.She returned home only after spending several months in a safe house undergoing a rehabilitation program. Her mother has had to move from their former home in South London because members of the gang that abused her daughter are still at large.The teenager‚<U+0080><U+0099>s caseworker said that the biggest challenge was to make sure she completed her recovery process. Otherwise, she could risk falling back into the hands of traffickers, which happens often with young victims.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m really happy to be back with my friends,‚<U+0080>ù the teenager said, smiling for the first time during a one-hour interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But I really miss having a phone and money.‚<U+0080>ùWhen Benjamin Glaze, at the time a 19-year-old cashier from Enid, Okla., auditioned for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Idol,‚<U+0080>ù he had hoped his big moment would come as he belted out ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stadium,‚<U+0080>ù a song he wrote himself. That or Nick Jonas‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 2015 single ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Levels.‚<U+0080>ùInstead, it came when the pop star Katy Perry, a judge on the show, surprised him by kissing him smack on the lips, moments before his audition. He had never been kissed before.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was a tad bit uncomfortable,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Glaze said by phone this week, after the incident aired on the season premiere. His first kiss was a rite of passage he had been putting off with consideration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted to save it for my first relationship,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I wanted it to be special.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Would I have done it if she said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Would you kiss me?‚<U+0080><U+0099> No, I would have said no,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I know a lot of guys would be like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Heck yeah!‚<U+0080><U+0099> But for me, I was raised in a conservative family and I was uncomfortable immediately. I wanted my first kiss to be special.‚<U+0080>ùThe scene with the kiss was part of the two-night season opener for the new ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Idol,‚<U+0080>ù which is now airing on ABC after a 15-year run on Fox. It is being judged by a new panel of celebrities ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Ms. Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and is hosted by Ryan Seacrest, who hosted the program on Fox, and is a creative consultant for the show as well.In the segments that featured Mr. Glaze, he was shown waiting around in anticipation for his audition with other hopefuls.After he entered the  studio, guitar slung over his shoulder and looking a bit star struck, he said he enjoyed his work as a cashier because it let him meet ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cute girls.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Have you kissed a girl and liked it?‚<U+0080>ù asked Mr. Bryan, making a coy reference to Ms. Perry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first hit single, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I Kissed a Girl.‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Glaze said that he had not. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have never been in a relationship and I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t kiss a girl without being in a relationship.‚<U+0080>ùAt that, Ms. Perry stood up. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Come here,‚<U+0080>ù she said to Mr. Glaze. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Come here right now.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Perry motioned for him to come over to the judges‚<U+0080><U+0099> table and stuck her face toward him. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One on the cheek?‚<U+0080>ù he said and she smiled. He quickly touched his face to her cheek. She asked for another kiss, complaining that he hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even made the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>smush sound.‚<U+0080>ù As he moved toward her cheek again, Ms. Perry swung her face toward him and kissed him quickly on the lips. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Katy!‚<U+0080>ù he yelled, as he stumbled backward. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t!‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Perry raised her arms in victory.Mr. Glaze then asked for a drink of water, delivered a lackluster audition and was kindly rejected by the judges.Even though it aired earlier this week, the audition itself took place last October and this has given Mr. Glaze, who is now 20, some time to consider the event with perspective.The kiss did result in his getting more screen time, which has helped draw attention to his music. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So in that way,‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m glad she did it because it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a great opportunity to get my music out.‚<U+0080>ùWhen he returned home, Mr. Glaze worked through his feelings about the kiss by talking to his friends. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They agreed with me that it didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t really count,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was lip contact versus a romantic situation with someone you care about. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what a real first kiss is.‚<U+0080>ùHe said he does not feel he was sexually harassed and is grateful to Ms. Perry for tweeting about him.The show‚<U+0080><U+0099>s producers embraced the footage, using it in televised promos and on social media. On the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Idol‚<U+0080>ù website, Mr. Glaze‚<U+0080><U+0099>s performance is posted under the headline ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Benjamin Glaze‚<U+0080><U+0099>s First Kiss and Audition.‚<U+0080>ù The show‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Twitter feed also posted a photograph of Mr. Glaze and wrote, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This journey has just begun, Benjamin. A kiss for good luck from @katyperry and you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re on your way.‚<U+0080>ùThe first kiss of an aw-shucks teenager from Oklahoma, delivered by a superstar singer, might have made for a sweet pop-culture moment in a previous era. But as the nation re-examines sexual conduct and power dynamics in workplaces and in the media, the kiss didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t land well with all viewers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It was a forced sexual act,‚<U+0080>ù one viewer posted in reply to the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>American Idol‚<U+0080>ù tweet: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Imagine if this was from a male judge. Has @katyperry not taken anything from the #metoo movement?‚<U+0080>ùIn the same thread, another viewer wondered if Mr. Glaze‚<U+0080><U+0099>s religious convictions had been disrespected. And many other viewers mirrored the sentiment of one fan, who wrote, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lucky son of a gun.‚<U+0080>ùRepresentatives for ABC and Katy Perry did not respond to requests for comment.How to convert acts of mass horror into live performance? In spoken theater, the oral testimony of victims, witnesses, even perpetrators, has been adapted into memorable docudramas about war crimes, genocide and other forms of social and political violence. The appalling nature of the events described has often been all the more effective when the actors speak the words in a contrastingly low-key manner.But how to adapt those horrors into dance or musical theater, genres seemingly not ready-made for such issues. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unwanted,‚<U+0080>ù at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, the choreographer and musician Doroth√©e Munyaneza, who witnessed genocide in Rwanda as a child, presents the verbatim accounts of women in several countries (Congo, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and others) who experienced militarized rape and its consequences.Ms. Munyaneza makes the experience elaborately layered. Some words are spoken, others are chanted or sung. Nonverbal music is played. Dancing and a range of physical actions express multiple aspects of trauma. At several points, technology is used to recycle music or words after a few seconds; the repetition becomes psychologically expressive of thoughts, memories and feelings that keep returning to haunt. You see just two women, Ms. Munyaneza and Holland Andrews; you also hear electronic music by Alain Mah√©.The range of idioms employed here veers between the cool objectivity of spoken docudrama and the intensely lyrical extremes of quasi-operatic mad scenes. Though madness in drama can include falsification, its main point (from Euripides and Shakespeare through Romantic opera to strands of modern drama) is to show how harsh experience causes derangement; it flicks and fragments the mind into flights and shards that reveal the effect of trauma on thought. There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a passage here in which Ms. Andrews‚<U+0080><U+0099>s vocal cadenzas feel like a modern version of a Romantic mad scene: A high soprano melodic line floats, showing the mind‚<U+0080><U+0099>s escape into a separate zone, and then, suddenly, rasping chest tones show a more violent explosion.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unwanted‚<U+0080>ù is primarily more music than dance. At times, the singing comes close to the intense outpouring of the blues. Sequences of chanting show a different way to deal with bleak facts: quietly intoning things that happened as part of history. Women who saw their mothers and friends killed were raped by those very killers; then they gave birth to children. One woman who has come to regard her rapist as a hyena. She looks at his baby in her arms and sees only a hyena: Should she kill it?Physical activities here include the slow defacing of a large poster of a glamorous African woman; angry, harsh, return-to-basic-work rhythms with pots and pestles; gentle physical care of one woman by another, as if by a nurse with a victim; and solo movement in which Ms. Munyaneza‚<U+0080><U+0099>s body flinches, arches, reels, hinges ‚<U+0080><U+0094> sent off vertical balance by unseen forces.While all of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unwanted‚<U+0080>ù is remarkable, not all of it is believable. Both Ms. Munyaneza and Ms. Andrews are virtuoso performers. There are sequences, however, when their virtuosity ‚<U+0080><U+0094> especially Ms. Munyaneza‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+0094> becomes an end in itself, showing too much relish in the wow effects she makes with clicking vocalism and off-kilter movement, as if she were a movie actor adoring the close-up in a powerful monologue.Nonetheless, this makes sophisticated and often beautifully eloquent theater. Its multiple levels are an important addition to our understanding of how art may relate what none of us long to know.If your mailbox feels like it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s just a holding cell for your trash can, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t worry: Unsubscribing from snail mail is almost as easy as unsubscribing from email spam.In fact, you can do most of it online, using a few simple services. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s kind of like the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do Not Call‚<U+0080>ù list, but for junk mail. With a few clicks and a bit of waiting, your mailbox should be home to far fewer dead trees.Let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s start with the obvious: You probably get a lot of magazines you actually signed up for, and bills from banks you actually do business with. You obviously want to keep receiving these, but before moving forward, consider what you actually need in hard copy form.To switch your magazines to digital subscriptions, just download each magazine‚<U+0080><U+0099>s corresponding app on your iPad, Android tablet, Amazon Fire or other device. Almost every magazine app should have an option in the settings for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>current subscribers‚<U+0080>ù or an option to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>verify your subscription.‚<U+0080>ù You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll just need to enter your address and the subscription number on the magazine‚<U+0080><U+0099>s delivery label, and you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to access all your current and past issues digitally. You can then head to the magazine‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website and cancel your physical delivery to enjoy digital-only reading. (If the magazine can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t verify your digital subscription, you may have a print-only account ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but you might be able to contact customer service and switch it to digital-only.)Similarly, head to your bank‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, log in with your account and find your account settings. You should be able to find a paperless billing option, which lets you get statements and other notices over email instead of snail mail.While you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re there, check your bank‚<U+0080><U+0099>s privacy preferences as well. Most, by default, share your information with other financial institutions, which in turn send you a lot of junk mail. Opt out of any information sharing and marketing communications and you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll hopefully get less of that in the future.The real junk mail, of course, isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t stuff you signed up for ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the catalogs and preapproved credit card offers that really clog your mailbox. Companies can get your name and address from lists of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>prospective customers‚<U+0080>ù their partners share with them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> stores you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve shopped at, banks you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve done business with or clubs you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve joined. Others could just be local ads distributed to every mailbox in your neighborhood.You could unsubscribe to some of these manually by contacting the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s customer service, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easier and more efficient to try and remove your name from these lists entirely.DMAChoice.org, a tool offered by the Data & Marketing Association, lets you remove your name and address from a number of these lists. After registering an account and paying a $2 fee, you can unsubscribe from entire categories of mail ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like catalogs and advertisements ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or unsubscribe from specific catalogs you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want. Catalogchoice.org is a free alternative, but only allows you to unsubscribe from catalogs one at a time ‚<U+0080><U+0094> you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t remove yourself from entire lists.Note that this won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t unsubscribe you from catalogs from businesses that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve been a customer of ‚<U+0080><U+0094> only ones where you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>prospect.‚<U+0080>ù If you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve actually purchased a product from a company, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have to visit their website and unsubscribe from their catalog manually through customer service.Lastly, in order to unsubscribe from those preapproved credit and insurance offers, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll need to sign up for OptOutPrescreen.com, a service offered by the major credit bureaus. You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll need to give them some information, including your Social Security number, but don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t worry ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a legitimate service, recommended by the Federal Trade Commission. You can opt out of these offers for five years online, or you can mail in a form to opt out permanently.Not everyone is great about changing their address when they move. When you move to a new house or apartment, you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably get occasional mailings intended for the previous residents ‚<U+0080><U+0094> but those should slow down eventually. If you keep getting them months or years later, however, you have a few options.First, resist the temptation to throw these away. It won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t solve the problem, and in some cases it could even be illegal. Instead, cross out all bar codes on the envelope (so it doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get automatically sorted), write ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Return to sender: Recipient moved‚<U+0080>ù on the front and stick it back in the mailbox. This will send it back to the Post Office and hopefully back to the original sender, so they won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t keep mailing stuff to your address.If things are really bad, you can fill out a change of address form for the previous occupant with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Left No Forwarding Address‚<U+0080>ù in place of the new residence, or file a complaint with the postmaster. Hopefully, in most cases, this won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be necessary.After going through the above steps, you won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily see a decrease in junk mail right away. Almost all of these mailings will take a few weeks or a few months to stop, since they‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll have already been prepared ahead of time. But over time, you should see the junk mail slow to a trickle.Not everything is so easily stopped, unfortunately. You may still get mailings for local businesses, charities you‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve donated to or other mailings that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t use the above lists. For the remaining stragglers, sort them into a separate pile (instead of throwing them away) and try contacting each sender directly. You can also download Paper Karma, which will let you take a photo of the mailing with your smartphone, and then attempt to do all the unsubscribing work for you.Michael W. Ferro Jr., a Chicago entrepreneur and the biggest shareholder in the newspaper publisher Tronc, has stepped down as the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chairman, Tronc announced on Monday, hours before the publication of a report in which two women accused him of inappropriate sexual advances.Justin Dearborn, the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief executive, will replace Mr. Ferro as chairman. The move was made just weeks after Mr. Ferro helped negotiate the sale of Tronc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crown jewel, The Los Angeles Times.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am confident that under the leadership of Justin and the rest of the board and management team Tronc will continue to deliver value for investors while executing the plan for digital transformation,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Ferro said in a statement.Later on Monday, Fortune magazine published an article in which two women made separate on-the-record accusations that Mr. Ferro had acted inappropriately toward them during private encounters. Neither woman worked for Mr. Ferro, though they said their interactions with him had been for professional reasons.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Over more than 20 years of leading public companies and other enterprises, Michael Ferro has never had a claim filed against him nor a settlement made on his behalf,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Ferro‚<U+0080><U+0099>s spokesman, Dennis Culloton said in a statement to Fortune that was later sent to The New York Times. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Your on-the-record allegations appear to involve private conduct with private individuals who were not employees of Tronc or any other company he ran.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As recently announced, Mr. Ferro has retired back to private life after leading a financial turnaround of Tronc as the non-executive chairman,‚<U+0080>ù the statement continued. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There will, therefore, be no other comment.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Ferro will remain an investor in Tronc and, through another one of his companies, Merrick Ventures, will maintain a consulting position that will pay him $5 million a year through 2020.Mr. Ferro resigned after a period of intense public scrutiny. Dissatisfaction at The Los Angeles Times spilled into public view early this year, with some employees at the paper fearing that Tronc and Mr. Ferro were making hires in order to try to form a separate unit that would sidestep a newsroom that had recently unionized.Also, Ross Levinsohn, who had been consulting for Tronc before becoming the publisher of The Times, was placed on leave after National Public Radio reported that he had been accused of sexual harassment at two previous jobs. After an investigation that Tronc said had found no wrongdoing, Mr. Levinsohn was reinstated as chief executive of a newly formed division called Tribune Interactive.In early February, Mr. Ferro orchestrated the sale of The Los Angeles Times to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire doctor in Los Angeles, for $500 million. The deal, which is expected to close soon, also included The Times‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sibling paper, The San Diego Union-Tribune, and smaller publications in the California News Group.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Michael retires having created considerable shareholder value for the company in just two years as chairman of the board,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Dearborn said in a statement.Mr. Coulton, the spokesman for Mr. Ferro, said Mr. Ferro was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>burned out‚<U+0080>ù by his high profile and wanted to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>go out on a win.‚<U+0080>ù But that was before the accusations against Mr. Ferro became public.An audacious businessman and former owner of The Chicago Sun-Times, Mr. Ferro became Tronc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nonexecutive chairman in early 2016 after his fund, Merrick Ventures, invested $44 million in the company.Almost immediately, he began to transform Tronc, the publisher of The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers, sometimes to the bewilderment of its journalists and the rest of the media industry.During a lengthy takeover battle with Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, Mr. Ferro changed the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s name from Tribune Publishing to Tronc, for Tribune online content, a move that was met with ridicule on the internet. He also introduced a technology-driven approach to journalism that included the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. And he harbored global ambitions, with plans to open bureaus for The Los Angeles Times in cities around the world, including Lagos, Nigeria, and Rio de Janeiro.In September, Tronc acquired The  Daily News, the nearly 100-year-old tabloid that was long a voice for New York‚<U+0080><U+0099>s working class.Nowhere did Tronc‚<U+0080><U+0099>s decisions draw more criticism than at The Los Angeles Times. Last year, the company aggressively tried to thwart a unionization effort by the paper‚<U+0080><U+0099>s workers, aggravating tension between employees and management. The company also installed new leaders, including Mr. Levinsohn, a former Yahoo executive, and Lewis D‚<U+0080><U+0099>Vorkin, previously the chief product officer at Forbes, who became the paper‚<U+0080><U+0099>s editor. Neither endeared himself to a newsroom that became set on their ousters.Newsroom employees at The Times also made public online reports about Tronc, including the compensation and perks received by executives, as well as Mr. Ferro‚<U+0080><U+0099>s use of a private jet that Tronc had paid to sublease from Merrick Ventures. A regulatory disclosure in December that Tronc had agreed to pay Merrick Ventures $5 million annually on a rolling, three-year basis for consulting services also vexed employees.Last week, Tronc laid off a number of employees at The Chicago Tribune, including its only reporter in Washington, leaving the paper without a correspondent in the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s capital. As part of the sale of The Los Angeles Times, Tronc sold its Washington bureau to Dr. Soon-Shiong.Even at a time of year when movie companies typically unload their dross, the sheer awfulness of Dito Montiel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Clapper‚<U+0080>ù stands out. Adapting his second book (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eddie Krumble Is the Clapper‚<U+0080>ù), Mr. Montiel ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a former punk musician whose memoir, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,‚<U+0080>ù was filmed in 2006 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> fails completely to transform sad-sack characters into interesting ones.Instead, he presents them as borderline dolts, barely functioning adults defined by behavioral quirks and psychological soft spots. Eddie (Ed Helms) and his buddy Chris (an unusually restrained, possibly mortified Tracy Morgan) are bottom-feeding actors in Hollywood whose specialty is playing audience members on low-budget television shows. Clapping and hollering on cue ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and sometimes, if they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re lucky, asking a prearranged question ‚<U+0080><U+0094> they survive with minimal income and even less ambition.Theirs is a livelihood that depends on blending into the crowd. So when Eddie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ubiquity is spotted and exposed by a late-night television host (Russell Peters), he becomes a running joke and essentially unemployable. The notoriety also threatens to derail his painfully dimwitted pursuit of Judy (Amanda Seyfried), a sweetly simple gas-station cashier with a fondness for weird humans and wounded animals.Mashing limp romance and artless satire into a ludicrously contrived plot, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Clapper‚<U+0080>ù lurches from one mirthlessly eccentric scene to another.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sometimes at night it feels like all the normal people just disappear,‚<U+0080>ù Judy says, wistfully. Sometimes in movies it feels exactly the same way.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> When Kevin Carwile arrived to run the Justice Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s death penalty unit in 2010, he had never prosecuted or sat through an entire capital punishment case. He was moved into the job after overseeing the gangs unit, and some prosecutors worried he lacked the expertise to steer the division.Now Mr. Carwile has been removed from his post after The New York Times inquired about a series of grievances against him, including complaints that he promoted gender bias and a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sexualized environment.‚<U+0080>ù He fostered a culture of favoritism and sexism, according to court records, internal documents and interviews with more than a half-dozen current and former employees. In one episode, his deputy groped an administrative assistant at a bar in view of their colleagues, according to some who were present. Mr. Carwile asked the witnesses to keep it secret, one said.Employees of the unit, the capital case section, complained about the issues to Justice Department officials, the inspector general and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at least 12 times. Some allegations went unaddressed for years. In cases that were investigated, the accusers were never told what investigators found. Both Mr. Carwile and his deputy, Gwynn Kinsey, remained Justice Department employees despite the inquiries.Six employees, including the administrative assistant, said they eventually left the section or quit government altogether in part because of the toxic climate. A defendant in Indiana has asked in court for the government to drop the death penalty recommendation in his case because of the unit‚<U+0080><U+0099>s emerging conduct issues.Mr. Carwile declined to comment. After The Times contacted the Justice Department for this article, he was demoted and detailed to a different division. Through his lawyers, Mr. Kinsey declined to comment.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Department of Justice takes these allegations extremely seriously but cannot discuss specific employee disciplinary actions, or comment on internally handled personnel actions or matters that may impact personal privacy,‚<U+0080>ù said Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman. The department confirmed that it referred some allegations made by employees to the inspector general, whose spokesman would not confirm or deny any investigation.The unit is poised to gain power. President Trump has suggested the United States start executing drug dealers, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has urged prosecutors to seek the death penalty whenever possible in drug-related crimes.The Justice Department created the capital case section in 1998 to help the attorney general decide when to apply capital punishment. The section‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prosecutors advise or work with trial teams on cases and a few trials a year. They were involved in some high-profile prosecutions like those of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers, and Dylann S. Roof, who was convicted in 2016 of murdering nine people at an African-American church in South Carolina.As the death penalty fell out of favor in the United States, the influence of the unit, already one of the smallest in the Justice Department, waned. About half a dozen trial lawyers worked there in the beginning of 2012, along with a lawyer conducting protocol reviews and three others on loan from different parts of the department.Mr. Carwile had arrived just before the public learned of the Fast and Furious scandal, a botched operation in which agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives let criminals move guns across the border into Mexico to try to build a bigger case. Many of the firearms were later found at crime scenes. Mr. Carwile incorrectly told superiors that the A.T.F. learned about guns moving illegally only after the fact, according to a subsequent inspector general investigation. He was moved from his post as head of the gangs unit to the much smaller capital punishment division.He quickly gained a reputation as a mercurial manager with a hands-off style that bordered on neglect, according to current and former employees. He rarely responded to emails, four former employees said, and in meetings his questions revealed that he had not read their messages.But after his first year, Mr. Carwile received the Excellence in Management award for the criminal division as the section‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers prosecuted more cases.In 2013, Jacabed Rodriguez-Coss, a prosecutor who had herself won one of the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s highest awards, complained to human resources that Mr. Carwile expected her to involuntarily travel far more than her male counterparts.Though she lived in Connecticut and had cases in Rhode Island and Vermont, he assigned her to one in California. She protested that her family needed her nearby. Her husband, an F.B.I. agent, was one of the first on the scene of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and was confronting the aftermath of having worked on the case.Ms. Rodriguez-Coss filed a complaint to the E.E.O.C., which notified the Justice Department. Mr. Carwile subsequently suspended permission for her to work from Connecticut. She sued the department in 2016, accusing him of gender discrimination and claiming that her permission to work in Connecticut was taken away in retaliation for her complaints.Seven men and women from the unit filed declarations in her support. Two male colleagues said that they had not been assigned so much travel. Bruce R. Hegyi, a former prosecutor, wrote that he left because of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>plainly unethical and improper conduct.‚<U+0080>ùHe said in his filing that Mr. Carwile promoted ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a sexualized environment,‚<U+0080>ù took him to a restaurant with scantily clad waitresses and let a fellow prosecutor show naked photographs of a woman during a work gathering of both men and women.Other employees said in their declarations that Mr. Carwile held men-only meetings, sent emails only to men and assigned more desirable and high-profile cases to men. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Women only go to law school to find rich husbands,‚<U+0080>ù he said, according to a declaration filed by one lawyer, Amanda Haines.Under Mr. Carwile, there was incentive ‚<U+0080><U+009C>not to stir things up,‚<U+0080>ù said Kevin Little, the lawyer representing Ms. Rodriguez-Coss.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My client and other of her colleagues feared retaliation,‚<U+0080>ù he said.The Justice Department said in its response that Ms. Rodriguez-Coss‚<U+0080><U+0099>s claims ‚<U+0080><U+009C>boil down to her admitted refusal to perform the essential requirements of her position,‚<U+0080>ù which included taking on cases that required travel.Around the same time, Ms. Haines, who worked as a federal prosecutor for 18 years before joining the division, alerted Mr. Carwile to persistent work-quality issues, warnings that she later described in a court filing.In one case in Pennsylvania, she said, she received no files describing the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s work by the previous prosecutor, despite numerous requests, and dozens of boxes with discovery materials had sat unreviewed.She told Mr. Carwile and Mr. Kinsey, but the problem went unaddressed. Her colleague instead received a plum assignment: the Boston Marathon bombing trial.In the Indiana case, Ms. Haines said her predecessor interviewed over a dozen witnesses without a law enforcement officer or other witness present, an error that could jeopardize the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s work. She said in a legal filing that the prosecutor, who later won a departmental award, destroyed his interview notes, which he initially denied but later acknowledged.After Ms. Haines took her concerns to Mr. Carwile, a colleague shared them in an email with Sung-Hee Suh, then the deputy assistant attorney general.Ms. Haines also described the errors in a declaration filed in Ms. Rodriguez-Coss‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawsuit. After her accusations became public, defense lawyers in the Indiana case pushed back on the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recommendation to seek the death penalty for their client, Andrew Rogers, a felon accused of tying up his cellmate and stabbing him to death.The notes the prosecutor is accused of destroying could have been the difference ‚<U+0080><U+009C>between a verdict for life and a verdict for death,‚<U+0080>ù the defense wrote in a brief in January.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you pull on the thread, who knows how many cases could be impacted?‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Little, Ms. Rodriguez-Coss‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer.Two years ago, another prosecutor in the section, Ann Carroll, was asked to travel for work after she had surgery. Around that time, she learned that a male colleague was allowed to forgo travel to accommodate his gluten intolerance.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Over the 20 years I had worked at the Department of Justice, I had never experienced a complete lack of sensitivity in the immediate aftermath of a serious medical illness,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Carroll wrote in a declaration. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I felt Mr. Carwile‚<U+0080><U+0099>s response was arbitrary, and gender-based.‚<U+0080>ù She quit that June.Before departing, Ms. Carroll said she described ethical violations to Ms. Suh, prompting a management review. Four former and current employees said in court declarations and to The Times that they told Ms. Suh and James Mann, the chief of staff to the head of the Criminal Division at the Justice Department, about the mishandled cases, sexualized culture and gender bias.Ms. Suh ultimately said that Mr. Carwile and Mr. Kinsey, as a result of the review, were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>now doing their best,‚<U+0080>ù according to Mr. Hegyi‚<U+0080><U+0099>s declaration, and she concluded that employees were unhappy because they wanted to work from home, to choose between trials and case reviews, and to be given more ways to bring concerns to management.Her conclusions dumbfounded employees who said they had shared more serious grievances. A person briefed on the matter said they were not told of steps being taken to address complaints because those were confidential.Ms. Suh, who now works at the asset manager Pimco, said she could not comment on the details of pending litigation or personnel matters. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Any allegations of misconduct, discrimination, harassment or bias actually brought to my attention were fully and fairly investigated and addressed appropriately,‚<U+0080>ù she said.The years of warnings that their bosses had ignored or condoned misconduct came to a head last May. During a work-sanctioned happy hour at a restaurant near the Justice Department, colleagues watched Mr. Kinsey grope the administrative assistant, Alyssa tenBroek.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mr. Kinsey, who is a married man, began to take what seemed very clearly to be unwelcome liberties of a physical, sexual nature,‚<U+0080>ù Luke Woolman, an intern at the time, wrote in his declaration. He said Mr. Kinsey repeatedly touched Ms. tenBroek, whom he identified as A.T., ‚<U+0080><U+009C>inappropriately, openly and obviously‚<U+0080>ù in front of patrons, Mr. Carwile and at least one other Justice Department prosecutor.Mr. Woolman and the prosecutor, Sonia Jimenez, suggested everyone go home, he later told Ms. Haines. Ms. Jimenez tried to discourage Mr. Kinsey from trying to persuade Ms. tenBroek to go to a hotel with him, according to an internal memo by Ms. Haines.As the night wound down, Mr. Carwile pulled aside Mr. Woolman and asked him not to tell anyone what he had seen.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He sternly reiterated his request, specifically stating that he was being serious,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Woolman wrote.After that night, tensions in the unit exploded into view. Ms. tenBroek showed colleagues text messages from Mr. Kinsey in which he offered to give her money, pay her bills or take her on a trip. He also sent her photos of herself that he had downloaded from the internet.He signed off ‚<U+0080><U+009C>XOXOXOX,‚<U+0080>ù according to Ms. Haines‚<U+0080><U+0099>s memo. In other messages, he appeared to apologize.Ms. tenBroek later told Ms. Haines and Julie Mosley, another prosecutor, that Mr. Kinsey groped her again in the cab and tried to coerce her into checking into a hotel.Ms. Mosley told the E.E.O.C., and Ms. Haines sent her memo to superiors at the Justice Department. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I trust you will give this matter the serious attention it deserves,‚<U+0080>ù she wrote. Mr. Woolman said in a court filing that he shared his story with Mr. Mann and an investigator from the inspector general‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office.Ms. tenBroek did not dispute her co-workers‚<U+0080><U+0099> accounts and said in a statement that she had participated in the department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>lengthy and taxing‚<U+0080>ù complaint process. She has since left the agency.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have always wanted to pursue a career with the Department of Justice, but it failed me when I reported misconduct,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No woman should feel compelled to deal with the pervasive harassment that I experienced, much less have her complaint be effectively disregarded.‚<U+0080>ùThe department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s inspector general began investigating, and Mr. Kinsey was demoted and moved to another division. He is appealing. A person close to Mr. Kinsey said that evidence in another investigation is favorable to him, but would not say who was conducting that inquiry.Current and former employees said the public understandably expects death penalty cases to be handled with integrity. As Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump push for more capital punishments, the section‚<U+0080><U+0099>s history, they say, could work against the Justice Department.The same month as the happy hour, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, sent a memo to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Sexual harassment, he wrote, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>profoundly affects the victim and affects the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reputation, undermines the agency‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility, and lowers employee productivity and morale.‚<U+0080>ùMASSAPEQUA, N.Y. ‚<U+0080><U+0094> The elders of Columbus Lodge 2143 of the Order Sons of Italy in America here on the South Shore of Long Island had settled into their daily poker game on Wednesday when Joseph Saladino, the supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay, came in to say hello.Mr. Saladino, a Republican, and the club‚<U+0080><U+0099>s members had a message for the liberal Democrats who lead New York City and have raised questions about whether to take down the statue of Christopher Columbus that presides over Columbus Circle in Manhattan, motivated by claims about the Italian-born explorer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s dishonorable past.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want it, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll take it here,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Saladino, eliciting nods of agreement from the card-playing members. In fact, local leaders already have a plan to display any and all evicted Columbus statues in a prominent spot here.Mr. Saladino said he and many of his constituents were upset that municipalities around the nation were re-evaluating Columbus‚<U+0080><U+0099>s place in history and allowing the Italian explorer to be drawn into a national movement to remove Confederate monuments. The movement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s scope has expanded to other memorialized figures with controversial pasts, prompting a review ordered by Mayor Bill de Blasio of the status of controversial landmarks.Fearing that the Columbus Circle statue might be imperiled, Mr. Saladino and other political leaders in the Republican-leaning Town of Oyster Bay held a public event this week along with several Italian-American groups, to denounce Mr. de Blasio‚<U+0080><U+0099>s move and declare that Columbus remains a hero to Italian-Americans in Massapequa and other communities within the broader Town of Oyster Bay.They issued a news release calling upon Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and other radical mayors around the nation to not remove their statues of Christopher Columbus.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Saladino said that Massapequa, a heavily Italian-American town a 30-minute drive from Queens, was happy to step up as a refuge for discarded monuments to a historical figure who he said was maligned by revisionist history and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>political correctness gone awry.‚<U+0080>ùFrank Gatto, a member of the Sons of Italy lodge, and a past president, said members wanted the Columbus Circle statue to remain, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but if they take it down, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll take it here in Massapequa.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Removing the Christopher Columbus statue is a slight against Italian-Americans,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that the lodge would raise funds to transport any such statues and erect them in a small park called the Massapequa Triangle, nicknamed ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Heart of Massapequa.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Saladino, a former New York State assemblyman, also expressed outrage at the defacing of a Columbus statue inside Central Park this month, and said the statue would certainly be safe in Massapequa.He also took issue with New York City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, and her recent call for the removal of the Columbus Circle statue. The speaker cited historical accounts that blame the explorer for implementing horrendous systems of enslavement, torture and the genocide of indigenous people.He contended that Columbus actually took the tough stance of punishing crew members who committed transgressions.‚<U+0080><U+009C>That sounds like a progressive to me,‚<U+0080>ù said Mr. Saladino, whose father helped found the local Columbus Lodge.Mr. Gatto also took issue with contemporary assessments of Columbus.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re looking at a culture 500 years ago and none of us were there to know what really happened, so for Mayor de Blasio or any mayor in this country to remove a Columbus statue based on that, is a disgrace,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that Mr. de Blasio ‚<U+0080><U+009C>should be proud of his Italian heritage but should be ashamed of himself.‚<U+0080>ùHe said the lodge honored Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last Sunday as the grand marshal of the lodge‚<U+0080><U+0099>s annual Italian Feast and Festival in Massapequa, where the governor brought smiles by appearing and reiterating his opinion that the Columbus Circle statue should remain.After a movement last month to pull down Confederate memorials intensified across the country, and a woman was killed during a clash over a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. de Blasio convened a commission to study some public statues and monuments, and to develop guidelines on how the city should address ‚<U+0080><U+009C>monuments seen as oppressive and inconsistent with the values of New York City.‚<U+0080>ùMr. de Blasio speaks proudly of his Italian heritage and in his first year in office visited his grandparents‚<U+0080><U+0099> home villages in Italy. Regarding Columbus, however, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some things to be proud of, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some things to not be proud of,‚<U+0080>ù he told reporters last month.He has avoided taking a stance on the Columbus statue issue until the commission‚<U+0080><U+0099>s completes its work. The group‚<U+0080><U+0099>s findings for various memorials could range from recommending no action, to recommending the addition of an educational plaque, to deciding that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>something isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t appropriate anymore,‚<U+0080>ù the mayor has said.A spokeswoman for the mayor, Natalie Grybauskas, responding to the concerns of Mr. Saldino and others here, said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We have no plans to do anything to the Columbus statue, much less move it to Long Island.‚<U+0080>ùUnited States Representative Peter King, the Republican congressman whose district includes Massapequa and other parts of the Town of Oyster Bay, said he would also welcome any unwanted Columbus statues, and that Mr. Saladino was rightly ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fed up with political correctness‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pandering by progressives‚<U+0080>ù in New York City and elsewhere on this issue.Mr. King said he supported the supervisor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stance against ‚<U+0080><U+009C>this attempt by liberals and progressives to either rewrite history or just focus on the negative aspects‚<U+0080>ù by re-evaluating political figures.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The point is that life in the 15th century was very different than it is today and you could go through every leader in American history and judge them by the standards of a different time,‚<U+0080>ù he said.But not all Town of Oyster Bay residents agree. Lourdes Caban, 41, a hairdresser who works at a salon near the Triangle, said she grew up in Puerto Rico with the belief that Columbus was more of a conqueror of the native Taino people than a discoverer.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think people should be looking up to him,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He killed the Indians there and took their gold, so in my eyes he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not a hero. But this is an Italian town, so nobody minds it.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Caban, who lives nearby in Hicksville, called it ironic that Columbus statues are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all over Puerto Rico.‚<U+0080>ù The one in Columbus Circle should be removed, she said, but relocating it to Massapequa would only bring protests out to Long Island.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If they put it up here,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to have controversy here.‚<U+0080>ùSHAH PORIR DWIP, Bangladesh ‚<U+0080><U+0094> A skinny finger of water separates Bangladesh from Myanmar, and the other night a group of men sat on the Bangladeshi side, peering into the darkness, wondering what was left for them.For these men, ethnic Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, there is certainly nothing back across the water. Home doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t exist anymore. Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s army wiped out their villages in August, turning their houses, their mosques, their corrals, their grain stores, their fields, even their trees into dunes of ash.The muddy camps just inside Bangladesh, where more than 600,000 Rohingya have since fled, provide no solution, either.Officials from Bangladesh, a very crowded country, insist that Myanmar must take the Rohingya back. But Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Buddhist majority drove them out in the first place, creating a climate of hate that vilified the Rohingya as subhuman. Many people in Myanmar insist the Rohingya are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for hundreds of years.Few ethnic groups on earth have been locked into such hopeless logic, marooned on an international border, unwanted by either side, weary, traumatized, desperately stateless, their very origins in dispute.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Rohingya are the wretched of the earth,‚<U+0080>ù said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, the agency helping coordinate relief efforts. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nobody wants them. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m talking about 7-year-olds who have witnessed their parents get their throats slit who are standing in bare feet on the border right now, asking: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>What‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to happen to me?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùBangladesh and Myanmar have held rounds of talks about what to do with the refugees, without any Rohingya representatives present. Likewise, the United Nations recently convened a major event in Geneva called the Pledging Conference for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis. Dozens of donor nations and aid agencies were invited but no Rohingya refugees.Many Rohingya now worry that without any input from them, their fate is being sealed. It is clear where most would stand if they were consulted.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will never go back to Myanmar,‚<U+0080>ù said an older Rohingya woman named Morjan who spends her days under a plastic sheet in a camp. After her husband and son were slaughtered in front of her, she fled to Bangladesh. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Better you kill us here,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Bangladeshi officials have circulated a draft repatriation agreement, specifying how to verify that Rohingya refugees, many of whom are illiterate and do not have a piece of paper to their name, are from Myanmar. The proposal talks of a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>first batch‚<U+0080>ù of returnees and even mentions logistics and transport.But Western aid officials said privately that this was a charade. The Rohingya would not be returning to Myanmar anytime soon, the aid officials said. But nobody was allowed to come out and say that, because it could alienate Bangladesh, which clearly does not want to host the refugees indefinitely but whose good will is needed right now.Further complicating things, analysts said, was Myanmar stalling the efforts to help the Rohingya, hardly surprising considering how this crisis started. Witnesses have described, in disturbing detail, how Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s army burned down Rohingya village after Rohingya village, terrorizing and massacring civilians ‚<U+0080><U+0094> of any age, including infants ‚<U+0080><U+0094> with one apparent purpose: to erase the Rohingya from the landscape.The violence is not even over. One Rohingya advocacy group said this week that Rohingya homes were still being burned to the ground.Each night here on the border, hundreds of Rohingya keep arriving in fleets of wooden boats that float silently across the mouth of the Naf River, the brackish waterway that separates the two countries.A group of New York Times journalists waited in the darkness alongside worried family members as a searchlight on the Myanmar side swung back and forth, back and forth, an eerie metronome moving across the gloom.‚<U+0080><U+009C>How can we talk about repatriation?‚<U+0080>ù asked Tun Khin, one of the few Western-educated Rohingya representatives who have been able to reach out to the international news media. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People are still fleeing.‚<U+0080>ùBangladesh now finds itself in an impossible situation. One of Asia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s poorest countries, it is home to 160 million people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> half the population of the United States ‚<U+0080><U+0094> squeezed into a space the size of Iowa. The Rohingya refugees have taken over hillsides, chopped down countless trees to build their shelters and put such a stress on the economy of Bangladeshi border villages that prices have shot up threefold, angering longstanding residents.Facing international pressure to host the refugees and some domestic pressure to push them out, Bangladesh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said that her country would continue to help the refugees on humanitarian grounds but that Myanmar must ‚<U+0080><U+009C>take their nationals back.‚<U+0080>ùShe has ordered the army to seal off roads around the camps to make sure Rohingya do not start migrating to towns. Her government has also decreed that Rohingya were not allowed to work or register for local cellphone service.With no way to support themselves, the Rohingya refugees are completely dependent on aid. United Nations agencies such as the World Food Program have been feeding them, while international and Bangladeshi charities have provided medical care, plastic tarps, cooking pots and other basics.How long the Rohingya are expected to stay will affect the next set of issues, including questions like whether Bangladesh or outside groups should begin building schools for them.Many Bangladeshis worry that the Rohingya are perfect candidates to be radicalized ‚<U+0080><U+0094> victims of anti-Muslim persecution who are now idle and dispossessed. Retaliation is a theme for the Islamic State and countless other Islamist militant groups, including the Rohingya group that attacked the security forces in Myanmar on Aug. 25, the Arakhan Rohingya Salvation Army.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If they stay where they are living now,‚<U+0080>ù said Anup Kumar Chakma, a retired Bangladeshi Army officer, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the entire area will become a fertile breeding ground.‚<U+0080>ùAnd not only fertile for terrorist recruiters, but also for human traffickers, criminal gangs, prostitution rings ‚<U+0080><U+0094> anyone who preys on the vulnerable.For Rohingya, the conditions in Bangladesh are an uncomfortable echo of the apartheidlike system they were put under in Myanmar, the result of a long campaign of marginalization and dehumanization.For decades, the Rohingya have been pushed around this shoulder area of Asia where the Indian subcontinent and the Southeast Asian peninsula meet. Their lowly status and history of being demonized allowed this latest crisis to happen, analysts say.If the British had drawn the colonial border between what is now Myanmar and Bangladesh a little farther east and south, as Rohingya leaders had pleaded for after World War II, the biggest Rohingya areas would have been become part of Bangladesh. That would have made sense in several ways: the Rohingya are Muslim, like the vast majority of Bangladesh, and their language and culture are very similar.But scholars say that to appease the majority Buddhists and get out of Myanmar as quickly as possible, the British decided to follow the old borders of an extinct Buddhist kingdom. This kept the Rohingya inside Myanmar, where most people are very different ethnically and religiously from them.Myanmar‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leaders steadily stripped away their rights, making it extremely difficult for Rohingya to get a government job or a passport, go to school or even be legally married. Government soldiers preyed upon them; revered Buddhist monks openly called them insects and snakes.All this, looking back on it, seems to have been building up to August, when the Rohingya suffered the most comprehensive assault on their existence.According to dozens of witnesses and human rights groups, after Rohingya militants attacked a string of police posts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> mostly using farm implements as weapons ‚<U+0080><U+0094> government troops rounded up and killed hundreds of Rohingya civilians, creating a panicked exodus.Many poured into Shah Porir Dwip, a border crossing and notorious smuggling den somewhat disguised by a collection of scruffy tea shops. It lies just across the water from Myanmar. The air smells heavy here, the odor of rotting fruit cutting through the salty breeze.Each evening, Rohingya men sit on a crumbled walkway near the beach, waiting for family members still trying to get out. By 9 p.m., the boats usually start arriving. Without a sound, they materialize from the murk, rowing in from the Myanmar side, engines off, for stealth.On a recent night, one of the heaviest, hundreds of Rohingya refugees splashed out. Many were quiet, and some wept as they waded ashore.It was difficult to tell which men had reunited with their families and which had to return to the camps alone.In the darkness, walking slowly up the beach, the group moved as one.PARIS ‚<U+0080><U+0094> From the all-powerful president with the infallible touch, Emmanuel Macron has become the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>president of the rich,‚<U+0080>ù an elitist dispensing fiscal goodies to the wealthy. At least that is what parliamentarians, some economists, television interviewers and newspapers have been calling him in recent weeks.Barely six months into his presidency, Mr. Macron has been brought down from the heights to places many French are deeply suspicious of: the corporate suite and the banker‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office. Over and over that unflattering label ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>president of the rich‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> has been affixed to the young leader.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You are committing violence with your policy. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s you that are going after the poor to give to the rich!‚<U+0080>ù thundered Fran√ßois Ruffin, a firebrand of the leftist France Unbowed party.Mr. Macron was guilty of a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>heavy moral, economic, and historical sin,‚<U+0080>ù the best-selling economist Thomas Piketty wrote in the newspaper Le Monde. From the populist far right: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nothing guarantees that more rich in our society will reduce poverty,‚<U+0080>ù said Emmanuelle M√©nard, a lawmaker affiliated with the National Front.For all the thunder, however, Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, is moving fast in the early days of his unexpected presidency to overhaul his country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wary relationship with capitalism.His reforms ‚<U+0080><U+0094> major overhauls of France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s labor market, along with symbolic changes in fiscal policy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are so far unchecked. Union demonstrations against him have fizzled. He has divided French labor, nearly a first in the Fifth Republic, by compromising on his reforms.But he has also maintained the essence of what he wanted: more flexibility for individual firms in carving out agreements with workers. Mr. Macron‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plans have sailed through a Parliament with a big presidential majority, against a fragmented right and left.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For now, he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s winning the game, no point in hiding it,‚<U+0080>ù Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, leader of France Unbowed, said in a television interview last weekend.Still, the new French president‚<U+0080><U+0099>s popularity ratings bounce up and down ‚<U+0080><U+0094> helped by a political persona that remains awkward outside the realm of the successful, and by speeches that are not always sensitive to class resentments.Mr. Macron‚<U+0080><U+0099>s encounters with workers are often tense. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Do-nothings,‚<U+0080>ù he called critics in one recent speech; ‚<U+0080><U+009C>people who are nothing,‚<U+0080>ù he said in another, referring to those ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one passes‚<U+0080>ù in train stations.Last week the 39-year-old president ‚<U+0080><U+0094> successful at virtually every step in his rapid career trajectory ‚<U+0080><U+0094> got a rapturous reception at an elite engineering school outside Paris. It was easy to see that Mr. Macron, all smiles, was in his element.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This business of being the president of the rich,‚<U+0080>ù said Hugo Sevillia, 23, a student at Centrale Sup√©lec in Saclay. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It makes people mad who aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t doing well, but I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fair.‚<U+0080>ùMuch of the hue and cry is over Mr. Macron‚<U+0080><U+0099>s proposal to reduce a tax on the rich known here as the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Solidarity Tax on Wealth‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in French, the Imp√¥t de Solidarit√© sur la Fortune, or I.S.F.The government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s income from the tax is relatively modest. The tax‚<U+0080><U+0099>s real value is its symbolism ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an emotional, longstanding one ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in a country where wealth is often perceived as synonymous with injustice.No president until Mr. Macron has dared go after the wealth tax since it was created, in a different form, under the first government of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, a Socialist, in 1982.The tax aims at assets ‚<U+0080><U+0094> financial, property and otherwise ‚<U+0080><U+0094> above $1.52 million (1.3 million euros). Everybody with holdings above that sum has had to pay up, on a progressive scale: The more you own, the more you pay.This type of wealth tax has been eliminated almost everywhere else in the developed world. In Sweden, among other places, the elimination has had no effect on inequality, and there are signs it has actually spurred growth.Meanwhile, in France the wealth tax has accounted for less than 2 percent of the government‚<U+0080><U+0099>s total tax revenues. Mr. Macron and his economists contend it is nonetheless important to reduce the tax because the tranche is sliced off those accumulating capital. Capital gains will now be taxed at a flat 30 percent under Mr. Macron‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plan, nearly half the previous maximum rate.Mr. Macron argues that he is merely trying to free capital for much-needed investment in France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s slow-growth, high-unemployment economy.His policies have nothing to do with setting one class off against another ‚<U+0080><U+0094> far from it, he insists. It is all about overturning the fraying, much despised, but paradoxically cherished status quo.In a defiant recent television interview, Mr. Macron ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a president who has by now shown himself unafraid of sacred cows ‚<U+0080><U+0094> clenched his fists, waved his arms and showed no signs of retreating.Still, for all the criticism, some have defended his intentions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The I.S.F. is purely a symbol,‚<U+0080>ù said the ex-Harvard economist Philippe Aghion, now at the Coll√®ge de France, and one of Mr. Macron‚<U+0080><U+0099>s principal economic advisers.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to stop being obsessed by the rich, and start being obsessed by poverty traps,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Aghion said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>President of the Rich‚<U+0080>ù is a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>thoroughly illegitimate charge against him,‚<U+0080>ù said Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a centrist deputy who is sympathetic to Mr. Macron, though not in his political movement.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s explained by the deep hostility of the French toward the rich,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Bourlanges said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As soon as something is seen as favoring the rich, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also seen as an attack on the poor.‚<U+0080>ùBut Mr. Bourlanges added that it was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>idiotic‚<U+0080>ù for Mr. Macron ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to present the suppression of the Solidarity Wealth Tax as the first thing you do. He should have said, we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll suppress it progressively.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Macron has now eliminated non-real-estate assets from the tax, cutting it by some $3.7 billion.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t this just a gift to the rich?‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Macron was asked during the lengthy television interview, in language that echoed the attacks in parliament.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Are you not the ‚<U+0080><U+0098>President of the Rich?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù he was asked. Mr. Macron bristled.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in this French jealousy which says, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>There are rich people; let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tax them and we will all feel better,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Macron said testily.He pointed to news reports showing that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the big French fortunes don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even pay the Solidarity Wealth Tax,‚<U+0080>ù because they simply leave the country. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>So this is classic French hypocrisy,‚<U+0080>ù he said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In order for our society to do better,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Macron argued, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got to have people who succeed, and people will then say, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s great.‚<U+0080>ùBut then he used a metaphor for the rich that left him open, again, to the elitist charge. He called them ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the first in the rope line.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Macron, while vowing that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the others who are fragile, we will protect them,‚<U+0080>ù added that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>if we throw stones at the first in the rope line, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the whole line that collapses.‚<U+0080>ùWhile Mr. Macron‚<U+0080><U+0099>s phrase was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>clumsy‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a bit arrogant,‚<U+0080>ù he was nonetheless on ‚<U+0080><U+009C>absolutely the right path‚<U+0080>ù in policy terms, said Mr. Bourlanges, the lawmaker.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Macron is like a test-tube baby,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He came out of school and then it was a succession of bubbles. He lacks the popular touch.‚<U+0080>ùOn a bustling corner of Brighton Beach Avenue in Brooklyn beams a sign of the times: Tashkent Supermarket.The cavernous store opened five months ago in this Russian enclave to serve the growing community from Uzbekistan. Over Halal meat, and a steaming buffet of plov and kebabs, recent and older immigrants alike shook their heads in disgust over the terrorist attack in Manhattan on Halloween.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even discuss what he did,‚<U+0080>ù Aziz Rashidov, 28, said in Uzbek, as he tended to the buffet last Friday. He added in Russian, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Something is not right in the head.‚<U+0080>ùThe ‚<U+0080><U+009C>he‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Rashidov was referring to was Sayfullo Saipov, the 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant who is accused of plowing into a crowd of people on a popular bike path in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday and killing eight people and injuring 12 in what the authorities called a deliberate act of terrorism.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a bad thing, really shameful,‚<U+0080>ù Dilorom Borozorva, 30, said in Uzbek. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>People now think differently about Uzbeks.‚<U+0080>ùFor the second time in three years, members of the Uzbek community in Brooklyn were talking about young immigrants-turned-extremists from their home country. In February 2015, Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, then 24, was arrested with two other Uzbek men and one from Kazakhstan in what the authorities say was a plot to join the Islamic State. (Two additional Uzbek men living in Brooklyn were later charged.)On Oct. 27, just four days before the truck attack, Mr. Juraboev was sentenced to 15 years in prison.Tuesday‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attack was the worst terrorist act in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, and it, again, threw unwanted attention on Uzbeks in New York, for whom a visa lottery has recently offered a ticket to residency.In 2000, there were 5,033 Uzbekistan-born residents in Brooklyn, according to the American Community Survey. By 2015, that number increased to 13,651, according to statistics compiled by Queens College. Of the 55,177 Uzbekistan-born immigrants in the United States, nearly half of them (25,657) reside in New York City.Mr. Saipov and his wife, Nozima Odilova, lived in Paterson, N.J., and his wife‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family has lived in South Brooklyn since 2009.From the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s seven-floor Brooklyn apartment building in Sheepshead Bay, where the aroma of cumin and sizzling vegetables wafted through the hallways last week, recent immigration trends can be traced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Five to six years ago, there were hardly any people of Uzbek origin in the building, and then there was a big influx of them. And they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re coming to this neighborhood in general,‚<U+0080>ù said Peter Valdes, 22, a resident in the building and the son of the longtime superintendent. He was also a porter in the building.At the apartment occupied by the family of Mr. Saipov‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, a young woman who identified herself only as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the sister‚<U+0080>ù answered the door the day after the attack wearing a hijab. Two toddlers played in the living room behind her.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I cannot tell you anything right now, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry,‚<U+0080>ù the woman said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s my future, also. I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be in bad news.‚<U+0080>ùA legal clinic at the City University of New York School of Law, Clear, which stands for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility, is representing Ms. Odilova. In 2015, Clear advised Muslim Uzbek residents from Brooklyn after they were contacted by the police in the 2015 case, and offered ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Know Your Rights‚<U+0080>ù clinics.Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at CUNY and the founder of Clear, declined to comment about his client.Few other Uzbek residents in the building said they knew the quiet, almost reclusive family. Nargiza Gapparova, 42, who came from Uzbekistan in 2013, said she saw the family occasionally in the building, but she did not know them. Working three jobs, and with three older children, she said she had no time to socialize.One of her daughters studies at the Borough of Manhattan Community College on Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan; Ms. Gapparova‚<U+0080><U+0099>s daughter had left the campus before the attack happened across the street.Ms. Gapparova arrived via the same diversity visa lottery that also allowed Mr. Saipov and Mr. Juraboev to enter the United States and become permanent residents. Under the program, 27,212 Uzbeks have been admitted across the country since 2007, according to the State Department.Last week, after the Manhattan attack, President Trump vowed to end the program, which was approved in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, and took effect in 1995 as a way to foster immigration from countries with previously low rates.At first, the program benefited immigrants from Europe and Africa, but increasingly, residents of countries from the former Soviet Union have found it an enticing ticket. In 2015, according to the State Department, 833,998 Uzbekistan residents applied, second only to Ukraine. But only a fraction ‚<U+0080><U+0094> 2,524 people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> from Uzbekistan came to the United States with the visa that year.The recent arrivals, many from the capital of Tashkent or Samarkand in the south, are moving to Brighton Beach, which is why Tashkent Supermarket opened there.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The customers are Uzbek, most of the workers are Uzbek, I kind of have a sense that we are living in Uzbekistan,‚<U+0080>ù said a manager, Shokrukh Achilov, 26, who said he arrived with a diversity visa from Uzbekistan.He is Muslim, but said he tends to pray at home. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is no such thing as killing people in Islam,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Achilov added.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have never heard about any extremist idea of Islam being preached here,‚<U+0080>ù said Gulnoza Said, a New York-based Uzbek journalist.She added that the accused attacker‚<U+0080><U+0099>s extremist views, apparently stirred by the internet, likely developed more out of loneliness and disaffection with his situation than because of his nationality. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What is important about Saipov is not that he was Uzbek,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Said said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but that he was an immigrant who didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t find his path in this country.‚<U+0080>ùSteven Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new movie, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Crown‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life with quick, grim strokes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ostensibly because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a suicide risk ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s who and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t belong in the hospital but doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help her case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Carrie‚<U+0080>ù) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Shining,‚<U+0080>ù another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich√©s and sadism and just read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crickets‚<U+0080>ù is slang for critics, but maybe the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.The inhabitants of the derelict mansion in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lodgers‚<U+0080>ù don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get out much. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s script, the director Brian O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins‚<U+0080><U+0099> birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a measure of this movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insistently fright-free storytelling that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Edward. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dracula,‚<U+0080>ù as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit.CREVE COEUR, Mo. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Anheuser-Busch heir William Busch has been cited with assault after intervening in an altercation between his son and a fellow sixth-grader at a basketball practice in suburban St. Louis, according to police.The 58-year-old Busch allegedly grabbed an 11-year-old student and pushed him into a wall in November at the gym at Chaminade College Preparatory School in Creve Coeur, police said in statement released Saturday. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that other adults separated Busch and the child after the incident. Police said the child told investigators he wasn't injured.Busch, the great-grandson of Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch, received a summons for fourth-degree assault, a municipal ordinance violation.His attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said Busch intervened after school personnel failed to react when his son was ""bullied ‚<U+0080><U+0094> actually sucker-punched ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by a much larger middle school student directly in front of him.""The father of the other boy said Busch's son was the initial aggressor and that school and basketball officials ""acted swiftly and decisively in calming the situation,"" including removing Busch and his son from the facility.His son told police the scuffle began when the younger Busch pushed him two or three times, then raised his arm and a closed fist, according to a police report. After the boy slapped the younger Busch, the elder Busch approached him ""from behind and began shouting profanities,"" according to the report. The boy said Busch grabbed his shirt collar, pushing him backward, and a scuffle ensued.A social worker contacted police after the incident, which was captured on the school's security cameras and anonymously reported to the Missouri School Violence Hotline.The elder Busch, who never worked for Anheuser-Busch, has had other scrapes with the law. In 1981, prosecutors declined to press charges after he allegedly bit off another man's earlobe during a late-night brawl outside a tavern. Busch, then 22, told police the other man started the fight.___Information from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.comDALLAS ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Seattle Seahawks released quarterback Trevone Boykin on Tuesday shortly after his girlfriend alleged in a television interview that he physically assaulted her in Texas last week.The practice squad player was released from the team after WFAA-TV in Dallas posted an interview with Boykin's girlfriend detailing an assault she alleges happened on March 20 in Mansfield, just southwest of Dallas. The woman said she refused to show Boykin a text message and an argument ensued, and that he broke her jaw and tried to strangle her.Boykin, 24, denied the allegations in a statement released Tuesday to NFL Media. He called the allegations false and said he wasn't involved in a physical fight.""This woman has lied about me and it has cost me my job,"" he wrote. ""I understand the Seahawks decision to release me. The story that was reported casts a bad light on the organization and on me.""Boykin's agent, Drew Pittman, also told WFAA that the allegations were false. A call to the agent's cellphone by The Associated Press went unanswered Tuesday.Mansfield police spokesman Sgt. Michael Midkiff said the department is investigating the alleged assault. He said no charges had been filed as of Tuesday and that the investigation was in a very early stage.The assault allegation is the latest off-field issue for Boykin, who has spent his NFL career with Seattle.He was arrested in Dallas last year when a vehicle he was a passenger in hit several people on a sidewalk. He fled the scene on foot but was later arrested on misdemeanor charges of public intoxication and possession of marijuana.In 2015, Boykin was arrested for assaulting a police officer and public intoxication shortly before the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio during his senior season at TCU. Boykin, who was the team's quarterback, was suspended for the bowl game.___Associated Press Sports Writer Tim Booth contributed to this report from Seattle.BOSTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A state senator's husband was indicted Thursday on charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos without consent and criminal lewdness.The indictment of Bryon Hefner, the husband of Democratic Sen. Stanley Rosenberg, came months after The Boston Globe reported on allegations that Hefner sexually harassed or abused several men, some of whom had business before the Legislature.Prosecutors said Hefner sexually assaulted three victims between 2014 and 2016. They said he also obtained nude and partially nude photos of another victim without that victim's knowledge and sent or showed the photos to other people.""Today's indictments on multiple felony charges send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,"" Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. ""I want to thank the victims who have come forward and put their trust in us.""Hefner's attorney said he ""intends to plead not guilty and looks forward to contesting the evidence and confronting the witnesses against him in a court of law.""Hefner is set to be arraigned on April 24 in Suffolk Superior Court, prosecutors said.Rosenberg, who is separated from Hefner, said these are ""serious charges.""""They are now being handled by the judicial system,"" he said in a statement. ""I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.""Rosenberg, who's in his late 60s, announced in January that he had separated from Hefner, who's 30, and that Hefner had entered treatment for alcohol dependency.Democratic state Senate President Harriette Chandler, who replaced Rosenberg as president, called the charges ""deeply disturbing.""""Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the District Attorney and Attorney General's Office,"" she said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, both Republicans, said they ""commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.""The initial reports that several men had accused Hefner of sexual assault or harassment sent the chamber into turmoil late last year, resulting in Rosenberg's decision to step down.The Senate Ethics Committee voted to hire a Boston law firm to independently investigate whether Rosenberg violated any Senate rules in connection with the allegations. That probe is ongoing.Rosenberg, a state senator since 1991, had initially hoped to return as president once the investigation was completed, but pressure mounted on senators to move on after the Globe subsequently reported that Hefner had involved himself in matters before the Senate. That included having access to Rosenberg's email account, despite Rosenberg's earlier promise to keep a ""firewall"" between his professional and personal lives.A lawyer for Hefner said at the time that Hefner ""did not have independent access to his husband's official email.""Rosenberg has repeatedly said that Hefner did not influence his actions and decisions as Senate president.Rosenberg assumed the top leadership post in January 2015. He was the first openly gay leader of either legislative chamber in Massachusetts.Democratic state Sen. Karen Spilka last week announced that she had secured commitments from enough of her colleagues to become the next Senate president, essentially ending any hope of Rosenberg's return as president. Rosenberg continues to serve as senator.When Chandler, who's 80, took over after Rosenberg's decision to step down, she said she intended to serve as president only through the remainder of this year.___Associated Press writers Bob Salsberg and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.OKLAHOMA CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed Wednesday that it is looking into a lawsuit's allegations that a middle school student was sexually assaulted and threatened by classmates over 18 months and that school officials did nothing to stop the attacks.The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Oklahoma City by the now 14-year-old boy and his parents, alleges that Superintendent A.J. Brewer and Principal Stuart McPherson of Washington Public Schools, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City treated the assaults as ""horseplay"" or ""accidental touching.""The OSBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations should be finished soon, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.""We should have our reports completed in a few weeks. We will then hand it over to the district attorney. The DA will then determine how to proceed,"" and whether criminal charges are warranted, Brown said.School attorney Andy Fugitt said Wednesday that he was aware of the lawsuit but that he could not comment on pending litigation.Under Oklahoma law, anyone who suspects a child under the age of 18 is being abused is required to report the suspicion to the state's Department of Human Services.According to the lawsuit, DHS was notified of the allegations in May 2017, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation began investigating in November at the request of the Washington Police Department.DHS spokeswoman Sheree Powell said the agency is prohibited by state and federal law from confirming any investigation.""We don't or confirm investigations involving particular allegations or individuals,"" Powell said.The lawsuit comes after four former football players in the Tulsa suburb of Bixby were previously charged with sexually assaulting a teammate that prosecutors said wasn't promptly reported.The four have pleaded not guilty and their attorneys have asked that the each be certified as juveniles.An Associated Press investigation published in 2017 examined sexual violence in school sports as part of a larger look at student-on-student sex assaults. The investigation found that team sexual assault is often mischaracterized as hazing and bullying and that the violence is so normalized that it persists for years, as players attacked one season become aggressors the next.MILWAUKEE ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The family of two sexual assault victims says a television ad that alludes to their case to attack a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate is hurtful and should be removed from the air.The TV spot airing across Wisconsin involves a 2011 case in which Milwaukee County Judge Rebecca Dallet sentenced the victims' attacker to two years in prison instead of giving him the maximum 20-year-sentence, according to the ad.A family member of the victims ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who were 13 and 8 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> told WTMJ-TV the ad uses enough detail from the case to reveal their identities.""It's shameful, it's hurtful and I just need these ads to be taken down,"" said the family member, who asked for anonymity from WTMJ-TV.The Associated Press and many news organizations typically do not identify sexual assault victims.The ad is paid for by the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce Issues Mobilization Council, which supports Dallet's opponent, Sauk County Judge Michael Screnock. His campaign is not responsible for the ad and is not affiliated with the group.The race is officially nonpartisan but Republicans and right-leaning groups such as business are generally supporting Screnock while Democrats and groups such as Planned Parenthood are backing Dallet. The election is Tuesday.The manufacturers group said in a statement that the public should know about Dallet's record and that the ad ""merely repeats publicly available information from public records and information that has already been reported on by several news organizations.""""In fact, the state's largest newspaper reported on Judge Dallet's light sentence in this case earlier this year,"" the statement said. The statement did not address whether the group would consider taking down the ad or how long it will be broadcast.The Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said in a statement that the ad ""disgracefully identifies the relationship of the offender to his victim."" The DA's office said they learned about the ad from the victims' family.Tuesday's election is nonpartisan on paper but Dallet is liberal and Screnock is conservative. The court is currently controlled 5-2 by conservatives.Dallet's campaign said they've had no contact with the victims' family.""It is heartbreaking to see the pain this family is experiencing because of this attack ad,"" Dallet said in a statement.Screnock spokesman Sean Lansing said in a statement that Screnock's sole campaign ad has been positive and that a group supporting Dallet has also run negative ads attacking Screnock's work as a judge on similar cases.""I would also note that as a sitting judge and a candidate for our state's highest court, it would be inappropriate for Judge Screnock to comment on the validity of third party issue ads since this is a topic that is regularly debated and litigated and could very well make its way to the high court,"" Langsing said.___This story has been corrected to reflect the correct spelling of Screnock spokesman Sean Lansing's last name.SYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Australia's rugby sevens captain James Stannard was ruled out of the Commonwealth Games with a fractured skull following a 'one-punch' attack in Sydney early on Friday after a farewell dinner for departing coach Andy Friend.New South Wales Police said in a statement that a 22-year-old man had been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a 35-year-old man had been punched in an alleged ""unprovoked"" attack.Rugby Australia (RA) later identified Stannard as the victim of the attack and said he was in hospital with a fractured skull.""He's not available for the Commonwealth Games and that's obviously a massive disappointment for all of us and James and his family,"" RA high performance manager Ben Whitaker told reporters in Sydney.""We know that right now he needs some time to heal ... and then once that's sorted, we'll look at how he can return to play.""RA said Stannard and a group of players and team management had been at a fast-food outlet following the dinner for Friend when the alleged attack occurred.Two players in the squad, including regular captain Lewis Holland, and Friend detained the man shortly afterwards and held him until police arrived, RA said.Friend was told earlier this month that his contract with the team would not be renewed in July, but RA said they hoped he would remain with the wider organisation.Australia's women's Olympic gold-medal winning coach Tim Walsh will replace Friend after next month's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.""We had an organised function to celebrate and recognise the role Andy Friend has played with the team,"" Whitaker added.""Family and friends, players, staff all gathered for dinner and went out afterwards.""They were all together and there was management involved the whole night, so it was a very civilised, organised event.""Stannard had replaced the injured Holland as captain for the tournament.The men's tournament will be held on the final two days of the April 4-15 Games, with Australia drawn in Pool B with Samoa, Jamaica and England.(Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford/Amlan Chakraborty)Some sexual encounters are obviously consensual, while others are obviously not. But what about those that are neither black nor white? In the second episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars plunge deeper into the gray area.A woman who calls herself ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stuck in the Gray‚<U+0080>ù is still haunted by her first sexual encounter over a decade later. At age 22, she lost her virginity to her brother-in-law, who is 11 years her senior. The encounter had lasting repercussions on her sex life and her relationship with her family, especially her sister, her brother-in-law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife. Stuck in the Gray struggled to define the encounter for years and now she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unable to conclude if it was consensual. She asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I a coward and a liar who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hiding my accountability behind victimization?

He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an enemy of the state, a man of God and the great hero of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Power and the Glory.‚<U+0080>ù Father Frank Docherty, the protagonist of Thomas Keneally‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new novel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crimes of the Father,‚<U+0080>ù is a bad priest to some and a good one to others, and he certainly knows it. Sent away from his native Sydney in 1972 by an archbishop who found Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s political activism and theological liberalism unacceptable, he is by the 1990s a psychologist and a professor in Canada. Under those auspices, he researches the sexual abuse of children and minors by the clergy. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He knew the suspicion he attracted from his brethren in the wider priesthood. He was a priest who ponced around academia all week, dealing with unhealthy and distasteful subjects, and helped out at a local parish on the weekend ‚<U+0080><U+0094> how graceful of him!‚<U+0080>ùFor his 36th novel, Keneally has chosen a subject that is by now painfully familiar to both Roman Catholics and the wider public. The main action takes place in Sydney in 1996 and concerns the city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s longstanding Irish population. This is a time and place and community in which those abused are just beginning to come forward more boldly, while church leaders and the faithful more broadly are themselves only just starting to reckon more openly with longstanding patterns of institutional failure, corruption and concealment. As he returns to Sydney to lecture on his research, resume complicated friendships and seek permission from the current archbishop to celebrate Mass again in his native archdiocese, Docherty becomes involved in an intertwined series of private and public revelations.For obvious reasons, Keneally admires his protagonist. As such, Docherty is not especially interesting, for he rarely seems genuinely unsure of himself. Whether he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preparing to confront an elite clergyman and his superior with evidence of the clergyman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s abuse or trying to deal with once strong, now reheated feelings for a married woman, his struggles come across as stylized, even romantically heroic. You can be damned sure, mate, that tough-and-tender ol‚<U+0080><U+0099> Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s going to do the difficult thing, and do it well, no matter the odds.The novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s far more distinctive and well-wrought character is Sarah Fagan, the Sydney cabdriver who picks up Docherty at the airport upon his return. Through intensely told flashback sequences, Keneally brings out the confusion and pain teenage Sarah experiences when she comes under the influence of Father Leo Shannon, a rising young star in the archdiocese. Under the guise of hiring her as his office assistant, Shannon makes Fagan feel privileged, even blessed, to spend secret time doing secret things with him. When he coolly rejects her for other girls, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>she felt the jolt of this news, and a sickening bewilderment in the pit of her stomach; the extreme sentiments of the rejected.‚<U+0080>ùFrom this brilliant, brutal rendering of Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s victimization, Keneally traces out her jagged trajectory through a convent childhood, university studies, a teaching career and assorted vocational and spiritual spinouts, and finally into her very tentative alliance with Docherty. This last happens to coincide with Docherty‚<U+0080><U+0099>s confrontation with Shannon himself, now a key adviser to the archbishop in legal proceedings concerning another abuse case. The heroism and villainy that play out thereafter is suspenseful, if predictable. Far more powerfully felt is Fagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unexpected expression of thanks to Docherty, near the novel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s end, for a favor he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s done her, which has made possible both personal renewal and public justice. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What favor is that?‚<U+0080>ù the priest asks. Her answer: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You believed me.‚<U+0080>ùJust one day after Hollywood offered a show of support for the #MeToo movement on the Golden Globes red carpet and stage, a famous actress on the other side of the Atlantic lent her name to a public letter denouncing the movement, as well as its French counterpart, #Balancetonporc, or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Expose Your Pig.‚<U+0080>ùCatherine Deneuve joined more than 100 other Frenchwomen in entertainment, publishing and academic fields Tuesday in the pages of the newspaper Le Monde and on its website in arguing that the two movements, in which women and men have used social media as a forum to describe sexual misconduct, have gone too far by publicly prosecuting private experiences and have created a totalitarian climate.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Rape is a crime. But insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression,‚<U+0080>ù the letter, dated Monday, begins. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As a result of the Weinstein affair, there has been a legitimate realization of the sexual violence women experience, particularly in the workplace, where some men abuse their power. It was necessary. But now this liberation of speech has been turned on its head.‚<U+0080>ùThey contend that the #MeToo movement has led to a campaign of public accusations that have placed undeserving people in the same category as sex offenders without giving them a chance to defend themselves. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This expedited justice already has its victims, men prevented from practicing their profession as punishment, forced to resign, etc., while the only thing they did wrong was touching a knee, trying to steal a kiss, or speaking about ‚<U+0080><U+0098>intimate‚<U+0080><U+0099> things at a work dinner, or sending messages with sexual connotations to a woman whose feelings were not mutual,‚<U+0080>ù they write. The letter, written in French was translated here by The New York Times.The passage appears to refer to the some of the names on a growing list of men who have been suspended, fired or forced to resign after having been accused of sexual misconduct in the last several months.One of the arguments the writers make is that instead of empowering women, the #MeToo and #BalanceTonPorc movements instead serve the interests of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the enemies of sexual freedom, of religious extremists, of the worst reactionaries,‚<U+0080>ù and of those who believe that women are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0098>separate‚<U+0080><U+0099> beings, children with the appearance of adults, demanding to be protected.‚<U+0080>ù They write that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a woman can, in the same day, lead a professional team and enjoy being the sexual object of a man, without being a ‚<U+0080><U+0098>promiscuous woman,‚<U+0080><U+0099> nor a vile accomplice of patriarchy.‚<U+0080>ùThey believe that the scope of the two movements represses sexual expression and freedom. After describing requests from publishers to make male characters ‚<U+0080><U+009C>less sexist‚<U+0080>ù and a Swedish bill that will require people to give explicit consent before engaging in sexual activity, the women write, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>One more effort and two adults who will want to sleep together will first check, through an app on their phone, a document in which the practices they accept and those they refuse will be duly listed.‚<U+0080>ùThey continue, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The philosopher Ruwen Ogien defended the freedom to offend as essential to artistic creation. In the same way, we defend a freedom to bother, indispensable to sexual freedom.‚<U+0080>ù Though the writers do not draw clear lines between what constitutes sexual misconduct and what does not, they say that they are ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sufficiently farseeing not to confuse a clumsy come-on and sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ùTranslations of the letter were quickly picked up by Twitter on Tuesday, and responses ranged from supportive to hostile. Asia Argento, an actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the Frenchwomen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter on Twitter.On the other side of the spectrum, Christina Hoff Sommers, who coined the term ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victim feminism,‚<U+0080>ù tweeted a quote from the letter and her remarks on it.In France, tens of thousands of stories have landed on social media under the hashtag #Balancetonporc since the journalist Sandra Muller used it in October in a post on Twitter about an inappropriate come-on she received from a French executive.The multitude of revelations in France has led to discussion of legislative proposals that would fine men for aggressive catcalling or lecherous behavior toward women in public, and lengthen the statute of limitations for cases involving minors. Marl√®ne Schiappa, France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s junior minister for gender equality, said that France‚<U+0080><U+0099>s parliament would also debate whether to establish a clear age below which a minor cannot consent to a sexual relationship. The decision came after French prosecutors declined to charge a 28-year-old man with rape after he had sex with an 11-year-old girl.In March, Ms. Deneuve defended Roman Polanski, the director who pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl and who was accused by two other women of forcing himself on them when they were under age. While appearing on a French television channel, Ms. Deneuve said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been dealt with, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a case that has been judged. There have been agreements between Roman Polanski and this woman.‚<U+0080>ùIn concluding the letter, the writers return to the concept of self-victimization and a call for women to accept the pitfalls that come with freedom. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Accidents that can affect a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s body do not necessarily affect her dignity and must not, as hard as they can be, necessarily make her a perpetual victim,‚<U+0080>ù they write. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Because we are not reducible to our bodies. Our inner freedom is inviolable. And this freedom that we cherish is not without risks and responsibilities.‚<U+0080>ùIf you were dream-casting the role of Golden Globes host for the season of #MeToo and #TimesUp, with black-clad attendees from TV series and films that confronted misogyny (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Handmaid‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Tale‚<U+0080>ù) and racism (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Get Out‚<U+0080>ù) and a barnburner of a speech by a black female icon, you might not have picked the straight white guy.Nor, apparently, would the straight white guy. From his opening line, Seth Meyers hung a light on the dissonance of a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s being the master of this ceremony: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.‚<U+0080>ù Hosts of future awards shows, he said, were ‚<U+0080><U+009C>watching me tonight like the first dog they shot into outer space.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers borrowed a bit from his late-night talk show, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jokes Seth Can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t Tell,‚<U+0080>ù in which Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel deliver comedy that would sound strange coming from him. Here, he set up a gag for stars including Jessica Chastain (‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Golden Globes turned 75 this year ‚<U+0080>¶ ‚<U+0080>ù), who sold the punch line (‚<U+0080><U+009C> ‚<U+0080>¶ but the actress that plays its wife is still only 32‚<U+0080>ù).Irony is Mr. Meyers‚<U+0080><U+0099>s thing, and he was deftly funny pointing it out. But the fact remains that the change in the air at the Globes is a recent and hardly complete process.On the one hand, the speeches from the podium were often sharply conscious ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not just the acceptances. Natalie Portman, presenting the best director award for film, announced, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Here are the all-male nominees.‚<U+0080>ùAnd Oprah Winfrey, accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, took the audience to church with a fervent, personal speech dedicated to abused women inside and outside Hollywood. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>But their time is up.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Meyers wisecracked in his monologue about the notion that Ms. Winfrey ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who has played down her political ambitions before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might run for president. By the end of her speech, it sounded a tiny bit less like a joke.Still, for all the consensus from the stage, the Globes still celebrated the power players of a system in which Harvey Weinstein, whose abuses precipitated the current moment, was active just a year ago. And at the awards, by and large, the men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> half of any gender dynamic in Hollywood or elsewhere ‚<U+0080><U+0094> let their ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up‚<U+0080>ù pins do the talking.Awards celebration has mingled with dissent before ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like at last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Globes, just before the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. (He still took a few digs this year.)It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something else for the usually frothy Globes to be held at a moment when the industry, or at least a portion of it, is dissenting against itself.The unsteady balance was apparent from the first footsteps on the red carpet. There were fewer questions about who the stars were wearing, and more about why. (Again, the women fielded a lot more of those questions than the men.)But there was dissonance, too, in an awards-media system not usually equipped to handle matters weightier than a champagne bubble. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Let me just tell you, our coverage is woke!‚<U+0080>ù said the E! correspondent Justin Sylvester, by way of introducing the 360-degree camera at the celebrity arrival area.When woke met woke, it was sometimes a rude awakening. On the E! red-carpet special, Debra Messing called out the network for its treatment of its former news host Catt Sadler, who said she left E! because of a gender pay gap. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in paying their female co-host the same as their male co-host,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Messing said.For much of the night, though, it was a surprisingly ordinary Golden Globes. It wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t quite a celebration; it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely a protest. (Even the black color scheme ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a visual statement for the women, less so for the ordinarily tux-clad men ‚<U+0080><U+0094> conveyed the feeling of a half-demonstration.) The Golden Globes always pitches itself as a televised party, but what kind?Maybe, as the color scheme suggested, the awards were meant to be a wake for a system of victimization. But it will be a good number of awards cycles, after the black outfits are put away, before we know if it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quite dead.Utah‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief law enforcement officer was deep in the fight against opioids when he realized that a lack of data on internet sales of fentanyl was hindering investigations. So the officer, Keith D. Squires, the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s public safety commissioner, created a team of analysts to track and chronicle online distribution patterns of the drug.In Philadelphia, hidebound ways of confronting iPhone thefts let thrive illicit networks to distribute stolen cellphones. Detectives treated each robbery as an unrelated street crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> known as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>apple picking‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> rather than a vast scheme with connected channels used by thieves to sell the stolen phones.And in Nashville, investigators had no meaningful statistics on a nasty new swindle of the digital age: the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheating husband‚<U+0080>ù email scheme. In it, anonymous extortionists mass-email large numbers of men, threatening to unmask their infidelities. The extortionists have no idea if the men have done anything wrong, but enough of them are guilty, it turns out, that some pay up, sometimes with Bitcoin.Each case demonstrates how the tools used to fight crime and measure crime trends in the United States are outdated. Even as certain kinds of crimes are declining, others are increasing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> yet because so many occur online and have no geographic borders, local police departments face new challenges not only fighting them, but also keeping track of them. Politicians often promote crime declines without acknowledging the rise of new cybercrimes.Detectives only learned of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cheating husband‚<U+0080>ù scheme from faithful spouses who were not victims. The crime did not fit into any existing category, and since the police had made no arrests, they had no statistics to feed to a national crime database in Washington that can prepare other jurisdictions for the scheme.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Suspects take advantage, knowing that ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Hey, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m basically committing crimes blindly,‚<U+0080><U+0099> without the fear of prosecution,‚<U+0080>ù said Capt. Jason M. Reinbold, commander of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department‚<U+0080><U+0099>s criminal investigations division. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t analyze something if I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have data.‚<U+0080>ùMany of the offenses are not even counted when major crimes around the nation are tallied. Among them: identity theft; sexual exploitation; ransomware attacks; fentanyl purchases over the dark web; human trafficking for sex or labor; revenge porn; credit card fraud; child exploitation; and gift or credit card schemes that gangs use to raise cash for their traditional operations or vendettas.In a sense, technology has created an extraordinary moment for industrious criminals, increasing profits without the risk of street violence. Digital villainy can be launched from faraway states, or countries, eliminating physical threats the police traditionally confront. Cyberperpetrators remain unknown. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, ask themselves: Who owns their crimes? Who must investigate them? What are the specific violations? Who are the victims? How can we prevent it?‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s incredibly challenging,‚<U+0080>ù the police chief in Tucson, Chris Magnus, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s such a lack of clarity.‚<U+0080>ùThe rise of the crimes flies in the face of the proclamations of politicians who declare crime an all but defeated societal ill.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You have to go back to the 1950s to see crime this low,‚<U+0080>ù Bill de Blasio, New York City‚<U+0080><U+0099>s second-term Democratic mayor, said recently on MSNBC‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Morning Joe.‚<U+0080>ù His comments reflected last year‚<U+0080><U+0099>s historically low numbers of murders and shootings, burglaries, robberies and auto thefts ‚<U+0080><U+0094> offenses measured by the police CompStat tracking program.But to many criminologists, academics and law enforcement leaders, crimes like car theft are anachronisms in a modern era in which the internet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s virtual superhighways have supplanted brick-and-mortar streets as the scenes for muggings, prostitution rings or commercial burglaries. They see dips in traditional violence and larceny as offset by a twin phenomenon: A surge in the evolving crimes of the digital era, and the fact that they are not fully captured in law enforcement‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reporting systems.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the old iceberg metaphor,‚<U+0080>ù said Nola Joyce, a former deputy commissioner of Philadelphia‚<U+0080><U+0099>s police department. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>What we know about is above the surface. But in terms of value, and in terms of harm, a lot of that crime is below the surface.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an old saying that came out of the Vietnam War,‚<U+0080>ù she added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that said, `If you can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t measure what matters, what you measure matters a great deal.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Joyce is working with others on a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, to modernize local and federal crime-classification systems.New solutions are a priority, too, for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and progressive police commanders. They say that without timely, accurate data on crime, criminal justice leaders cannot see and respond coherently to national trends or make informed policy and spending decisions or tailor deployment strategies to best battle them.As Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group that has studied the issue, put it: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The problem is, to use an overused expression, `You don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know,‚<U+0080><U+0099> and by that I mean we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know the extent of these incidents in our communities or from a national perspective.‚<U+0080>ùIndeed, an Internet Crime Complaint Center established by the F.B.I. in 2000, to capture internet crime, received 298,728 complaints in 2016, reflecting $1.3 billion in combined losses, according to a new report by Mr. Wexler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group. But Donna Gregory, the head of the center, said that number of complaints only represented about 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims in the United States in 2016, and a fraction of all victims worldwide. In fact, a single category of internet crime ‚<U+0080><U+0094> identify theft ‚<U+0080><U+0094> generated $15.4 billion in losses in 2014, according to a crime victimization survey by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.In its report, Mr. Wexler‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group said its findings represented a wake-up call for the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 18,000 policing agencies facing an increase in technology-based crimes, that sprawl across jurisdictions, and recommended they fight back with similar tools by: developing their own digital expertise; hiring civilian analysts; mining technology, to help solve crime; encouraging banks to forward reports of theft rather write off their losses.Above all, policing needs ‚<U+0080><U+009C>better systems for gathering data,‚<U+0080>ù the report said.It is an issue that dates back to 1929, when the F.B.I. first rolled out its Uniform Crime Reporting system that still stands today. Designed as a summary count, it mainly tracks a handful of so-called Part One index crimes: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, arson and auto theft. The counts include only the top charge in a given episode.In the 1980s, the F.B.I., with Bureau of Justice Statistics, tried to improve the reporting by building the so-called National Incident-Based Reporting System to capture deeper levels of data across more categories. It created, for instance, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>crimes against a person‚<U+0080>ù which includes: assault, murder, kidnapping, abduction and sexual offenses. Each act is counted separately, within an incident or a crime that encompasses several criminal elements.But 40 years later, data collection is still haphazard as policing agencies that protect just 31 percent of the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s population volunteer to abide by the deeper reporting standards. (An example: There is no national database of police officers‚<U+0080><U+0099> use of deadly physical force.) Still, the F.B.I. is charging forward, vowing to move fully to its 1980s-era vision by 2021. Only last year did it began collecting data on two new offenses in its fraud category: hacking/computer invasion and identify theft.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crime data reporting ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in its current state ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is not collecting the right information to understand and analyze current events,‚<U+0080>ù Stephen G. Fischer Jr., an F.B.I. spokesman, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s information age has changed how we see the world and what the world expects from policing.‚<U+0080>ùThe panel of the National Academy of Sciences is looking past the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unmet goals ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which it sees as one component of a new approach. The panel wants a fresh system for understanding the nature and extent of crime today, said Janet L. Lauritsen, the panel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chair and a criminology professor at the University of Missouri.It envisions a format modeled in part, on an international framework organized by the United Nations that would reflect 11 prime categories of crime and 189 sublevels, including many that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>are just not even part of the national conversation on crime,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Lauritsen said. It would, for instance, capture reports from federal agencies, she said, that have never reported crime data to the F.B.I., ‚<U+0080><U+009C>even though there is actually a law on the books,‚<U+0080>ù the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act, from 1988, that compels it.Better data fosters transparency, which can build trust with civilians even if it yields statistical crime increases, said Col. Edwin C. Roessler Jr., the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., who is the F.B.I. director‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chairman for converting policing to a new crime classification system. Data offers the evidence to lobby government for more money or better laws, he said. In fact, when Colonel Roessler demonstrated how each gang homicide, on average, required 25 search warrants for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberdata, cellphones and other social media,‚<U+0080>ù it helped win financing for a new Cyber Bureau and new ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cyberexperts‚<U+0080>ù to work gang cases and build meaningful statistics and intelligence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>We‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve got gaps here, where we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not catching the root causes of all kinds of criminal activity,‚<U+0080>ù the colonel said, a flaw with real-life consequences.So too, for Chief Magnus, in Tucson, who sees the lack of modern-day crime classification as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>one of our biggest frustrations.‚<U+0080>ù As he leads a force of 850 officers patrolling 300 square miles, lapses in accurate statistics on property crime, fraud, human trafficking and digital crime hurt his ability to deploy thin resources.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Once you get into cyberspace,‚<U+0080>ù he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>data about anything is so limited that it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really, really hard to figure out even what might be happening locally that impacts that crime.‚<U+0080>ùENGLEWOOD, N.J. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Rapper Fabolous is facing domestic violence charges in New Jersey.Englewood police say the rapper, whose real name is John Jackson, turned himself in around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday. They say the alleged incident occurred earlier that day, but they would not identify the victim or say who reported it.Fabolous was charged with aggravated assault and making terroristic threats. He was released Wednesday night.The rapper lives in Englewood with his girlfriend, Emily B, a former cast member on the ""Love & Hip Hop: New York"" reality show.Fabolous' agent did not respond Thursday to a message seeking comment on the charges.Snapchat users noticed an ad that asked whether they would rather ‚<U+0080><U+009C>slap Rihanna‚<U+0080>ù or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>punch Chris Brown.‚<U+0080>ù On Thursday, the pop star took to Instagram, a direct competitor for Snapchat, to criticize the ad for making light of domestic violence. Stock prices for Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, sank by 4 percent.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d love to call it ignorance but I know you ain‚<U+0080><U+0099>t that dumb!‚<U+0080>ù Rihanna wrote in a statement, posted to her Instagram Stories. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it!!! This isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t about my personal feelings, cause I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have much of them‚<U+0080>¶but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven‚<U+0080><U+0099>t made it out yet ‚<U+0080>¶.you let us down! Shame on you.‚<U+0080>ùIn 2009, Mr. Brown was charged in a brutal beating after he hit, choked and bit Rihanna, and tried to push her out of the car. He eventually pleaded guilty to felony assault and received five years of probation.‚<U+0080><U+009C>This advertisement is disgusting and never should have appeared on our service,‚<U+0080>ù a spokesperson for Snapchat said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We are so sorry we made the terrible mistake of allowing it through our review process. We are investigating how that happened so that we can make sure it never happens again.‚<U+0080>ùThe ad was for a game called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Would You Rather?!,‚<U+0080>ù which was created last year by Daniel Lulic, a developer who previously designed two mobile ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Truth or Dare‚<U+0080>ù games. In Apple‚<U+0080><U+0099>s App Store, several reviewers criticized ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Would You Rather?!‚<U+0080>ù for posing questions about rape. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am very disturbed with one of the would you rather questions,‚<U+0080>ù wrote one user. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s under humor and it says Would you rather: Get raped by a llama or Rape a llama. No! Rape is NOT a joke!‚<U+0080>ùThe advertiser has now been blocked from Snapchat, according to the company.In February, Snapchat opened its advertising platform so third-parties can build software to buy ads, further automating the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advertising system. In its guidelines, Snapchat says that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all ads are subject to our review and approval.‚<U+0080>ù The official policy prohibits an array of content including anything that is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>shocking, sensational or disrespectful.‚<U+0080>ùThis most recent debacle sent the stock price of Snap Inc., which owns Snapchat, down more than 4 percent. The price jumped last month after an earnings report that exceeded expectations for the fourth quarter of 2017. Snapchat has been struggling since it went public last March, reporting dismal financial results last year for three consecutive quarters. Last week, Snap Inc. announced that it will be cutting 120 engineers.The company relies on a patina of cool to keep its young user base engaged, even as other mobile apps with similar or competing features have risen in popularity. Influencers play a large role in Snapchat‚<U+0080><U+0099>s branding, and the stock fluctuates based on their behavior. Last month, Kylie Jenner, who has marketed her cosmetics line on the platform and is one of its most popular users, tweeted, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me ‚<U+0080>¶ ugh this is so sad.‚<U+0080>ù Her comment has been liked more than 377,000 times. The day of her tweet, the company‚<U+0080><U+0099>s stock dropped 7 percent.The problematic ad points to a larger issue for social media companies: advertising that receives little to no editorial oversight. This is a central challenge for social media companies, and the reason racist content can flourish on the platforms, and how Russian agents could buy advertising on Facebook and Twitter in attempts to sway the 2016 election. Last September, ProPublica found that advertisers on Facebook could directly target content at users who were interested in topics like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jew hater,‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How to burn jews,‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>History of ‚<U+0080><U+0098>why jews ruin the world.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThird-party content caused a problem for Snapchat last week as well. Snapchat ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and Instagram ‚<U+0080><U+0094> had to halt its Giphy integration after a racist image showed up for its users. Giphy indexes most-popular GIFs and has used automated filters to screen for disturbing content. Now, the company has announced it will have human moderators screen every GIF.WASHINGTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094> One week after Rob Porter, his staff secretary, resigned amid spousal abuse allegations, President Trump said on Wednesday that he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>totally opposed to domestic violence,‚<U+0080>ù his first condemnation of the alleged conduct behind a scandal that has engulfed the White House.His statement, which members of both parties had said was long overdue, came as John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief of staff, faced new questions about his handling of Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, including how he could have held a temporary high-level security clearance for more than a year in light of the allegations, and as committees in both the House and the Senate announced they would investigate the circumstances surrounding the granting of Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clearance.Mr. Kelly told senior aides last fall to put an immediate end to granting new interim security clearances like the one given to Mr. Porter and directed them to resolve any issues preventing employees who held them at the time from receiving a full clearance, according to two people familiar with the discussion.At a meeting in the West Wing, Mr. Kelly said he was assigning Kirstjen Nielsen, then his deputy, to enforce the new policy, the people said. But it is not known whether Mr. Kelly, Ms. Nielsen or any other senior officials sought to delve into why Mr. Porter was operating with only an interim clearance.Mr. Porter resigned last week after allegations that he had abused his two former wives were reported by The Daily Mail. In the following days, Mr. Trump repeatedly declined to comment publicly on the episode ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or on the issue of domestic violence ‚<U+0080><U+0094> even as he went out of his way to praise Mr. Porter and express sympathy with him, noting that he had denied the accusations.But during a tax event on Wednesday at the White House, the president finally weighed in, saying: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind. Everyone knows that, and it almost wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t even have to be said.‚<U+0080>ùThe F.B.I. learned about the allegations by the two women soon after Mr. Trump was inaugurated last year. But spokesmen and spokeswomen for the White House have insisted that no senior White House officials knew of them until last week. They have said that the career government employees at the White House Personnel Security Office who processed the clearances did not tell them about the allegations uncovered by the F.B.I.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I am interested in how someone with credible allegations of domestic abuse, plural, can be hired,‚<U+0080>ù said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which will look into Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clearance and the granting of interim clearances generally. He called domestic abuse ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a particularly insidious crime‚<U+0080>ù that bears serious consideration in both the hiring and clearance process.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said that he had instructed his staff to also begin looking into the clearance process and into whether the proper protocols were followed at the White House, while six Democratic senators said that they were concerned about whether there had been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>any mishandling of classified information‚<U+0080>ù because of the interim clearances.The six senators asked Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, for the names of other employees at the White House who were working ‚<U+0080><U+009C>without being able to obtain a permanent security clearance.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Porter was allowed to continue serving in his post with an interim clearance while awaiting approval from the Personnel Security Office for a permanent clearance. The little-known office of about a dozen employees, on the fifth floor of the New Executive Office Building down the block from the White House, receives background information from the F.B.I. and determines whether officials should be cleared to have access to sensitive information.Mr. Wray testified on Tuesday that the F.B.I. had sent the White House a preliminary background report on Mr. Porter in March, a full investigation in July and a more detailed accounting in November. The agency closed its inquiry in January.But White House officials say the security office, where only one out of three officials who had to sign off on granting Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clearance had weighed in, never made a final recommendation.When senior White House aides have been flagged for concern during prior administrations, that information was typically sent to the general counsel at the Office of Administration, which oversees the security office, who would quickly pass the information to the White House counsel or the deputy chief of staff, according to people familiar with the process.Several former White House officials and people familiar with the security clearance process argue that it is highly unusual and dangerous for people at Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s level to do their jobs indefinitely without the proper clearance.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The presumption is not that you get clearance; the presumption is actually that you do not get clearance, and you have to prove yourself worthy of having access to vital information,‚<U+0080>ù said Max Stier, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that specializes in federal government management issues.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Interim clearance is simply to allow people to operate for a short time in their jobs while they await a full check, but if you get red flags in that interim clearance process, then it means that you shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have that interim clearance,‚<U+0080>ù he added.Even as Mr. Kelly‚<U+0080><U+0099>s past efforts to deal with security clearance issues at the White House were becoming clearer, his shifting public responses to the revelations of Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s past were coming under further scrutiny.Three people briefed on the situation said that Mr. Kelly learned that the accusations would be published in The Mail last Tuesday, before leaving for a visit to Capitol Hill. In a meeting with a group of aides, including several from the press office, everyone agreed that Mr. Porter would have to resign, the people briefed on the situation said, and a statement from Mr. Kelly was drafted to provide to The Mail.But Mr. Porter continued to deny the accusations from his former wives. One aide in the discussions pushed back on the belief that Mr. Porter should resign, saying that these were mere allegations, and that if Mr. Porter were forced out over them, other people could be forced from their posts any time an allegation was made. Other aides agreed, and argued for waiting for the story to play out.At that point, they reached out to Mr. Kelly, who had left for the visit to the Capitol, by phone, the people said, and he said he agreed, telling them to make his statement about Mr. Porter more supportive. Mr. Kelly dictated specific language that he wanted in the statement to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.A short time later, The Mail published Mr. Kelly‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statement calling Mr. Porter ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a man of true integrity and honor,‚<U+0080>ù someone with whom he was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>proud to serve,‚<U+0080>ù and who had faced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vile‚<U+0080>ù accusations from his former wives.But soon after the article appeared, Mr. Kelly, who by then had returned to the White House, heard from someone with more detailed knowledge of the allegations against Mr. Porter that more damning information was about to come out, and that the chief of staff should not put himself in the position of being Mr. Porter‚<U+0080><U+0099>s main defender. The people briefed on the discussions would not identify that person.The conversation prompted Mr. Kelly to go back to Mr. Porter, this time telling him that he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>knows what he has to do,‚<U+0080>ù according to those briefed on the discussion.Mr. Porter agreed to resign, and told his staff that he was stepping down, a White House official said. But the next morning, Wednesday of last week, he told White House aides he wanted to leave on his own terms and help with the transition. Mr. Kelly told him that he had to leave his job, but he agreed to let Mr. Porter attempt a more graceful exit with an unclear departure date, those briefed said.The scandal has placed Mr. Kelly‚<U+0080><U+0099>s job in jeopardy, leading Mr. Trump to complain privately about him and sound out confidants about potential replacements, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of his National Economic Council, and Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader.Mr. Trump is said to seem more favorable toward Mr. McCarthy in some of his discussions, seeing him as someone who would be a more willing subordinate than Mr. Cohn might be, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. Yet in other conversations, Mr. Trump has indicated that Mr. Cohn is his pick.Several of Mr. Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advisers believe the president, who has a long history of quizzing aides about one another behind their backs without taking action, might just be venting. And his interactions with Mr. Kelly have remained mostly positive, according to two West Wing advisers who have witnessed them together.Still, Mr. Kelly is facing a restive staff that includes some aides who have grown increasingly upset with his handling of the Porter situation, including a constantly shifting set of explanations and timelines that have raised further questions about the White House‚<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility.As new information about the scandal emerged Wednesday, officials twice postponed, then ultimately canceled, the daily briefing by the press secretary. Press aides told reporters the question-and-answer session had been scrapped in light of a fatal school shooting in South Florida.The free-agent catcher Derek Norris was suspended Friday for the rest of the season for violating Major League Baseball‚<U+0080><U+0099>s domestic violence policy.Norris was released by the Tampa Bay Rays in late June, several weeks after his former fianc√©e Kristen Eck wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post that Norris verbally and physically abused her in 2015.Norris, who cooperated with M.L.B. investigators, as he is required to do, denied the accusations in a statement released by M.L.B. But he is not appealing his suspension and will forfeit the remaining $100,000 that is owed to him by the Rays, who will donate it to charities that treat victims of domestic violence.Norris, 28, is the fifth major league player to be disciplined under baseball‚<U+0080><U+0099>s domestic violence policy, which was instituted two years after negotiations with the players‚<U+0080><U+0099> union. A former All-Star, Norris was the first player to be disciplined after claims came to light on social media, as opposed to through the police.M.L.B. is currently investigating another such case involving Chicago Cubs shortstop Addison Russell. After Russell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, Melisa, wrote on Instagram that Russell had cheated on her, a friend of Melisa Russell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s posted that Addison Russell had hit his wife in front of his two young children. Addison Russell, who is in the midst of a divorce from his wife, has denied the accusation.When Major League Baseball began two domestic-violence investigations last month, allegations against Chicago Cubs shortstop Addison Russell and Tampa Bay Rays catcher Derek Norris did not come from the usual source ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a police report, or video, or court testimony.Instead, they came from social media.Kristen Eck, Norris‚<U+0080><U+0099>s former fianc√©e, wrote on Instagram that she had been physically and verbally abused by Norris in 2015. And after Russell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife, Melisa, wrote on Instagram that Russell had cheated on her, a friend of Melisa Russell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s posted that Addison Russell had hit his wife in front of his two young children.Norris, who has since been waived by the Rays, and Russell have denied accusations of abuse. Pat Courtney, an M.L.B. spokesman, confirmed that the league was investigating both cases but declined to say more.Though the two cases are in their early stages, they highlight a new challenge that baseball faces in addressing domestic violence.When Major League Baseball and the players‚<U+0080><U+0099> union jointly developed a policy on the issue nearly two years ago, it was intended to avoid missteps that had plagued other sports, particularly the N.F.L., when it came to investigating instances of domestic violence and meting out punishment.But little consideration was given to the role that social media ‚<U+0080><U+0094> rather than law enforcement ‚<U+0080><U+0094> might play in bringing potential domestic violence cases to light, according to a person in baseball familiar with the drafting of the agreement who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.The first five cases Major League Baseball investigated under its new policy had evidence that had already been generated by law enforcement or video. In the cases of Norris and Russell, there was none.This means baseball‚<U+0080><U+0099>s investigators must discern whether the allegations on social media are credible. And though players, under the terms of the new policy, are required to cooperate with those investigators, they may be wary of saying anything that could prompt an investigation by the police.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Individual players should be cautious,‚<U+0080>ù said Sharlene Boltz, a professor at the Chase College of Law at the Northern Kentucky University. Though the players may have an interest in cooperating, their personal counsel or a union representative ‚<U+0080><U+009C>has to be thinking, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Will this be used against me? Is it discoverable?‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùNorris told The Tampa Bay Times that he planned to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>go above and beyond to assist M.L.B. with their investigation.‚<U+0080>ùEck, who did not respond to an email request for an interview, has been cooperating with baseball investigators, but the women involved in Russell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case have not, according to a person familiar with the case who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. Thomas Field, an attorney for Melisa Russell, who has subsequently filed for divorce, said she would not meet with baseball investigators ‚<U+0080><U+009C>at this time.‚<U+0080>ùHe added that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the reason for not now is she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s in the best interest of her son and her family.‚<U+0080>ùM.L.B. investigators have also asked to meet with Melisa Russell‚<U+0080><U+0099>s friend, who made the accusation that Addison Russell had hit his wife, but she has not responded to emails or phone calls.The cases involving Russell and Norris somewhat mirror those involving the N.F.L. players Ezekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys and Jamison Crowder of the Washington Redskins, in which women posted photos on social media showing injuries they said were caused by the players.In Elliott‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, it led to the disclosure of a previous police report. But neither player was disciplined by the N.F.L.That women have turned to social media to make these statements is a sign that younger people view the medium as a community, and it also underscores the primary objective of abuse victims, according to those who have studied domestic violence.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not looking for revenge, they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re looking for an end to the abuse,‚<U+0080>ù said Kim Gandy, the chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot of conversations about what are the alternatives for victims who are not looking to have their husband or boyfriend go to jail for five years.‚<U+0080>ùBy turning to social media, she added, victims may also be hoping that pressure from peers, or even employers, will stop the abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You take your chances that if you have a few hundred friends on social media, that at least some of them will pipe up,‚<U+0080>ù Gandy said.But the world of sports is vastly larger. Sharing on social media not only makes a case very public, but it also enables fans who adore their athletic idols to harass those making the accusations, said Margaret Duval, the executive director of the Domestic Violence Legal Clinic.Still, Duval said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the good side of the double-edged sword is there are people who reach out in support, resources can be offered, and there can be a sense of liberation in not holding on to a secret.‚<U+0080>ùIn her post on Instagram, which has since been deleted, Russell wrote: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Being able to make your own choices for your own happiness beats being cheated on, lied to, & disrespected any day. #herestonewbeginnings #onlygetsbetterfromhere‚<U+0080>ùIn a lengthy post on her blog, which detailed the episode of which she had accused Norris of abuse, Eck wrote, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I hope multiple women can read this and get out of controlling situations, abusive situations and mentally and physically draining situations.‚<U+0080>ùBoltz, the law professor, said public expressions like these on a subject that can be personal and stigmatizing are rare among older people.‚<U+0080><U+009C>For my parent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s generation, or even my generation, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hesitancy in what we let out,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For myself, as a professor of millennials, they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re a little more relaxed in what they let out. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a generational thing: How this present social media plays into decision making, how do I express myself, how do I solve my problems?‚<U+0080>ùFor Major League Baseball, it is no different, making a sometimes complicated and delicate issue even more so.Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, the N.F.L.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s leading rusher as a rookie last season, has been suspended for six games without pay for violating the league‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal conduct policy.The N.F.L., after a yearlong investigations, reached its decision after reviewing Elliott‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior during a six-day stretch in July 2016 in which his ex-girlfriend Tiffany Thompson accused him of assaulting her five times in Columbus, Ohio, where he played at Ohio State. Elliott was not arrested or charged because prosecutors concluded that Thompson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s statements conflicted with those made by Elliott and witnesses. But he remained subject to discipline by the league.The N.F.L.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter to Elliott also cited an incident during a St. Patrick‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Day parade in March, when Elliott pulled down a woman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s shirt and exposed her breast, as reflecting ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a lack of respect for women‚<U+0080>ù and suggesting a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pattern of poor judgment and behavior.‚<U+0080>ùHe can appeal within three days. If he does not appeal, his suspension will begin Sept. 2. If he serves the full six games, he can return to the Cowboys on Oct. 23.The suspension raises the prospect of the league yet again beginning its season without a star player because of disciplinary action. Last year, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, served a four-game suspension over his role in the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Deflategate‚<U+0080>ù affair in which footballs were tampered with during a playoff game in 2016.This time, one of the league‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most powerful owners, Jerry Jones of the Cowboys, could end up in a showdown with the league‚<U+0080><U+0099>s commissioner, Roger Goodell.Jones has repeatedly defended Elliott, 22, recently saying that his review of the situation suggested ‚<U+0080><U+009C>not one thing ‚<U+0080><U+0094> that had anything to do with domestic violence.‚<U+0080>ùBut according to an N.F.L. statement, Todd Jones, the league‚<U+0080><U+0099>s special counsel for conduct, informed Elliott in a letter that the league‚<U+0080><U+0099>s group of advisers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>were of the view that there is substantial and persuasive evidence supporting a finding that [Elliott] engaged in physical violence against Ms. Thompson on multiple occasions during the week of July 16, 2016.‚<U+0080>ùGoodell consulted four advisers on the case: Peter Harvey, the former attorney general of New Jersey; Ken Houston, a Pro Football Hall of Famer; Tonya Lovelace, the chief executive of the Women of Color Network; and Mary Jo White, a former United States attorney and chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.The league said it interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, including Thompson and Elliott, as part of its investigation, and examined photographic evidence and thousands of text messages and other electronic communications.Elliott‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers, Frank Salzano and Scott Rosenblum, released a statement through Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, saying ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the N.F.L.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s findings are replete with factual inaccuracies and erroneous conclusions.‚<U+0080>ùThey added, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>During the upcoming weeks and through the appeal a slew of additional credible and controverting evidence will come to light.‚<U+0080>ùHarvey told reporters on a conference call that the NFL had access to forensic electronic evidence that prosecutors did not have, according to The Associated Press.Some of the explanations suggested by Elliott‚<U+0080><U+0099>s representatives, he said, including the possibility that Thompson was injured in a fight with a woman or by falling down stairs, were unsubstantiated.‚<U+0080><U+009C>There is no dispute that you and Ms. Thompson were together in the same location on the dates identified, and no evidence to suggest that anyone else could have caused these injuries,‚<U+0080>ù the letter said.The N.F.L. absorbed withering criticism for its handling of a domestic violence incident in 2014 involving the former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who initially received a two-game suspension after he was charged with assaulting his fianc√©e, who is now his wife. Only after video surfaced of the incident, in which Rice knocked out his fianc√©e in the elevator of an Atlantic City casino, did the N.F.L. suspend him indefinitely.Admitting that he had mismanaged the case, Goodell overhauled the league‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal conduct policy, introducing harsher guidelines for players and league employees involved in domestic violence cases by mandating six-game suspensions instead of two for first-time offenders.That rule has since been applied inconsistently. Jets receiver Quincy Enunwa had a suspension reduced to four games in October 2015 because he cooperated throughout the process. By contrast, the former Giants kicker Josh Brown, who wrote about being ‚<U+0080><U+009C>physically, verbally and emotionally‚<U+0080>ù abusive to his wife, was suspended for  one game.The Cowboys clearly prepared for their leading rusher‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pending absence, maintaining one of the deepest stables of running backs in the N.F.L. despite having a workhorse in Elliott.Elliott‚<U+0080><U+0099>s carries will be spread among Darren McFadden, Alfred Morris, Ronnie Hillman and Jahad Thomas. Hillman, who spent four years with the Denver Broncos before splitting last season between the Minnesota Vikings and San Diego Chargers, was added in July, generating speculation that he was brought in to help fill in for Elliott should a suspension occur.At the time of the signing, the Cowboys coach, Jason Garrett, denied that the team‚<U+0080><U+0099>s interest in Hillman had anything to do with Elliott, saying a hamstring injury to Thomas at the beginning of training camp inspired the move.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It really has everything to do with Jahad‚<U+0080><U+0099>s situation,‚<U+0080>ù Garrett told reporters.Still, the biggest question for the Cowboys as far as on-field production is concerned, is how the quarterback Dak Prescott will handle the start of his sophomore season without Elliott, who he came to rely on not just as a runner but as a tremendous decoy in the team‚<U+0080><U+0099>s play-action passing attack.FORTALEZA, Brasil ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Gritos de crian√ßas soavam na manh√£ quente e √∫mida, enquanto uma mulher empurrava um carrinho branco e reluzente pelas ruas esburacadas e repletas de lixo espalhado. Ela fazia entregas em algumas das casas mais pobres desta cidade litor√¢nea, levando sobremesas l√°cteas, biscoitos e outros alimentos industrializados aos clientes situados em seu trajeto.Celene da Silva, 29, √© uma de milhares de revendedoras porta a porta da Nestl√© que ajudam o maior conglomerado de alimentos industrializados do mundo a expandir seu alcance para 250 mil casas nos recantos mais long√≠nquos do pa√≠s.Enquanto entregava v√°rias embalagens da sobremesa l√°ctea Chandelle, de Kit-Kats e do cereal infantil Mucilon, algo chamava a aten√ß√£o sobre seus clientes: muitos estavam visivelmente acima do peso, incluindo as crian√ßas pequenas.Ela apontou para uma casa e sacudiu a cabe√ßa ao lembrar o modo como o chefe da fam√≠lia, um homem com obesidade grave, morreu na semana anterior: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ele comeu um peda√ßo de bolo e morreu enquanto dormia‚<U+0080>ù, recordou.Da Silva, ela mesma com quase 100 quilos, descobriu recentemente que tem hipertens√£o, um problema que reconhece estar relacionado ao seu fraco por frango frito e pela Coca-Cola que toma em todas as refei√ß√µes, incluindo o caf√© da manh√£.O ex√©rcito de vendas diretas da Nestl√© faz parte de uma mudan√ßa mais ampla na estrat√©gia das ind√∫strias aliment√≠cias, que inclui a entrega de junk food e bebidas a√ßucaradas consumidas no Ocidente at√© os rinc√µes mais isolados da Am√©rica Latina, √Åfrica e √Åsia. Enquanto suas vendas caem nos pa√≠ses mais ricos, as multinacionais do g√™nero aliment√≠cio, como Nestl√©, PepsiCo e General Mills, aumentam sua presen√ßa de forma acintosa nos pa√≠ses em desenvolvimento, comercializando seus produtos t√£o ostensivamente que chegam a transtornar os h√°bitos alimentares tradicionais do Brasil, Gana e √çndia.O New York Times analisou os registros de empresas, estudos epidemiol√≥gicos e relat√≥rios governamentais, assim como realizou entrevistas com v√°rios nutricionistas e especialistas em sa√∫de do mundo todo que revelam uma mudan√ßa radical na maneira como os alimentos s√£o produzidos, distribu√≠dos e anunciados em grande parte do mundo. Isso, segundo especialistas em sa√∫de p√∫blica, est√° contribuindo para uma nova epidemia de diabetes e problemas card√≠acos; doen√ßas cr√¥nicas associadas √†s elevadas taxas de obesidade de regi√µes que h√° apenas uma d√©cada lutavam para combater a fome e a desnutri√ß√£o.A nova realidade pode ser compreendida com um √∫nico e incontest√°vel fato: no mundo todo, o n√∫mero de obesos superou o de indiv√≠duos com baixo peso. Simultaneamente, a disponibilidade crescente de alimentos altamente cal√≥ricos e pobres em nutrientes est√° gerando um novo tipo de desnutri√ß√£o, caracterizada por um n√∫mero cada vez maior de pessoas com sobrepeso que, ao mesmo tempo, tem uma nutri√ß√£o prec√°ria.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A hist√≥ria vigente √© que este √© o melhor dos mundos poss√≠veis: alimentos baratos e amplamente dispon√≠veis. Se voc√™ n√£o analisa a quest√£o a fundo, faz sentido‚<U+0080>ù, afirmou Anthony Winson, que estuda pol√≠tica econ√¥mica de nutri√ß√£o na Universidade de Guelph, em Ont√°rio. Um olhar mais cuidadoso, entretanto, revela uma hist√≥ria muito diferente, conclui. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Para deixar claro: a forma como estamos nos alimentando est√° nos matando‚<U+0080>ù.At√© mesmo alguns cr√≠ticos dos alimentos processados reconhecem que h√° v√°rios fatores relacionados ao aumento da obesidade, incluindo gen√©tica, urbaniza√ß√£o, renda crescente e aumento do sedentarismo. Os executivos da Nestl√© afirmam que seus produtos ajudaram a diminuir a fome e a fornecer nutrientes essenciais, e que a empresa diminuiu a quantidade de sal, gordura e a√ß√∫car de milhares de itens para torn√°-los mais saud√°veis. Por√©m, Sean Westcott, chefe de pesquisa e desenvolvimento de alimentos da Nestl√©, admitiu que a obesidade foi um efeito colateral inesperado surgido depois que alimentos processados de baixo custo se tornaram mais acess√≠veis.‚<U+0080><U+009C>N√£o sab√≠amos qual seria o impacto‚<U+0080>ù, disse ele.Parte do problema, acrescentou, √© a tend√™ncia natural que as pessoas t√™m de comer demais quando podem comprar mais alimentos. A Nestl√©, afirmou ele, se esfor√ßa para educar os consumidores quanto ao tamanho adequado das por√ß√µes e para produzir e comercializar alimentos que equilibrem ‚<U+0080><U+009C>prazer e nutri√ß√£o‚<U+0080>ù.Hoje h√° mais de 700 milh√µes de pessoas obesas no mundo, sendo 108 milh√µes crian√ßas, de acordo com uma pesquisa publicada recentemente no New England Journal of Medicine. A preval√™ncia da obesidade dobrou em 73 pa√≠ses desde 1980, contribuindo para 4 milh√µes de mortes prematuras, segundo o estudo.O problema se refere tanto √† economia quanto √† nutri√ß√£o. √<U+0080> medida que as multinacionais avan√ßam nos pa√≠ses em desenvolvimento, elas alteram a agricultura local, estimulando agricultores a trocar as culturas de subsist√™ncia por commodities mais rent√°veis, como cana-de-a√ß√∫car, milho e soja: a base de muitos produtos aliment√≠cios industrializados.√<U+0089> um ecossistema econ√¥mico que atrai lojas familiares, grandes varejistas, fabricantes e distribuidores de alimentos e pequenos vendedores como da Silva.Em lugares t√£o distantes como a China, √Åfrica do Sul e Col√¥mbia, o crescente poder das grandes empresas de alimentos tamb√©m se traduz em influ√™ncia pol√≠tica, o que impede que autoridades em sa√∫de p√∫blica consigam taxar refrigerantes ou criar leis destinadas a restringir os impactos dos alimentos processados na sa√∫de.Para um n√∫mero crescente de nutricionistas, a epidemia da obesidade est√° intrinsecamente ligada √†s vendas de alimentos industrializados, que cresceram 25% no mundo todo de 2011 a 2016, em compara√ß√£o com 10% nos Estados Unidos, de acordo com a Euromonitor, uma empresa de pesquisa de mercado. Uma mudan√ßa ainda mais dr√°stica ocorreu em rela√ß√£o aos refrigerantes carbonatados: as vendas na Am√©rica Latina dobraram desde 2000, ultrapassando o consumo na Am√©rica do Norte em 2013, segundo a Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de.A mesma tend√™ncia se reflete no mercado de fast food, que obteve um crescimento mundial de 30% no mundo de 2011 a 2016, comparado com 21% nos Estados Unidos, de acordo com a Euromonitor. A Domino‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Pizza, por exemplo, abriu, em 2016, 1.216 lojas ‚<U+0080><U+0093> uma ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a cada sete horas‚<U+0080>ù, segundo seu relat√≥rio anual ‚<U+0080><U+0093> todas, com exce√ß√£o de 171, fora dos Estados Unidos.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Em uma √©poca em que o crescimento ocorre de forma mais moderada nas economias estabelecidas, acredito que a postura mais en√©rgica no mercado emergente ir√° prevalecer‚<U+0080>ù, afirmou recentemente o diretor-executivo da Nestl√© a investidores. Os mercados em desenvolvimento hoje s√£o respons√°veis por 42% das vendas da empresa.Para algumas empresas do ramo, isso significa mirar especificamente no p√∫blico jovem, como Ahmet Bozer, presidente da Coca-Cola, descreveu a investidores em 2014. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Metade da popula√ß√£o mundial n√£o tomou uma Coca nos √∫ltimos 30 dias‚<U+0080>ù, disse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>H√° 600 milh√µes de adolescentes que n√£o tomaram uma Coca na √∫ltima semana. Ent√£o temos uma enorme oportunidade‚<U+0080>ù.Aqueles que defendem a ind√∫stria afirmam que os alimentos processados s√£o essenciais para alimentar um mundo cada vez maior e mais urbanizado de pessoas, muitas delas com renda crescente e que demandam praticidade.‚<U+0080><U+009C>N√£o vamos acabar com todas as f√°bricas e voltar a cultivar apenas gr√£os. Isso n√£o faz sentido. N√£o vai dar certo‚<U+0080>ù, disse Mike Gibney, professor em√©rito de alimenta√ß√£o e sa√∫de na University College Dublin e consultor da Nestl√©. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Se eu pedisse para 100 fam√≠lias brasileiras que parem de consumir alimentos processados, teria que me perguntar: o que elas comer√£o? Quem as alimentar√°? Quanto isso vai custar?‚<U+0080>ùDe muitas formas, o Brasil √© um microcosmo de como rendimentos crescentes e pol√≠ticas governamentais fizeram com que a popula√ß√£o vivesse mais tempo e com mais qualidade e tamb√©m serviram para erradicar amplamente a fome. Mas, agora o Brasil enfrenta um novo e dif√≠cil desafio de nutri√ß√£o: na √∫ltima d√©cada, a taxa de obesidade do pa√≠s quase dobrou para 20%, e a parcela de pessoas com sobrepeso praticamente triplicou, indo para 58%. A cada ano, 300 mil pessoas s√£o diagnosticadas com diabetes tipo II, uma doen√ßa relacionada √† obesidade.Tamb√©m chama a aten√ß√£o, no Brasil, a habilidade pol√≠tica da ind√∫stria. Em 2010, uma coaliz√£o de empresas de alimentos e bebidas brasileiras destruiu uma s√©rie de medidas que buscavam limitar an√∫ncios de junk food destinados a crian√ßas. A √∫ltima amea√ßa veio do presidente Michel Temer, um pol√≠tico de centro favor√°vel ao setor empresarial cujos aliados conservadores do Congresso est√£o procurando impedir essa s√©rie de regula√ß√µes e leis cuja inten√ß√£o √© estimular uma alimenta√ß√£o mais saud√°vel.‚<U+0080><U+009C>O que temos √© uma guerra entre dois regimes alimentares, uma dieta tradicional com alimentos de verdade, produzidos por agricultores locais, e os produtores de alimentos ultraprocessados, feitos para serem consumidos em excesso e que, em alguns casos, viciam‚<U+0080>ù, explicou Carlos A. Monteiro, professor de nutri√ß√£o e sa√∫de p√∫blica na Universidade de S√£o Paulo.‚<U+0080><U+009C>√<U+0089> uma guerra‚<U+0080>ù, afirmou, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>mas um dos regimes alimentares tem um poder desproporcionalmente maior ao do outro‚<U+0080>ù.Da Silva chega aos consumidores das favelas de Fortaleza, muitos dos quais n√£o t√™m acesso imediato a supermercados. Ela defende o produto que vende, exaltando as informa√ß√µes nutricionais dos r√≥tulos que se vangloriam de acrescentar vitaminas e minerais aos produtos.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Todo mundo aqui sabe que os produtos da Nestl√© s√£o bons‚<U+0080>ù, assegurou ao apontar para latas de Mucilon, um mingau para beb√™s cujo r√≥tulo diz: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cont√©m c√°lcio e niacina‚<U+0080>ù, e tamb√©m para as de Nescau 2.0, um achocolatado em p√≥ altamente a√ßucarado.Ela tornou-se vendedora da Nestl√© dois anos atr√°s, quando sua fam√≠lia de cinco pessoas lutava para sobreviver. Embora o marido ainda esteja desempregado, a situa√ß√£o est√° melhorando. Com os cerca de 570 reais por m√™s que ganha com a venda dos produtos Nestl√©, conseguiu comprar uma geladeira nova, uma televis√£o e um fog√£o a g√°s para a casa de tr√™s quartos da fam√≠lia, que fica √† beira de um manguezal f√©tido.O programa de venda porta a porta da empresa faz jus a um conceito articulado pela Nestl√© em seu relat√≥rio anual de acionistas em 1976 que mencionava que ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a integra√ß√£o com o pa√≠s anfitri√£o √© um objetivo b√°sico da nossa empresa‚<U+0080>ù. Iniciado h√° uma d√©cada no Brasil, atende 700 mil ‚<U+0080><U+009C>consumidores de baixa renda mensalmente‚<U+0080>ù, de acordo com o site da Nestl√©. Apesar da crise econ√¥mica incessante no pa√≠s, o programa vem crescendo 10% por ano, segundo Felipe Barbosa, supervisor da empresa.Ele afirmou que a queda na renda dos brasileiros pobres e trabalhadores na verdade beneficiou as vendas diretas. Isso porque, ao contr√°rio da maioria da venda de alimentos por varejo, a Nestl√© oferece aos clientes um prazo de um m√™s para o pagamento das contas. O fato de as revendedoras ‚<U+0080><U+0093> o programa emprega apenas mulheres ‚<U+0080><U+0093> saberem quando seus clientes recebem o Bolsa Fam√≠lia, um subs√≠dio para fam√≠lias de baixa renda, tamb√©m ajuda nas vendas.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A ess√™ncia do nosso programa √© alcan√ßar os pobres‚<U+0080>ù, revelou Barbosa. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>O que faz ele dar certo √© a liga√ß√£o pessoal entre a revendedora e o cliente‚<U+0080>ù.A Nestl√© procura, cada vez mais, descrever-se como l√≠der em seu compromisso com a sociedade e a sa√∫de. Duas d√©cadas atr√°s, designou-se como uma ‚<U+0080><U+009C>empresa de sa√∫de e bem-estar em nutri√ß√£o‚<U+0080>ù.Ao longo dos anos, afirma, a empresa reformulou aproximadamente 9 mil produtos com o intuito de reduzir o sal, o a√ß√∫car e a gordura, e distribuiu bilh√µes de por√ß√µes fortificadas com vitaminas e minerais. A Nestl√© destaca a seguran√ßa alimentar e a redu√ß√£o do desperd√≠cio de alimentos e trabalha com cerca de 400 mil agricultores no mundo todo para promover a agricultura sustent√°vel.Em uma entrevista no novo e amplo campus de 50 milh√µes de d√≥lares na periferia de Cleveland, Ohio, o chefe de pesquisa e desenvolvimento de alimentos, Westcott, disse que o programa de vendas porta a porta reflete outro slogan da empresa: a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cria√ß√£o de valores compartilhados‚<U+0080>ù.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Criamos valor compartilhado ao gerar microempres√°rios: pessoas que conseguem montar seu pr√≥prio neg√≥cio‚<U+0080>ù, afirmou. Uma empresa como a Nestl√© pode impulsionar o bem-estar de comunidades inteiras ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ao enviar de fato mensagens positivas sobre nutri√ß√£o‚<U+0080>ù, concluiu.O cat√°logo de alimentos da Nestl√© √© vasto e diferente do de outras empresas que produzem produtos para refei√ß√µes r√°pidas e fazem pouco esfor√ßo para se concentrar em ofertas saud√°veis. A lista inclui o Nesfit, um cereal integral; iogurtes com baixo teor de gordura, como o Molico, que cont√©m uma quantidade relativamente pequena de a√ß√∫car (6 gramas); e uma variedade de cereais para crian√ßas que devem ser servidos com leite ou √°gua e s√£o fortificados com vitaminas, ferro e probi√≥ticos.Dr. Gibney, nutricionista e consultor da Nestl√©, afirmou que a empresa merece reconhecimento por ter reformulado produtos para torn√°-los mais saud√°veis.Apesar dos 800 produtos que a Nestl√© afirma estarem dispon√≠veis por meio de suas revendedoras, da Silva diz que seus clientes est√£o mais interessados em cerca de duas d√∫zias deles, praticamente todos a√ßucarados, como Kit-Kats, o iogurte grego de frutas vermelhas cujo pote de 100 gramas cont√©m 17 gramas de a√ß√∫car; e o Chandelle Pa√ßoca, uma sobremesa l√°ctea aromatizada com amendoim cuja embalagem do mesmo tamanho cont√©m 20 gramas de a√ß√∫car; apenas 5 gramas a menos do limite recomendado pela Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de.At√© pouco tempo atr√°s, a Nestl√© patrocinava uma barca√ßa que entregava dezenas de milhares de embalagens de leite em p√≥, iogurte, sobremesas l√°cteas de chocolate, biscoitos e balas a comunidades isoladas da bacia Amaz√¥nica. Desde que o barco interrompeu suas atividades em julho, donos de barcos privados assumiram a demanda.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Por um lado, a Nestl√© √© l√≠der mundial em √°gua e f√≥rmulas para lactentes e em v√°rios produtos l√°cteos‚<U+0080>ù, ressaltou Barry Popkin, professor de nutri√ß√£o da Universidade da Carolina do Norte. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Por outro lado, eles est√£o indo para os rinc√µes do Brasil vender balas‚<U+0080>ù.Dr. Popkin acha que a venda porta a porta √© emblem√°tica de uma nova era insidiosa em que as empresas n√£o deixam de atender nenhuma casa, em uma tentativa de crescer e se tornarem essenciais para as comunidades do mundo em desenvolvimento. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eles n√£o est√£o deixando nenhum canto do pa√≠s de lado‚<U+0080>ù, concluiu.Defensores da sa√∫de p√∫blica j√° haviam criticado a empresa antes. Nos anos 1970, a Nestl√© foi alvo de um boicote nos Estados Unidos por causa da comercializa√ß√£o intensa de f√≥rmulas para lactentes nos pa√≠ses em desenvolvimento, consideradas por nutricionistas prejudiciais √† amamenta√ß√£o saud√°vel. Em 1978, o presidente da Nestl√© Brasil, Oswaldo Ballarin, foi chamado para depor em audi√™ncias do senado americano que tratavam da quest√£o das f√≥rmulas para lactentes e foram amplamente divulgadas. Ballarin declarou que as cr√≠ticas eram obra da Igreja que visava ‚<U+0080><U+009C>destruir o sistema de livre iniciativa‚<U+0080>ù.Nas ruas de Fortaleza, onde a Nestl√© √© admirada por sua origem su√≠√ßa e considerada uma empresa de alta qualidade, quase nunca se ouve algo negativo sobre ela.A casa de Joana D‚<U+0080><U+0099>arc de Vasconcellos, 53, tamb√©m vendedora, est√° repleta de animais de pel√∫cia da marca e decorada com certificados que recebeu em aulas de nutri√ß√£o patrocinadas pela Nestl√©. Em sua sala de estar, os porta-retratos com as fotos dos filhos com 2 anos, cada um diante de uma pilha de latas de f√≥rmulas para lactentes vazias, ocupam posi√ß√£o de destaque. √<U+0080> medida que o filho e a filha cresciam, ela substituiu os produtos por outros da marca feitos para crian√ßas, como Nido Kinder, um leite em p√≥ para crian√ßas pequenas; Chocapic, um cereal com sabor de chocolate; e o achocolatado em p√≥ Nescau.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quando meu filho era beb√™, ele n√£o gostava de comer at√© que eu comecei a lhe oferecer produtos da Nestl√©‚<U+0080>ù, contou com orgulho.De Vasconcellos tem diabetes e hipertens√£o. A filha de 17 anos, que pesa mais de 113 quilos, tem hipertens√£o e s√≠ndrome do ov√°rio polic√≠stico, uma disfun√ß√£o hormonal altamente relacionada √† obesidade. Muitos de seus parentes sofrem de uma ou mais doen√ßas associadas √† m√° alimenta√ß√£o: a m√£e e duas irm√£s t√™m diabetes e hipertens√£o e o marido, hipertens√£o. O pai morreu tr√™s anos atr√°s depois de perder o p√© devido √† gangrena, uma complica√ß√£o do diabetes.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Toda vez que vou ao posto de sa√∫de, meus exames de diabetes est√£o l√° em cima‚<U+0080>ù, contou. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Seria muito dif√≠cil voc√™ encontrar aqui uma fam√≠lia que n√£o tenha diabetes‚<U+0080>ù.De Vasconcellos tentou anteriormente vender Tupperware e produtos Avon porta a porta, mas muitos clientes n√£o pagavam. Seis anos atr√°s, depois de uma amiga lhe contar sobre o programa de vendas diretas da Nestl√©, Vasconcellos se agarrou √† oportunidade.Ela diz que seus clientes nunca deixaram de pagar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>As pessoas t√™m que comer‚<U+0080>ù, explicou.Em maio de 2000, Denise Coitinho, √† √©poca diretora de nutri√ß√£o do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de, estava em uma festa de Dia das M√£es na escola dos filhos quando seu celular tocou. Era o chefe de rela√ß√µes governamentais da Nestl√©. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ele estava muito chateado‚<U+0080>ù, lembrou.A fonte de preocupa√ß√£o da Nestl√© era uma nova pol√≠tica adotada pelo Brasil e que pressionava a Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de. Se fosse seguida pela OMS, a organiza√ß√£o recomendaria que crian√ßas de todo o mundo fossem amamentadas por seis meses, em vez da recomenda√ß√£o anterior de quatro a seis meses, explicou.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dois meses podem n√£o parecer tanto, mas significam muita receita. Representam muita venda‚<U+0080>ù, esclarece Coitinho, que deixou o cargo em 2004 e agora trabalha como consultora de nutri√ß√£o independente para, entre outros, as Na√ß√µes Unidas. No fim, as empresas que produzem alimentos para lactentes conseguiram barrar a politica por um ano, revelou Coitinho; a Nestl√© afirmou, em resposta ao relato de Coitinho, que ‚<U+0080><U+009C>acredita que o leite materno seja a nutri√ß√£o ideal para beb√™s‚<U+0080>ù e que apoia e promove as orienta√ß√µes da Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de.√<U+0089> dif√≠cil superestimar o poder econ√¥mico e o acesso pol√≠tico dos conglomerados de alimentos e bebidas, respons√°veis por 10% da produ√ß√£o econ√¥mica do pa√≠s e por empregar 1,6 milh√£o de pessoas.Em 2014, as empresas aliment√≠cias doaram quase 500 milh√µes de reais a membros do Congresso Nacional, um aumento de tr√™s vezes em rela√ß√£o a 2010, de acordo com a Transpar√™ncia Brasil. Um estudo lan√ßado no ano passado pela organiza√ß√£o revelou que mais da metade dos atuais legisladores federais do pa√≠s foi eleita com doa√ß√µes da ind√∫stria de alimentos antes de o Supremo Tribunal Federal proibir contribui√ß√µes de empresas em 2015.O maior doador para candidatos do Congresso foi a gigante produtora de carnes JBS, que doou quase 350 milh√µes de reais a candidatos. Em 2014, a Coca-Cola deu mais de 20 milh√µes de reais em contribui√ß√µes de campanha, e o McDonald‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, cerca de 1.7 milh√£o de reais.Portanto, estava armado o palco para uma batalha pol√≠tica descomunal quando, em 2006, o governo buscou promulgar regula√ß√µes de amplo alcance para a ind√∫stria aliment√≠cia, visando reduzir a obesidade e outras doen√ßas. As medidas, que surgiram a partir das pol√≠ticas para amamenta√ß√£o anteriores, inclu√≠am alertas de publicidade para advertir os consumidores acerca dos altos n√≠veis de a√ß√∫car, sal e gorduras saturadas, assim como restri√ß√µes na comercializa√ß√£o para tornar menos tentadores alimentos altamente processados e bebidas a√ßucaradas, em especial aqueles destinados a crian√ßas.Tomando como exemplos os esfor√ßos bem-sucedidos do governo para reduzir a venda de tabaco, as novas regula√ß√µes proibiram marcas como Pepsi e KFC de patrocinarem eventos esportivos e culturais.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Achamos que o Brasil poderia ser um modelo para o resto do mundo, um pa√≠s que coloca o bem-estar de seus cidad√£os acima de tudo‚<U+0080>ù, disse Dirceu Raposo de Mello, ent√£o diretor da Ag√™ncia de Vigil√¢ncia Sanit√°ria, mais conhecida pela sigla Anvisa. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Infelizmente, a ind√∫stria aliment√≠cia n√£o pensava do mesmo modo‚<U+0080>ù.As ind√∫strias de alimentos atuaram de forma mais discreta, formando a Associa√ß√£o Brasileira das Ind√∫strias da Alimenta√ß√£o, um grupo lobista cujo conselho de vice-presidentes inclu√≠a executivos da Nestl√©, o gigante produtor de carnes americano Cargill e a Unilever, o conglomerado de alimentos europeu, dono de marcas como Hellmann‚<U+0080><U+0099>s, √≥leo Mazola e Ben & Jerry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s. A associa√ß√£o se recusou a comentar esta mat√©ria.Nos primeiros dias das audi√™ncias p√∫blicas, a ind√∫stria parecia estar disposta a negociar as regras, mas militantes de sa√∫de afirmam que, por tr√°s dos bastidores, os advogados e lobistas da ind√∫stria aliment√≠cia conduziam silenciosamente uma campanha ampla para impedir o processo.Acad√™micos financiados pela ind√∫stria come√ßaram a aparecer na TV para acusar as normas de serem economicamente desastrosas. Outros especialistas escreveram artigos em jornais, sugerindo que o exerc√≠cio f√≠sico e o controle mais rigoroso dos pais seriam mais eficazes que as regula√ß√µes no combate √† obesidade infantil.O apelo mais eficiente da ind√∫stria, garantem os analistas, foi sua den√∫ncia veemente das restri√ß√µes de propaganda propostas como censura. A acusa√ß√£o teve uma repercuss√£o especial devido √†s quase duas d√©cadas de ditadura militar que terminaram em 1985.Em uma reuni√£o, um representante da ind√∫stria aliment√≠cia acusou a Anvisa de tentar subverter a autoridade dos pais, afirmando que as m√£es tinham o direito de decidir o que dar de comer aos filhos, lembrou Vanessa Schotz, que advoga em defesa da nutri√ß√£o. Em outra reuni√£o, conta ela, um representante da ind√∫stria de brinquedos ficou de p√© e criticou com veem√™ncia as regras de comercializa√ß√£o propostas, afirmando que elas privariam as crian√ßas brasileiras dos brinquedos que √†s vezes v√™m junto das refei√ß√µes de fast food. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ele disse que est√°vamos matando os sonhos das crian√ßas, argumentando que elas valorizam mais os brinquedos do que os alimentos‚<U+0080>ù, recordou Schotz. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ficamos estupefatos‚<U+0080>ù.Repreendida pelas cr√≠ticas da ind√∫stria, a Anvisa retirou, no final de 2010, a maioria das restri√ß√µes propostas.Restou apenas uma √∫nica proposta para que os an√∫ncios inclu√≠ssem um alerta sobre alimentos e bebidas que prejudicam a sa√∫de.Ent√£o vieram as a√ß√µes judiciais.Ao longo de v√°rios meses, grupos d√≠spares da ind√∫stria apresentaram 11 a√ß√µes judiciais contra a Anvisa. Os requerentes inclu√≠am a Associa√ß√£o Nacional das Ind√∫strias de Biscoitos, o lobby dos produtores de milho e uma associa√ß√£o de empresas de chocolates, cacau e balas. Alguns dos processos alegavam que a regula√ß√£o violava prote√ß√µes constitucionais que garantiam a liberdade de express√£o, enquanto outros afirmavam que n√£o era compet√™ncia da ag√™ncia regular as ind√∫strias de alimentos e a propaganda.Embora aqueles que advogam em benef√≠cio da sa√∫de afirmem que o lit√≠gio n√£o foi totalmente inesperado, eles foram surpreendidos pela resposta do principal advogado do governo federal, o Advogado-Geral da Uni√£o Lu√≠s In√°cio Adams, nomeado pelo presidente da Rep√∫blica. Pouco depois que as regras propostas foram oficialmente publicadas em junho de 2010, Adams uniu-se √† ind√∫stria. Algumas semanas depois, um tribunal federal suspendeu as regula√ß√µes citando a opini√£o escrita do advogado, que sugeria que a Anvisa n√£o tinha a autoridade para regular as ind√∫strias aliment√≠cia e publicit√°ria. Adams recusou-se a comentar esta mat√©ria.Raposo de Mello, ex-presidente da Anvisa, revelou que ficou at√¥nito diante da mudan√ßa de orienta√ß√£o de Adams, dado o apoio de longa data do Advogado-Geral √† Anvisa. Sete anos depois, com a maioria das 11 a√ß√µes n√£o solucionada, as regula√ß√µes permanecem paradas.‚<U+0080><U+009C>A ind√∫stria‚<U+0080>ù, falou de Mello, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>deu a volta no sistema‚<U+0080>ù.Enquanto isso, as ind√∫strias de alimentos e de bebidas tornaram-se mais agressivas em sua tentativa de neutralizar a Anvisa, considerada seu maior advers√°rio.Em 2010, em meio √† batalha contra as regula√ß√µes propostas pela ag√™ncia, um grupo de 156 executivos de empresas levou suas queixas √† campanha de Dilma Rousseff, que concorria √† Presid√™ncia.Marcello Fragano Baird, cientista politico de S√£o Paulo que estudou o lobby da ind√∫stria de alimentos contra as regula√ß√µes nutricionais, contou que Rousseff garantiu aos executivos que iria intervir na Anvisa. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ela prometeu que ‚<U+0080><U+0098>limparia a casa‚<U+0080><U+0099> quando se elegesse‚<U+0080>ù, assegurou ele, acrescentando que soube do encontro por meio de entrevistas com os participantes.Rousseff venceu a elei√ß√£o e, logo que tomou posse, substituiu Raposo de Mello por Jaime C√©sar de Moura Oliveira, um aliado politico de longa data e ex-advogado da subsidi√°ria brasileira da Unilever.O porta-voz de Rousseff n√£o aceitou que ela concedesse uma entrevista a respeito.Em 2012, a Anvisa abrigou uma exposi√ß√£o itinerante de combate √† obesidade que ocupou outros edif√≠cios p√∫blicos do pa√≠s.Intitulada ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Emagrece, Brasil‚<U+0080>ù, a exibi√ß√£o exaltava o exerc√≠cio f√≠sico e a modera√ß√£o como chaves para combater a obesidade, mas minimizava a evid√™ncia cient√≠fica dominante sobre os riscos de consumir muito a√ß√∫car, refrigerantes e alimentos processados.O patrocinador da exposi√ß√£o? A Coca-Cola.Mais de 1600 quil√¥metros ao sul de Fortaleza, em uma sala de aula pintada com cores vibrantes perto do centro de S√£o Paulo, os efeitos da mudan√ßa nos h√°bitos alimentares s√£o evidentes. A cada dia, mais de cem crian√ßas enchem o local, onde cantam o alfabeto e cochilam em grupo.Quando foi inaugurada, no come√ßo da d√©cada de 1990, a organiza√ß√£o n√£o-governamental, tinha uma miss√£o espec√≠fica: acabar com a desnutri√ß√£o de crian√ßas de alguns dos bairros mais pobres da cidade.Hoje, muitas das crian√ßas que frequentam a ONG est√£o visivelmente rechonchudas e, segundo a equipe de nutricionistas, preocupantemente baixas para a idade, resultado de dietas ricas em sal, gordura e a√ß√∫car, por√©m carentes em alimentos necess√°rios para um desenvolvimento saud√°vel.Os programas de assist√™ncia a crian√ßas incluem crian√ßas de 10 anos com pr√©-diabetes e n√≠veis de gordura alarmantes no f√≠gado, adolescentes hipertensos e crian√ßas de 3 anos t√£o malnutridas que t√™m dificuldade para andar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Est√£o chegando beb√™s, algo que nunca vimos antes‚<U+0080>ù, revela Giuliano Giovanetti, que faz a divulga√ß√£o e a comunica√ß√£o para o centro. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>√<U+0089> uma crise para nossa sociedade porque estamos criando uma gera√ß√£o de crian√ßas com comprometimento cognitivo que n√£o atingir√£o todo seu potencial‚<U+0080>ù.Cerca de 9% das crian√ßas brasileiras estavam obesas em 2015, um aumento de mais de 270% desde 1980, de acordo com um estudo recente do Instituto de M√©tricas e Avalia√ß√£o em Sa√∫de da Universidade de Washington. Isso coloca o pa√≠s bem pr√≥ximo dos Estados Unidos, onde 12,7% das crian√ßas tinham obesidade em 2015.Os n√∫meros s√£o ainda mais preocupantes nas comunidades atendidas pelo Centro de Recupera√ß√£o e Educa√ß√£o Nutricional (CREN): em alguns bairros, 30% das crian√ßas t√™m obesidade e outras 30% sofrem de desnutri√ß√£o, segundo os dados da organiza√ß√£o, que descobriu que 6% das crian√ßas obesas tamb√©m est√£o desnutridas.As taxas crescentes de obesidade est√£o, em grande parte, associadas √† melhora na economia, pois fam√≠lias com melhor padr√£o aquisitivo adotam os alimentos industrializados por sua comodidade, prest√≠gio e sabor.Pais ocupados, n√£o para de oferecer aos filhos pequenos macarr√£o instant√¢neo e nuggets de frango congelados, refei√ß√µes em geral acompanhadas de refrigerantes. Arroz, feij√£o, salada e carne grelhada ‚<U+0080><U+0093> a base da dieta brasileira tradicional ‚<U+0080><U+0093> est√£o sendo colocados de lado, segundo estudos.O problema √© agravado pela viol√™ncia galopante nas ruas, que mant√©m as crian√ßas presas em casa.‚<U+0080><U+009C>√<U+0089> muito perigoso deixar meus filhos brincarem l√° fora, ent√£o eles passam todo o tempo livre no sof√°, jogando v√≠deo game e vendo TV‚<U+0080>ù, disse Elaine Pereira dos Santos, 35, m√£e de dois filhos de 9 e 4 anos, os dois com sobrepeso.Isaac, de 9 anos, pesa 62,5 quilos e s√≥ consegue vestir roupas feitas para adolescentes. Dos Santos, que trabalha na farm√°cia de um hospital, encurta as cal√ßas para o menino.Como muitas m√£es brasileiras, ela ficou contente quando o filho come√ßou a ganhar peso quando pequeno, n√£o muito tempo depois de ele ter provado a primeira batata frita do McDonald‚<U+0080><U+0099>s. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sempre pensei que beb√™s deviam ser gordinhos‚<U+0080>ù, explica. Ela satisfez com alegria os h√°bitos alimentares do filho, que inclu√≠am idas frequentes a restaurantes de fast food e quase nenhuma fruta ou vegetal.No entanto, quando o menino come√ßou a ter dificuldades para correr e a reclamar de dor nos joelhos, dos Santos percebeu que havia algo errado. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A parte mais dif√≠cil √© a goza√ß√£o das outras crian√ßas‚<U+0080>ù, conta. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quando vamos fazer compras, at√© os adultos apontam para ele e ficam encarando‚<U+0080>ù ou lhe chamam de gordinho.Na sala de aula em S√£o Paulo, profissionais da sa√∫de acompanham o desenvolvimento f√≠sico e cognitivo das crian√ßas, enquanto nutricionistas ensinam os pais a preparar refei√ß√µes de baixo custo que incluem arroz, feij√£o e salada. Para algumas crian√ßas, a cozinha experimental do centro √© seu primeiro contato com alimentos como repolhos, ameixas e mangas.Um dos principais desafios √© convencer os pais de que seus filhos est√£o doentes. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Diferentemente do c√¢ncer ou outras doen√ßas, esse problema n√£o √© vis√≠vel‚<U+0080>ù, explica Juliana Dellare Calia, 42, nutricionista da organiza√ß√£o.Embora membros da equipe afirmem que o programa tenha feito avan√ßos significativos ao mudar a maneira como as fam√≠lias se alimentam, muitas crian√ßas, no entanto, enfrentar√£o uma batalha contra a obesidade pelo resto da vida. Isso porque pesquisas sugerem que a desnutri√ß√£o na inf√¢ncia pode levar a altera√ß√µes metab√≥licas permanentes que reprogramam o organismo de forma que ele passa a transformar o excesso de calorias em gordura corporal com mais facilidade.‚<U+0080><U+009C>√<U+0089> a resposta do corpo ao que ele entende como fome‚<U+0080>ù, explica Dellare Calia.Mesmo que os especialistas em nutri√ß√£o lamentem a crescente crise de obesidade, bem como os riscos potenciais de longo prazo, um aspecto da revolu√ß√£o dos alimentos processados no Brasil √© ineg√°vel: a expans√£o da ind√∫stria beneficia pessoas de v√°rios n√≠veis sociais. A Nestl√©, que afirma empregar 21 mil pessoas no pa√≠s, come√ßou h√° dois anos um programa de est√°gio que ofereceu treinamento para 7 mil pessoas com menos de 30 anos.Perto da base da cadeia alimentar encontra-se da Silva, a vendedora de Fortaleza, que se sente otimista quanto ao futuro, apesar de seus crescentes problemas de sa√∫de. A vida tem sido uma luta desde que deixou a escola aos 14 anos, quando engravidou da primeira filha. Agora ela quer arrumar o dente cuja falta lhe estraga o sorriso hesitante e comprar uma casa mais apropriada, uma que n√£o tenha goteiras quando chove forte.Ela agradece √† Nestl√©.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pela primeira vez na vida, tenho esperan√ßa e me sinto independente‚<U+0080>ù, diz.Est√° ciente da rela√ß√£o entre a dieta e seus problemas de sa√∫de persistentes, mas insiste em que os filhos est√£o bem nutridos, enquanto aponta para os produtos da Nestl√© em sua sala de estar. Ser uma vendedora da Nestl√© tem outra vantagem: os biscoitos, chocolates e sobremesas que muitas vezes sustentam sua fam√≠lia s√£o comprados por atacado.Com uma lista crescente de clientes, Da Silva concentra-se em outro objetivo que visa a aumentar ainda mais o neg√≥cio.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quero comprar uma geladeira maior‚<U+0080>ù.ESCADA, Brasil ‚<U+0080><U+0094> N√£o se avistava viva alma na rua estreita e empoeirada, a n√£o ser um gato que se esgueirava sob uma lua quarto minguante.Eram √†s duas e meia da madrugada e, em uma pequena casa cor-de-rosa, localizada no topo de um terreno no alto de 29 degraus irregulares esculpidos em um talude de barro vermelho, Vera L√∫cia da Silva arrumava sua beb√™ para irem para Recife, a duas horas e meia de dist√¢ncia dali. Embalando Sophia Valentina, ela caminhou por 40 minutos pela cidade adormecida antes de subir na van do governo para mais uma viagem nada confort√°vel num percurso repleto de sacolejos, chegando no destino logo ap√≥s o nascer do sol. M√£e e filha percorrem esse √°rduo trajeto v√°rias vezes por semana. Essa √© a √∫nica maneira de obter o tratamento m√©dico e receber as terapias que a Sophia necessita para uma s√©rie de problemas graves causados pelo zika v√≠rus.Hoje a Sophia tem pouco mais de um ano de idade, portanto, ela nasceu durante a epidemia de zika. Ela faz parte de um grupo de quase 2.500 beb√™s nascidos de m√£es infectadas pelo v√≠rus no Brasil, com danos cerebrais t√£o profundos que suas consequ√™ncias apenas come√ßam a ser compreendidas.Treze meses ap√≥s a declara√ß√£o de emerg√™ncia de sa√∫de p√∫blica internacional de zika pela Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de, o n√≠vel de alarme p√∫blico sobre o v√≠rus transmitido por mosquitos que se espalhou pela Am√©rica Latina est√° se reduzindo. Em novembro passado, a OMS suspendeu o status de emerg√™ncia, entretanto n√£o √© poss√≠vel dizer que o zika v√≠rus est√° desaparecendo. Milhares de novas infec√ß√µes por zika continuam sendo relatadas em toda a Am√©rica Latina, e funcion√°rios da OMS dizem que a a√ß√£o da entidade meramente aponta que, como a mal√°ria ou a febre amarela, a zika √© uma amea√ßa de longo prazo na regi√£o, ao inv√©s de uma pandemia urgente.Por√©m, para as fam√≠lias brasileiras dos beb√™s com zika, os efeitos terr√≠veis da infec√ß√£o pelo v√≠rus est√£o apenas se intensificando. Essa realidade √© principalmente vivida nas cidades e vilarejos pobres do Nordeste do pa√≠s, regi√£o na qual foi detectada, pela primeira vez, a conex√£o entre o v√≠rus misterioso e os beb√™s nascidos com cabe√ßas disformes e de tamanho reduzido e l√° centenas de fam√≠lias est√£o lutando para dar a essas crian√ßas a melhor vida poss√≠vel.Rela√ß√µes familiares foram destru√≠das e meios de subsist√™ncia, antes prec√°rios, foram devastados. Alguns pais e m√£es tiveram que deixar de trabalhar para se dedicarem aos cuidados do filho. Ao mesmo tempo, os altos √≠ndices de gravidez na adolesc√™ncia no Brasil acrescentam mais um n√≠vel de dificuldades, uma vez que, muitas adolescentes com aparelhos nos dentes e tarefas escolares por fazer, acabam sendo m√£es de beb√™s afetados pela doen√ßa.M√©dicos e pesquisadores est√£o apenas come√ßando a entender a zika e suas consequ√™ncias m√©dicas. Muitos beb√™s nasceram com cabe√ßas dramaticamente pequenas, caracter√≠stica da microcefalia, mas seus problemas aumentaram e diversificaram-se, o que levou os especialistas a rebatizar sua condi√ß√£o como ‚<U+0080><U+009C>s√≠ndrome cong√™nita do zika v√≠rus‚<U+0080>ù. Esses beb√™s podem ter convuls√µes; problemas respirat√≥rios; dificuldades para engolir; fraqueza e rigidez nos m√∫sculos e articula√ß√µes que os impede de levantar a cabe√ßa; p√©-torto cong√™nito, problemas de vis√£o e audi√ß√£o, e crises de choro que s√£o extremamente dif√≠ceis de cessar.Essas crian√ßas passaram do seu primeiro ano de vida, mas, segundo os m√©dicos, t√™m desenvolvimento neurol√≥gico similar ao de beb√™s de 3 meses de idade. Alguns quadros de microcefalia s√£o t√£o extremos que os especialistas chegam a compar√°-los a uma variante chamada de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sequ√™ncia de disrup√ß√£o cerebral fetal‚<U+0080>ù, uma variante anterior t√£o rara que era vista somente em um grupo reduzido de casos. Al√©m disso, novas dificuldades continuam se acumulando e a Sophia recentemente passou por cirurgia para resolver mais um problema: hidrocefalia, o excesso de l√≠quido no c√©rebro.Atualmente, est√£o sendo identificados casos de crian√ßas com defici√™ncias que pareciam normais ao nascer. Em algumas delas, a microcefalia e outros sintomas est√£o surgindo meses mais tarde, quando seus c√©rebros; com c√©lulas enfraquecidas ou destru√≠das, √°reas com m√°s-forma√ß√µes e ac√∫mulos de l√≠quido; n√£o conseguem se desenvolver o suficiente para corresponder ao crescimento f√≠sico. Os especialistas preveem que mais crian√ßas, que at√© o momento parecem n√£o haver sido afetadas pelo zika v√≠rus, possam vir a apresentar problemas antes dos 3 anos ou na idade escolar.Os m√©dicos ainda n√£o conhecem a extens√£o total da doen√ßa, disse a Dra. Vanessa Van der Linden, neuropediatra de Recife que ajudou a descobrir a liga√ß√£o entre zika e microcefalia. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>S√≥ sabemos o que √© f√°cil de se ver.‚<U+0080>ùA Dra. Vanessa e muitos outros m√©dicos e terapeutas dedicam-se a ajudar fam√≠lias em hospitais p√∫blicos e sem fins lucrativos e cl√≠nicas. O governo brasileiro utiliza parte de seus recursos no fornecimento de um modesto aux√≠lio para deficientes √† popula√ß√£o carente.Centenas de fam√≠lias est√£o em listas de espera para receber atendimento m√©dico. Alguns programas de terapia deixam de ser proporcionados √†s crian√ßas sob a alega√ß√£o de que o desenvolvimento delas est√° t√£o afetado que a terapia n√£o pode conseguir mais nada. No caso dos beb√™s mais velhos que ainda n√£o conseguem fazer contato visual ou interagir, a Dra. Vanessa disse: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fazer fisioterapia todos os dias n√£o significa que eles v√£o melhorar‚<U+0080>ù.Para as fam√≠lias do zika, as dificuldades est√£o apenas come√ßando. As crian√ßas ainda s√£o pequenas o suficiente para serem carregadas no colo, alimentadas e levadas de um lado para outro. No entanto, eventualmente, muitas delas poder√£o n√£o ser capazes de andar, frequentar escolas regulares ou mesmo viver sozinhas quando adultas.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Esses beb√™s, a maioria deles ou todos eles, v√£o viver vidas muito longas. Voc√™ pode mant√™-los vivos por muito tempo e eles v√£o precisar da ajuda de algu√©m 24 horas por dia‚<U+0080>ù, disse o Dr. Ernesto Marques, especialista em doen√ßas infecciosas da Universidade de Pittsburgh e da Funda√ß√£o Oswaldo Cruz em Recife. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As consequ√™ncias para a sociedade s√£o enormes‚<U+0080>ù, conclui ele.Aqui est√£o as hist√≥rias de tr√™s fam√≠lias: um casal que se manteve obstinado na sua criatividade e coragem, apesar das frequentes complica√ß√µes m√©dicas da sua filha; uma adolescente que se tornou m√£e de uma beb√™ com zika aos 14 anos e foi for√ßada a amadurecer muito al√©m da sua idade; e uns rec√©m-casados cuja rela√ß√£o n√£o p√¥de suportar as press√µes de cuidar de sua crian√ßa com defici√™ncia.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Grave risco de aspira√ß√£o‚<U+0080>ù, era o que se lia no peda√ßo de papel perto da cama onde Vera L√∫cia cobria Sophia com uma esp√©cie de casaco de beb√™ com capuz cor-de-rosa para sua caminhada no meio da madrugada para subir na van.Um m√©dico j√° havia explicado o que aquele diagn√≥stico significava: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ela vai se sufocar‚<U+0080>ù, disse Vera L√∫cia, torcendo os dedos ansiosamente, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a comida est√° indo para os pulm√µes dela‚<U+0080>ù.Sophia tinha disfagia severa, problemas de degluti√ß√£o que afligem beb√™s com zika mais velhos cujos c√©rebros n√£o podem coordenar a habilidade de comer. Os m√©dicos aconselharam a adi√ß√£o de espessante √† f√≥rmula infantil, mas avisaram que, caso isso n√£o desse certo, ela precisaria de uma sonda de alimenta√ß√£o nasog√°strica. Uma sonda anterior j√° havia feito Sophia vomitar sangue preto.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Estou pedindo a Deus para que ela n√£o precise usar a sonda de alimenta√ß√£o de novo‚<U+0080>ù, suplicou Vera L√∫cia, de 30 anos, enquanto, l√° fora, se ouviam galos cantando na escurid√£o e cachorros latindo como pregoeiros.Seu marido, Ronaldo, 34, tentou tranquiliz√°-la. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Deus‚<U+0080>ù, disse ele, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>nunca nos daria 100 quilos se n√≥s s√≥ pud√©ssemos carregar 50‚<U+0080>ù.Mas o peso que o casal carrega continua acumulando.Depois de mais uma viagem para Recife na calada da noite e horas de espera em duras cadeiras de pl√°stico na cl√≠nica da Funda√ß√£o Altino Ventura, Sophia, com um vestido com barra de babado com pequenos cora√ß√µes rosa e a palavra ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Love‚<U+0080>ù coberta de strass, foi colocada sobre uma maca.Cinco terapeutas a examinaram. Um sacudiu um chocalho amarelo perto de sua orelha. Outro tirou os min√∫sculos √≥culos lil√°s da Sophia, agitou um pompom prateado e piscou uma lanterna, mas os olhos dela mal pareciam capazes de seguir os est√≠mulos.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sophia √© uma crian√ßa com habilidades visuais, auditivas e motoras muito comprometidas‚<U+0080>ù, concluiu Kyrla Melo, fisioterapeuta. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ela n√£o tem controle da cabe√ßa, n√£o rola e n√£o se senta‚<U+0080>ù.Anteriormente, outra cl√≠nica j√° havia retirado a Sophia do grupo de fisioterapia. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A m√©dica falou que Sophia n√£o estava se desenvolvendo‚<U+0080>ù, contou Vera L√∫cia. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As crian√ßas que n√£o est√£o se desenvolvendo est√£o sendo retiradas das terapias‚<U+0080>ù.Ela estava chateada. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Acho que isso est√° muito errado. O dever deles √© trabalhar para que nossos beb√™s se desenvolvam‚<U+0080>ù.Os pais de Sophia d√£o a ela todo o apoio poss√≠vel. Eles confeccionaram vers√µes caseiras dos equipamentos de fisioterapia usados pelas cl√≠nicas: fizeram chocalhos com garrafas de Coca-Cola cheias de feij√£o, colocaram bolas coloridas de pl√°stico em uma pequena piscina infl√°vel, encheram uma cal√ßa jeans de Ronaldo com isopor para dar suporte ao corpo de Sophia para mant√™-la sentada.Um m√©dico disse ao casal que cores brilhantes poderiam estimular a vis√£o de Sophia. Ent√£o, eles pintaram a porta da casa, que era cinza, e as janelas de laranja ab√≥bora, mudaram as cortinas e as capas do sof√° para um vermelho cereja, e colocaram cortinas amarelo ouro na cozinha.A criatividade √© a segunda natureza do casal. Antes de se casar com Vera L√∫cia, Ronaldo, que trabalha pintando tubos de refinaria de petr√≥leo, passou todas as noites, durante um ano, cavando e nivelando um peda√ßo de terra coberto de mato, localizado no alto de um penhasco, preparando o terreno para construir a casa deles com telhado ondulado de telhas vermelhas e varais de roupa nas laterais.O penhasco forma uma parede em um dos lados de uma estreita rua de paralelep√≠pedos. Do outro lado da rua h√° casas com telhados no n√≠vel da cal√ßada ou abaixo, e com janelas gradeadas para intimidar os ladr√µes e os traficantes de drogas.Depois do nascimento do seu primeiro filho, Richarlisson, Vera L√∫cia, uma ex-professora, tentou engravidar por cinco anos e teve um aborto espont√¢neo. Aos tr√™s meses da gesta√ß√£o de Sophia, o bra√ßo de Vera L√∫cia foi picado por um mosquito quando ela estava perto do po√ßo de uma vizinha. Ela teve diarreia, al√©m de manchas vermelhas no bra√ßo, rosto e barriga.Um m√©dico disse que poderia ser chikungunya, uma doen√ßa transmitida por picada de mosquito que raramente tem efeitos duradouros e n√£o √© transmitida ao feto. Naquele tempo, a zika, causada pelo mesmo mosquito, n√£o era conhecida no Brasil.Tudo parecia estar bem at√© um ultrassom ser realizado aos seis meses.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sua filha tem microcefalia‚<U+0080>ù, disse um m√©dico √† Vera L√∫cia. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A cabe√ßa √© menor do que o normal e o c√©rebro da crian√ßa n√£o se desenvolveu‚<U+0080>ù.Vera L√∫cia desesperou-se. Ainda assim, duas semanas depois, quando um m√©dico comentou: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>se voc√™ n√£o quer uma crian√ßa com microcefalia, voc√™ n√£o √© obrigada a t√™-la‚<U+0080>ù. Ela rejeitou a ideia de um aborto. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>N√£o. Mesmo se ela tiver microcefalia, vou am√°-la do jeito que ela vier‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela.Ao nascer, a perna esquerda de Sophia estava presa ao corpo e uma m√©dica afirmou: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sophia Valentina n√£o vai andar‚<U+0080>ù. Vera L√∫cia ficou enfurecida.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Voc√™ acha que sabe mais do que Deus, hein?‚<U+0080>ù, ela repreendeu a m√©dica. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Minha filha nem tem 24 horas de vida‚<U+0080>ù.Dando banhos para relaxar a perna, manipulando-a delicadamente com uma tipoia de fraldas de pano, aos poucos, Vera L√∫cia e sua irm√£ conseguiram trazer a perna da beb√™ para a posi√ß√£o normal.Quando outro m√©dico disse que as m√£os de Sophia ‚<U+0080><U+009C>n√£o iriam segurar nada‚<U+0080>ù. Vera L√∫cia e Ronaldo treinaram os dedos da filha para segurar pirulitos e sacudir chocalhos.Quando os vizinhos fizeram coment√°rios maldosos, dizendo que Sophia tinha ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a cabe√ßa deformada e uma perna aleijada‚<U+0080>ù, Ronaldo convenceu sua esposa de n√£o os enfrentar. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Algumas pessoas s√£o gentis‚<U+0080>ù, disse ele, como seu chefe, que mesmo quando as dificuldades econ√¥micas for√ßaram a empresa a demitir todos seus funcion√°rios, deixando apenas sete dos 300 trabalhadores, manteve o Ronaldo no emprego.A pesar desta recomenda√ß√£o, Vera L√∫cia passou cinco meses discutindo com autoridades municipais que continuavam negando a ela uma vaga nos ve√≠culos do governo para viagens a hospitais de Recife. Ela chamou um funcion√°rio de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Satan√°s‚<U+0080>ù e, finalmente, conseguiu um assento depois de amea√ßar chamar a reportagem de um jornal e envergonhar o prefeito em ano de elei√ß√µes.Mesmo assim, sempre que os m√©dicos de Sophia marcam novas consultas, Vera L√∫cia tem que caminhar 40 minutos at√© o posto de sa√∫de, que atende em hor√°rios espec√≠ficos, para reservar pessoalmente um assento na van. √<U+0080>s vezes, elas perdem horas marcadas para poder reservar uma vaga no transporte para outra consulta.Uma manh√£, Sophia deixou de se mexer. Ela estava respirando, seus olhos estavam abertos, mas seu corpo parecia congelado.Vera L√∫cia chorou, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>com medo de perder a minha bonequinha‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela. Sophia estava fraca e malnutrida porque n√£o havia se adaptado √† sonda de alimenta√ß√£o nasal colocada duas semanas antes. Os m√©dicos disseram que ela precisaria de uma nova sonda a cada 15 dias.No m√™s seguinte, em novembro, Sophia foi hospitalizada por 10 dias por causa de uma pneumonia. Em dezembro, uma deriva√ß√£o foi colocada em seu c√©rebro, que tinha um ac√∫mulo excessivo de l√≠quido, o que chegou a causar 32 convuls√µes em um mesmo dia. Em janeiro houve mais uma hospitaliza√ß√£o por pneumonia. Sophia est√° agora em uma lista de espera para uma sonda de alimenta√ß√£o abdominal.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Minha filha √© uma guerreira‚<U+0080>ù, disse Ronaldo.No sof√° vermelho por tr√°s das persianas laranjas, Vera L√∫cia olhou angustiada e perplexa para a sua filha. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sophia Valentina‚<U+0080>ù, murmurou ela. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ela vai me surpreender‚<U+0080>ù.Al√≠cia Isabela do Nascimento Martins nasceu prematura de sete meses, em parto ces√°reo de emerg√™ncia. Ela ficou hospitalizada por 70 dias at√© que seus pulm√µes pudessem respirar por conta pr√≥pria, seu cora√ß√£o batesse constantemente e seu corpo j√° n√£o precisasse de uma sonda de alimenta√ß√£o. Mas os m√©dicos n√£o conseguiram reparar os danos cerebrais que ela sofreu quando sua m√£e foi infectada pelo v√≠rus zika durante a gravidez.Al√≠cia, atualmente com quase 18 meses de idade, tem microcefalia, rigidez muscular, convuls√µes e problemas de vis√£o, respira√ß√£o e degluti√ß√£o. Criar um beb√™ com todos esses problemas seria um desafio para qualquer pessoa, mas √çris, m√£e de Al√≠cia, tamb√©m √© praticamente uma crian√ßa. Ela deu √† luz aos 14 anos.Cerca de 450 adolescentes tiveram beb√™s com microcefalia na epidemia de zika no Brasil, de acordo com autoridades do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de. Algumas jovens fazem malabarismos entre a escola o cuidado desses beb√™s. Outras dependem de seus pais.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nunca imaginei uma situa√ß√£o assim‚<U+0080>ù, disse √çris, enquanto o aparelho dos seus dentes brilhava e ela tentava acalmar Al√≠cia com um de seus √∫nicos m√©todos bem-sucedidos: tocar repetidamente um desenho animado musical no seu celular. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Esse sentimento, essa realidade‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela, com voz tensa. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Foi devastador‚<U+0080>ù.Sua gravidez irritou a m√£e de √çris, que, apesar disso, correu com a filha para o hospital aos sete meses de gesta√ß√£o, ao inv√©s de deix√°-la perder o beb√™.Desde o in√≠cio, √çris suportou um trauma ap√≥s o outro. Uma vez o cora√ß√£o da Al√≠cia ‚<U+0080><U+009C>parou diante de mim‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela. Ela chorou quando viu que a beb√™ tinha ‚<U+0080><U+009C>uma cabe√ßa t√£o pequena‚<U+0080>ù, mas os m√©dicos esperaram um m√™s para dizer √† m√£e que a filha tinha microcefalia e calcifica√ß√µes cerebrais, diagn√≥stico confirmado por uma tomografia cerebral.Quando Al√≠cia foi finalmente teve alta do hospital, √çris mergulhou em uma depress√£o profunda, envolvida, disse ela, por ‚<U+0080><U+009C>um sentimento de rejei√ß√£o‚<U+0080>ù em rela√ß√£o √† sua beb√™. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu n√£o tinha esse ‚<U+0080><U+0098>amor de filha‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù, ela confessou.Elas se mudaram com o pai de Al√≠cia e namorado de √çris de 19 anos, T√∫lio Martins de Cristo, para a casa onde a m√£e dele morava. Ele e a m√£e alimentaram, trocaram fraldas e fizeram quase tudo para a crian√ßa.‚<U+0080><U+009C>√çris dormia‚<U+0080>ù, disse sua m√£e, Enilsa Jos√© do Nascimento, 45, enfermeira t√©cnica. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>E a beb√™ ficava ao lado de sua cama, chorando, gritando‚<U+0080>ù.√çris nem mesmo foi ao hospital quando, por duas vezes, Al√≠cia parou de respirar por apneia. √çris estava ‚<U+0080><U+009C>apagada para a vida‚<U+0080>ù, relembrou a m√£e. Sem o namorado e a m√£e dele, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>eu acho que a beb√™ teria morrido‚<U+0080>ù, comentou ela.A m√£e trazia saladas e sucos para √çris para convenc√™-la a comer. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Voc√™ tem um beb√™ que depende de voc√™‚<U+0080>ù, dizia ela para a filha. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Olha, ela n√£o √© feia. Sua beb√™ √© t√£o linda‚<U+0080>ù.Finalmente, a m√£e de T√∫lio sugeriu que √çris fosse a uma reuni√£o da Uni√£o de M√£es de Anjos (U.M.A.), um grupo com mais de 300 m√£es de beb√™s com problemas relacionados ao zika v√≠rus. Foi uma experi√™ncia esclarecedora.Ela viu m√£es com situa√ß√µes piores que a sua‚<U+0080>ù.De repente, √çris foi tomada por uma urg√™ncia em melhorar as chances de desenvolvimento de Al√≠cia, segundo ela mesma.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Poxa, levanta, √çris!‚<U+0080>ù, ela falou pra si mesma. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Meu Deus, eu estou perdendo tempo!‚<U+0080>ù.Ela falou para a m√£e: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu tenho que fazer minha filha andar. Se ela n√£o andar, ela vai enxergar‚<U+0080>ù.Tudo mudou. Atrav√©s de testes rigorosos, √çris se qualificou para um col√©gio competitivo, mas acabou mudando para uma noturna. Atualmente, ela leva Al√≠cia para, pelo menos, duas sess√µes de terapia e consultas m√©dicas diariamente, geralmente em Recife, a duas horas de dist√¢ncia e pelo menos duas viagens de √¥nibus de Paulista, sua cidade natal. Ela voltou a morar com a m√£e e com a irm√£ de 17 anos, que toma conta de Al√≠cia enquanto √çris assiste aulas, das 7 √†s 10 da noite. Depois de voltar do col√©gio, √çris faz o dever de casa, dorme por algumas horas, levantando-se quando Al√≠cia acorda, √†s vezes, √†s 4 da manh√£.No dia do primeiro anivers√°rio de Al√≠cia, √çris planejou visitas a tr√™s cl√≠nicas para tratamentos de vis√£o, est√≠mulo motor e fisioterapia. M√£e e filha visitaram tamb√©m a Dra. Cristiane Marcela Santos, especialista em otorrinolaringologia do Hospital Agamenon Magalh√£es.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quinze?‚<U+0080>ù, exclamou a Dra. Cristiane, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>voc√™ tem quinze anos?‚<U+0080>ùEla ficou surpresa com o fato de √çris ser t√£o jovem e estar t√£o bem informada.Em todo lugar, disse √çris, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu fa√ßo um monte de perguntas‚<U+0080>ù.Vestida com short cor-de-rosa e blusinha cor lavanda, o corpo de Al√≠cia se assemelha ao de um beb√™ de um ano, mas sua cabe√ßa tem 36 cent√≠metros de circunfer√™ncia, bem abaixo do normal. Ela tem boa audi√ß√£o. A diminui√ß√£o da irritabilidade √© uma evolu√ß√£o positiva, mas ela apresenta outros sintomas, como rigidez muscular. Para evitar os punhos cerrados, os dedos de Al√≠cia s√£o mantidos abertos atrav√©s do uso de uma fita adesiva rosa brilhante que, √†s vezes √© tamb√©m aplicada para relaxar os m√∫sculos das costas e do queixo.A Dra. Santos perguntou sobre os primeiros exames cerebrais de Al√≠cia.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Calcifica√ß√£o em quase todo o c√©rebro dela‚<U+0080>ù, respondeu √çris.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alguma altera√ß√£o no seu c√≥rtex cerebral?, perguntou a doutora.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Teve alguns pontos brancos‚<U+0080>ù.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ela j√° ficou alguma vez t√£o sufocada que ficou roxinha e voc√™ teve que bater nas costas dela?‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Isso acontece muito‚<U+0080>ù, disse √çris.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Muito s√©rio‚<U+0080>ù, comentou a Dra. Santos.A dedica√ß√£o materna de √çris parece ‚<U+0080><U+009C>muito segura e madura‚<U+0080>ù, disse a Dra. Santos. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A vida a fez assim. Elas param as suas pr√≥prias vidas para que possam viver a vida de seus filhos‚<U+0080>ù.Agora, pouco depois de completar 16 anos, √çris n√£o tem tempo para se angustiar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu mudei minha vida por Al√≠cia‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sou eu por ela e ela por mim‚<U+0080>ù.Os bancos estavam se enchendo de m√£es de crian√ßas com zika do lado de fora da Associa√ß√£o de Assist√™ncia a Crian√ßas com Defici√™ncia (AACD), em Recife, quando Jaqueline Vieira chegou embalando seu filho Daniel, que tinha a cabe√ßa pequena demais para o corpo de um ano e as m√£o fechadas.Os √≥culos azuis estavam presos √† cabe√ßa, e as √≥rteses azuis, decoradas com fotos de Mickey Mouse, estavam presas √†s pernas. Jaqueline sabe que as √≥rteses devem ser usadas todos os dias para consertar os ‚<U+0080><U+009C>p√©s de bailarina‚<U+0080>ù virados para fora de Daniel. Mas o metal da √≥rtese arranha a m√£e e torna desconfort√°vel segurar Daniel nos bra√ßos, ent√£o, ela a coloca principalmente para sair.Esse era o tipo de ato de equil√≠brio ao qual ela havia se acostumado. Criar beb√™s com zika √© dif√≠cil o suficiente para homens e mulheres com casamentos e rendas est√°veis, mas nem sempre a situa√ß√£o √© essa. A zika n√£o s√≥ destruiu casamentos como tamb√©m afetou a situa√ß√£o econ√¥mica de muitas pessoas. Desde o nascimento de Daniel, h√° 16 meses, Jaqueline separou-se de seu marido, perdeu sua assist√™ncia governamental mensal, desistiu de um emprego e agora consegue se manter somente com outro benef√≠cio do governo.Naquela segunda-feira, Jaqueline mal registrou que era seu 26¬∫ anivers√°rio. Durante o fim de semana anterior em Olinda, sua cidade natal, na costa, mais ao norte de Recife, Daniel havia convulsionado por tr√™s horas seguidas, at√© seus l√°bios ficarem roxos. Jaqueline temia que ele deixasse de respirar, mas n√£o conseguiria chegar a um hospital com m√©dicos de plant√£o saindo do bairro carente onde mora de madrugada, hor√°rio em que os ratos correm pelas estradas r√∫sticas de terra, mas nenhum √¥nibus circula.No mesmo dia, Jaqueline e as outras m√£es come√ßaram a comparar suas anota√ß√µes. Uma disse que n√£o conseguia encontrar o beb√™ naquela manh√£ e, da√≠, notou que ele tinha rolado e ca√≠do da cama. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Isso √© bom‚<U+0080>ù, disse outra. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ele se mexeu. Eu queria ter um beb√™ assim‚<U+0080>ù.De repente, chegou a van que iria levar todas as m√£es a um sal√£o de beleza, onde receberiam alguns mimos pagos por uma cantora local. Ao chegar no Velvet Salon, com um ambiente cheio de spray de cabelo, as m√£es deitaram seus beb√™s sobre os sof√°s vermelhos.Jaqueline deixou Daniel com uma prima porque ele fica agitado quando passa muito tempo em lugares fechados. Ela escolheu esmaltes cor p√©rola para a manicure: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She Said Yes‚<U+0080>ù como cor base e uma camada de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Kitty White‚<U+0080>ù por cima. Uma estilista deixou seu cabelo de rebeldes cachos escuros liso e brilhante. Olhando para um espelho, ela tirou uma selfie. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Olhem para mim!‚<U+0080>ù, ela se vangloriou.O f√¥lego durou pouco. Naquela tarde, o rem√©dio de Daniel acabou e ela n√£o tinha dinheiro para comprar mais.A pr√≥pria concep√ß√£o de Daniel desafiou todas as probabilidades. Jaqueline desenvolveu c√¢ncer uterino quando seu outro filho ainda era pouco mais que um beb√™. Ela se op√¥s aos aconselhamentos m√©dicos de ter seu √∫tero removido, embora os m√©dicos tenham dito que suas chances de ter outro filho eram m√≠nimas.Enquanto ainda passava por sess√µes de quimioterapia, ela come√ßou a namorar Dalton Douglas de Oliveira, de 19 anos e cinco anos mais novo. Ambos faziam parte da mesma igreja evang√©lica. Eles apressaram o matrim√¥nio ‚<U+0080><U+009C>para que a igreja n√£o soubesse que haviam tido rela√ß√µes √≠ntimas antes do casamento‚<U+0080>ù, contou Douglas.Um m√™s ap√≥s a uni√£o, ela ficou sabendo que estava gr√°vida de tr√™s meses. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Foi a maior alegria da minha vida‚<U+0080>ù, disse Jaqueline. Seu marido tamb√©m ficou feliz. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>N√≥s quer√≠amos ter um filho nosso‚<U+0080>ù, afirmou ele.Ainda assim, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a barriga nos condenou‚<U+0080>ù, complementou Douglas, causando estresse, porque o que claramente tinha sido uma concep√ß√£o pr√©-matrimonial levou a igreja a impedir a comunh√£o do casal por meses.Aos cinco meses de gravidez, Jaqueline ficou perturbada quando um m√©dico disse a ela que o ultrassom mostrava que o seu beb√™ tinha hidrocefalia, ac√∫mulo de l√≠quido no c√©rebro, e que ele poderia morrer, lembrou ela.Mas, aos sete meses de gesta√ß√£o, outro m√©dico discordou, dizendo: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Olha, seu filho √© especial, ele tem um pequeno problema, mas o que ele tem √© microcefalia‚<U+0080>ù, contou Jaqueline. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Foi uma boa not√≠cia‚<U+0080>ù.O al√≠vio dela desapareceu logo ap√≥s o nascimento de Daniel. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu pensei que era castigo de Deus porque eu engravidei quando n√£o devia ter engravidado‚<U+0080>ù, confessou ela.Os cuidados especiais que Daniel exigia criaram tens√µes no relacionamento do casal. Daniel chorava t√£o inconsoladamente, disse Jaqueline, que ‚<U+0080><U+009C>eu achei que minha vida ia acabar‚<U+0080>ù. Douglas disse que a esposa n√£o pedia ajuda a ele e admitiu que ele estava muito irritado com Jaqueline para oferecer qualquer ajuda a ela. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Meu problema era diretamente com ela e n√£o com o beb√™‚<U+0080>ù, garantiu ele.Aos dois meses de idade, Daniel acordou com dificuldades para respirar. No hospital, lembrou Jaqueline, os m√©dicos suspeitaram que mofo ou poeira em casa estavam afetando os pulm√µes dele e recomendaram melhorar a qualidade do ar da casa ou mudar para outro lugar.Douglas achava que sua esposa, envergonhada h√° tempo pela simplicidade da casa, propriedade da igreja sem exig√™ncia de aluguel, estava exagerando. Jaqueline encontrou outra casa e ele recusou-se a se mudar com ela. Depois disso, o problema detonou. Jaqueline deu entrevistas para canais de TV alegando que seu marido ‚<U+0080><U+009C>n√£o dava aten√ß√£o ao menino‚<U+0080>ù e acrescentou que a exposi√ß√£o na m√≠dia gerou algumas doa√ß√µes do exterior. Ele retaliou postando um v√≠deo no qual a insultava. Ela come√ßou a namorar e disse a ele: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tu n√£o vai ver o teu filho‚<U+0080>ù, alegou Douglas. Depois de disputas t√©cnicas sobre a pens√£o aliment√≠cia do filho, ele parou de pagar. E quando Douglas ignorou Jaqueline na rua, ela disse que ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ele estava realmente afastando-se da doen√ßa do Daniel‚<U+0080>ù.Jaqueline, ex-ajudante de padaria de uma rede de supermercados recebia assist√™ncia do governo para pessoas com c√¢ncer e passava por dificuldades para comprar Sabril, o rem√©dio para convuls√£o de Daniel que custa cerca de 300 reais por m√™s. Para ajud√°-la, um grupo de policiais come√ßou a comprar o medicamento, e ela e outras m√£es, √†s vezes, compartilhavam alguns comprimidos.Mas as crises de Daniel pioraram, aparentemente enfraquecendo sua capacidade de sustentar a cabe√ßa. Ela mostrou um v√≠deo que tinha feito no documentando um desses epis√≥dios para o neurologista. Consegue ver os seus pezinhos tremendo?, perguntou.Jaqueline passou a dar mais Sabril para o filho; meio comprimido tr√™s vezes por dia em vez de duas. Ap√≥s uma crise convulsiva que durou tr√™s horas, ela aumentou a dose para quatro vezes. Eventualmente, Daniel ficou sem o medicamento.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu tive uma sensa√ß√£o horr√≠vel‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ele tinha que tomar o medicamento de todo jeito‚<U+0080>ù.Jaqueline ligou para os policiais, mas eles n√£o conseguiram dinheiro suficiente. Ela mandou mensagens para 319 m√£es do grupo U.M.A. no WhatsApp. As horas passavam. Ningu√©m tinha um comprimido extra de Sabril.Desesperada, ela telefonou para o ex-marido no neg√≥cio de gesso dele, exigindo a pens√£o aliment√≠cia que devia.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Se eu tivesse o dinheiro, j√° tinha dado pra voc√™,‚<U+0080>ù ele falou.Douglas pegou o cart√£o de cr√©dito da m√£e emprestado e foi a cinco farm√°cias antes de encontrar o Sabril. Jaqueline, vestindo uma camiseta cor turquesa da U.M.A. que dizia ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Microcefalia, n√£o √© o fim‚<U+0080>ù, fez com que ele passasse o rem√©dio atrav√©s das grades da janela da sua casa verde.Pouco tempo depois, o governo, concluindo que Jaqueline estava apta para trabalhar, suspendeu o benef√≠cio aos portadores de c√¢ncer que ela recebia. Mas ela se sentiu incapaz de lidar com um emprego. Atualmente, ela recebe o seguro-desemprego e vai solicitar a ajuda do governo para crian√ßas com zika.O pai de Daniel retomou o pagamento da pens√£o aliment√≠cia e aumentou o valor. Jaqueline agora permite que ele veja o filho.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu ainda pe√ßo a Deus para que ele possa ser uma crian√ßa saud√°vel e perfeita‚<U+0080>ù, disse ele. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu continuo pedindo, pedindo, pedindo‚<U+0080>ù.Na tarde seguinte √† crise da falta de medicamento, enquanto examinava os ultrassons da gravidez que mostravam o cr√¢nio subdesenvolvido de Daniel, Jaqueline encontrou uma foto dele sorrindo. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Adoro esse sorriso‚<U+0080>ù, comentou ela. Por causa de Daniel, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>eu sou um ser humano melhor‚<U+0080>ù, ela disse, acrescentando que ‚<U+0080><U+009C>se eu tivesse um beb√™ normal, eu n√£o teria dado tanta aten√ß√£o‚<U+0080>ù.Ela preocupa-se por n√£o se concentrar o suficiente no seu filho de 5 anos, Jo√£o Pedro. Mesmo quando caminha com ele da casa para a escola, ela carrega Daniel, protegendo-o do sol com uma sombrinha turquesa. Um dia, Jo√£o Pedro cobriu o rosto de Daniel com a m√£o, e repetiu v√°rias cantando: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Voc√™ est√° sorrindo?‚<U+0080>ù Como Daniel n√£o respondeu, Jo√£o Pedro correu para um parquinho com brinquedos enferrujados e pendurou-se nas barras.Em outra ocasi√£o, quando sua neurologista, Dra. Maria Durce Costa Gomes Carvalho, encaixou uma consulta para Daniel em sua agenda lotada, o sorriso raro dele ainda estava ausente. Ele chorou e chorou. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Olhe para essa malcria√ß√£o, Daniel! Oh, meu Deus!‚<U+0080>ù, exclamou a Dra. Durce.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ele n√£o costumava ser assim,‚<U+0080>ù disse Jaqueline.Dra. Durce perguntou se Daniel olhava para as coisas.‚<U+0080><U+009C>N√£o muito,‚<U+0080>ù respondeu Jaqueline.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mesmo com os √≥culos?‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>N√£o.‚<U+0080>ùA dosagem da medica√ß√£o de Daniel foi ajustada, o que reduziu as convuls√µes. A Dra. Durce n√£o p√¥de prever se ele iria andar ou falar. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>O que importa, n√©, Jaqueline?, √© cada conquista dele.‚<U+0080>ùJaqueline suspirou. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Eu n√£o posso esperar‚<U+0080>ù, disse ela, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>at√© que ele caia da cama‚<U+0080>ù.Nuvens macias pairavam sobre a Praia Maria Farinha. Era um domingo de manh√£ e vendedores passavam entre os coqueiros vendendo ovos de codorna.Jaqueline passou a m√£o de Daniel na areia macia e cor de argila, numa tentativa de estimular seu tato. Ela apoiava o torso r√≠gido do filho enquanto a cabecinha dele se inclinava para frente. Menos de uma semana ap√≥s a ida ao sal√£o de beleza, os cabelos da m√£e tinham retomado os cachos. Ela parecia cansada.Jaqueline levou o filho para a √°gua cheia de crian√ßas brincando. Ela o submergiu no oceano, o levantou sobre uma onda, balan√ßou Daniel para o alto e o mergulhou outra vez.Margaux Naomi Pierre, a daughter of Jeffri Anne Pierre and Simon C. Pierre of Columbia, Md., was married May 7 to Jordan Vincent Jones, a son of Jeanie Jordan Jones and Juan Jones of Sugar Land, Tex. The Rev. Donald A.

The results of the investigation highlighted the unsafe conditions of many propane tankers. The city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chief prosecutor, Rodolfo Rios, said Monday that two bolts on the truck had cracked, allowing a gasket to blow out partially. The subsequent leak set off an explosion and fire that killed five people, injured dozens and destroyed most of the Hospital Materno Infantil Cuajimalpa. Mr. Rios also noted that one bolt was the wrong size, and that the truck‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meter had been altered to shortchange customers. Experts said wire and Teflon tape had been improperly used on parts of the truck‚<U+0080><U+0099>s valves.SAN SALVADOR ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ¬øCu√°ndo, en la historia de la humanidad, una epidemia se ha vuelto tan alarmante que un pa√≠s ha sentido la necesidad de pedirle a su gente que no tenga hijos durante dos a√±os?Eso es precisamente lo que El Salvador est√° haciendo para luchar contra un virus transmitido por un mosquito y vinculado con el da√±o cerebral infantil; le aconseja a todas las mujeres del pa√≠s que no se queden embarazadas hasta el 2018: para muchos aqu√≠, se trata de un recurso de √∫ltima hora que solo ilustra la desesperaci√≥n del gobierno.Vanessa Iraheta, de 30 a√±os, espera su segundo hijo. Est√° embarazada de siete meses. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No depende del gobierno; depende de Dios. No creo que los j√≥venes dejen de tener hijos‚<U+0080>ù.El virus, conocido como Zika, ha sacudido Latinoam√©rica y el Caribe, particularmente Brasil, donde m√°s de un mill√≥n de personas ya se han contagiado y cerca de 4000 ni√±os han nacido con microcefalia, una enfermedad que provoca que los beb√©s tengan cabezas inusualmente peque√±as.Otros pa√≠ses de la regi√≥n han emitido alertas similares a la de El Salvador; las autoridades colombianas y ecuatorianas tambi√©n han pedido a las mujeres que posterguen sus planes para quedarse embarazadas al menos unos meses, hasta que los peligros del virus se entiendan mejor.Es probable que el virus de Zika, originado por un mosquito y vinculado al da√±o cerebral infantil en Brasil, se extienda por la mayor√≠a de los pa√≠ses del continente americano seg√∫n anunci√≥ la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud el lunes.Pero que El Salvador haya aconsejado dejar de tener ni√±os durante dos a√±os es algo que le ha parecido especialmente radical a muchos expertos que se preguntan ahora sobre otros casos en los que un pa√≠s haya intentado detener su √≠ndice de natalidad para enfrentarse a una epidemia.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Puedo decirles que jam√°s he le√≠do, escuchado o encontrado una petici√≥n p√∫blica como esa‚<U+0080>ù, dijo David Bloom, profesor de econom√≠a y demograf√≠a en la Harvard School of Public Health.Seg√∫n algunos analistas, si el consejo de El Salvador suena a grito de ayuda, es porque lo es.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Qu√© in√∫til es decir algo as√≠‚<U+0080>ù, dijo el Dr. Ernesto Selva Sutter, un destacado experto en salud p√∫blica en El Salvador. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>¬øVan a dejar de tener sexo?‚<U+0080>ùEste peque√±o pa√≠s ya sufre de una epidemia de violencia generada por las pandillas, responsables de que miles de j√≥venes abandonen el pa√≠s rumbo al norte cada a√±o y de que el gobierno se sienta continuamente bajo presi√≥n. El Salvador ya se ha ganado el nada envidiable t√≠tulo de ser el pa√≠s m√°s violento del hemisferio occidental.Y ahora el virus de Zika irrumpe en la realidad. Tras diagnosticarse 5000 casos en un pa√≠s de seis millones de habitantes (m√°s de 1500 solo el mes pasado), el gobierno ha estado buscado soluciones. Ha enviado equipos de fumigadores y potabilizado las redes de conducci√≥n de agua para combatir al mosquito Aedes, que tambi√©n propaga enfermedades como el dengue, la fiebre amarilla o el chikungunya.Un l√≠der vecinal dijo que la cl√≠nica de salud p√∫blica de su colonia cerr√≥ hace tres meses debido a las amenazas de las pandillas, uno de los factores que, seg√∫n los expertos, hace m√°s dif√≠cil tratar y combatir el virus.El viceministro de salud de El Salvador, el Dr. Eduardo Espinoza, dijo que la recomendaci√≥n de dejar de tener hijos no es la primera opci√≥n del gobierno para enfrentarse a la epidemia. La considera, m√°s bien, una estrategia ‚<U+0080><U+009C>secundaria‚<U+0080>ù derivada del ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hecho de que estos mosquitos existen y transmiten esa enfermedad‚<U+0080>ù.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Nos sentimos obligados a hacer esta recomendaci√≥n a las parejas que intentan embarazarse‚<U+0080>ù, agreg√≥.La Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud dijo que no recomendar√≠a suspender los embarazos durante dos a√±os.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hay muchas preguntas a las que responder antes de emitir esa recomendaci√≥n‚<U+0080>ù, coment√≥ el Dr. Marcos Espinal, director de enfermedades contagiosas de la Organizaci√≥n Panamericana de la Salud.Una de las m√°s importantes, dijo, es saber si el pa√≠s ya ha alcanzado el punto m√°ximo de la epidemia. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Se tiene que evaluar el riesgo de emitir una recomendaci√≥n as√≠ para saber c√≥mo impactar√° la tasa de natalidad del pa√≠s‚<U+0080>ù, enfatiz√≥.Otros expertos dijeron que el zika ha situado a pa√≠ses como El Salvador a una situaci√≥n ante la que no sabe c√≥mo actuar.Howard Markel, profesor de historia de la medicina en la Universidad de Michigan, dijo ‚<U+0080><U+009C>nunca he visto o le√≠do que ninguna instancia gubernamental advierta a sus ciudadanos que no se embaracen‚<U+0080>ù.Markel se refiri√≥ a otros consejos m√©dicos relacionados con el embarazo: se advierte a las mujeres que se alejen de cualquier personas con rubeola, por ejemplo, porque puede ser la causa de defectos de nacimiento devastadores, entre ellos la microcefalia.Tambi√©n explic√≥ que cuando comenz√≥ a extenderse el VIH ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hab√≠a un debate silencioso acerca de si era moralmente √©tico que un doctor le aconsejara a una mujer no embarazarse debido al riesgo en el que pondr√≠a a su hijo‚<U+0080>ù. A√∫n no exist√≠a tratamiento y con frecuencia las madres transmit√≠an el virus a sus beb√©s. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pero nadie dijo: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Est√° prohibido; no lo hagan‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù.La recomendaci√≥n gubernamental de posponer los embarazos es una cuesti√≥n delicada en este pa√≠s, conservador y religioso. Requerir√≠a el uso extendido de anticonceptivos, algo complicado en un lugar donde m√°s del 50 por ciento de los ciudadanos son cat√≥licos.Espinoza, el viceministro de salud, dijo que el gobierno no ha debatido espec√≠ficamente sobre la petici√≥n de que las mujeres se abstengan de tener hijos. Sin embargo, le ha pedido a varios l√≠deres religiosos que convenzan a sus fieles para que limpien el agua estancada y recojan la basura, usen repelente y tomen medidas preventivas.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Aunque los l√≠deres religiosos puedan ayudarnos a combatir estos mosquitos, a√∫n nos sentimos obligados a emitir esta recomendaci√≥n a las parejas‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Espinoza, refiri√©ndose al consejo de evitar los embarazos.Al igual que el gobierno, tampoco parece que la Iglesia Cat√≥lica en El Salvador est√© preparada para un conflicto sobre este tema. El arzobispo todav√≠a no ha dado su opini√≥n. Muchos esperaban que aludiera al tema este fin de semana, pero no pudo oficiar la misa del domingo porque estuvo enfermo. El arzobispo auxiliar, Gregorio Rosa Ch√°vez, anunci√≥ que se celebrar√≠a una reuni√≥n de arzobispos la semana que viene que podr√≠a ofrecer algunas respuestas.‚<U+0080><U+009C>En efecto, este es un tema nuevo y debe considerarse con calma‚<U+0080>ù, dijo en una entrevista. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Creo que la iglesia se tomar√° esto muy en serio. Yo solo esperar√≠a un poco‚<U+0080>ù.Esperar no parece ser un problema para algunas mujeres. A diferencia del √≠ndice de natalidad en muchos pa√≠ses en desarrollo, el de El Salvador ya es bajo, y el miedo de que el zika infecte a un ni√±o ya ha sido citado como la tercera o cuarta raz√≥n por la que muchas mujeres no deseaban un embarazo.La primera raz√≥n, dicen, es la violencia. Las pandillas operan con impunidad, y la guerra entre ellas y contra la polic√≠a ha causado niveles de homicidios que no se conoc√≠an desde la guerra civil del pa√≠s, que termin√≥ en 1992.Las mujeres tambi√©n mencionan problemas como la mala situaci√≥n econ√≥mica, una tasa de desempleo y subempleo muy alta o que m√°s de un tercio de la poblaci√≥n vive por debajo de la l√≠nea de la pobreza.‚<U+0080><U+009C>No es por esta enfermedad‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Sara Gald√°mez, de 21 a√±os, acompa√±ada por su hija de 3 a√±os y su esposo. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Honestamente, es una cuesti√≥n econ√≥mica y de inseguridad‚<U+0080>ù.A pesar de la influencia de la iglesia, los anticonceptivos no parecen estar estigmatizados en El Salvador. Datos del gobierno estadounidense sugieren que su uso es similar al de los Estados Unidos.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Las personas van a estar juntas sin importar ninguna enfermedad‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Daniella Hern√°ndez, de 17 a√±os, al lado de su novio. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pero hay otras formas de evitar los embarazos‚<U+0080>ù.Otros se√±alan teor√≠as de la conspiraci√≥n. Ver√≥nica Vel√°squez sugiri√≥ que la recomendaci√≥n del gobierno para que la gente no tenga hijos es, en realidad, un intento para detener el crecimiento de la poblaci√≥n. El Salvador ya est√° tan poblado que sus gobernantes podr√≠an tratar de disminuir el n√∫mero de habitantes, argument√≥ Vel√°squez.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Este gobierno no quiere a nadie m√°s‚<U+0080>ù, dijo con una carcajada. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>¬°Ya no cabemos!‚<U+0080>ùEl gobierno ha hecho todo lo posible por advertir sobre el virus, su impacto potencial y c√≥mo evitarlo. Pero cuando se han pedido explicaciones sobre las consecuencias que tendr√≠a el hecho de que ning√∫n ni√±o naciera en el pa√≠s en los pr√≥ximos dos a√±os, el viceministro de salud reconoci√≥ que no ser√≠a el peor escenario.‚<U+0080><U+009C>El Salvador es el pa√≠s con m√°s densidad demogr√°fica en todo el continente‚<U+0080>ù, dijo durante una conferencia de prensa. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No estar√≠a tan mal que hubiese una disminuci√≥n en los nacimientos‚<U+0080>ù.LUCKNOW, India ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ¬øQu√© pasar√≠a si alguien descubriera un remedio capaz de salvar la vida de m√°s ni√±os en el mundo en desarrollo que los que mueren por malaria y SIDA combinados?¬øUna sustancia milagrosa para reducir las infecciones de o√≠do, que tambi√©n podr√≠a aumentar varios puntos en las pruebas de coeficiente intelectual? ¬øUna sustancia que puede estar disponible incluso en las poblaciones m√°s remotas y no requiere electricidad ni refrigeraci√≥n? Ah, y ya que estamos so√±ando, ojal√° que tambi√©n sea gratis.Esta sustancia milagrosa ya existe; es la leche materna.C√°lculos actuales con el respaldo de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud y Unicef indican que la lactancia materna podr√≠a salvar la vida de 800.000 ni√±os al a√±o en pa√≠ses en desarrollo. Esta cifra equivale a una reducci√≥n del 12 por ciento en la mortalidad infantil, sin duda una ganancia inmensa.Hace poco complet√© mi viaje anual en el que un estudiante me acompa√±a a un √°rea del mundo en desarrollo para observar problemas que no han recibido atenci√≥n. Con mi estudiante, Austin Meyer de la Universidad de Stanford, he estudiado India, donde 1,2 millones de ni√±os menores de 5 a√±os mueren cada a√±o y donde los nutricionistas afirman que mejorar las pr√°cticas de lactancia materna podr√≠an salvar muchas vidas.La lactancia materna exclusiva por seis meses, que la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud recomienda enf√°ticamente, es una pr√°ctica que s√≥lo ha adoptado el 46 por ciento de las mujeres en India, el 17 por ciento en Nigeria, y el 10 por ciento en Yemen, seg√∫n el Global Nutrition Report m√°s reciente. (En Estados Unidos, esta cifra es de aproximadamente 22 por ciento, seg√∫n los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci√≥n de Enfermedades.)Voy a decir esto de frente: es extra√±o que los hombres promovamos la lactancia materna, e incluso puede sonar un tanto condescendiente pues el trabajo les toca a las mujeres.Tambi√©n voy a decir esto: algunas veces promover la lactancia materna, por desgracia, puede entenderse como un reproche hacia las mujeres que no pueden amamantar o deciden no hacerlo, lo cual resulta contraproducente. En Estados Unidos, estos temas producen tensi√≥n; un ensayo que apareci√≥ en el Times hace unas semanas advierte que las acciones para promover la lactancia pueden convertirse en causas de un sentimiento de verguenza entre las mujeres. Es una advertencia razonable.En cualquier caso, este tema no es de vida o muerte en Occidente sino en los pa√≠ses en desarrollo, donde con frecuencia el agua est√° contaminada y existe una mortalidad infantil elevada.Los ni√±os que no son amamantados tienen una posibilidad 14 veces mayor de morir que aquellos que s√≥lo reciben lactancia materna, de acuerdo con un gran metaestudio que public√≥ hace poco Acta Paediatrica, una revista pedi√°trica.En esta regi√≥n del norte de la India, Austin y yo conocimos a una madre, Maher Bano, que hab√≠a dado a luz unas cuantas horas antes en su casa. La beb√© no ten√≠a peso suficiente y corr√≠a el peligro de morir. En este contexto, el mejor medicamento es la leche materna: estudios realizados en India, Nepal y Ghana muestran que amamantar de inmediato reduce la mortalidad neonatal en un 44 por ciento.Pero Maher Bano dijo que en las primeras 24 horas, la beb√© recibir√≠a √∫nicamente t√© con miel.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ma√±ana amamantar√© a la beb√©, o quiz√°s un d√≠a despu√©s‚<U+0080>ù, se√±al√≥, y explic√≥ que segu√≠a las indicaciones de la partera tradicional. Se trata de una pr√°ctica com√∫n: en todo el mundo, s√≥lo el 43 por ciento de los beb√©s reciben el seno materno en la primera hora de vida, como recomienda la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud.Uno de los motivos por los que se retrasa este contacto es que existe cierto recelo ante el calostro, la primera leche materna, de tono amarillento, que no parece leche pero contiene muchos nutrientes y anticuerpos; algunas veces se refiere a esta leche como la ‚<U+0080><U+009C>primera vacuna‚<U+0080>ù.Otro gran reto es que en los pa√≠ses de clima caliente, los habitantes con frecuencia tambi√©n dan agua a los ni√±os cuando hace calor, o les dan alimentos antes de que cumplan los seis meses. El agua no s√≥lo reemplaza a la leche, sino que muchas veces est√° contaminada. (La leche materna, por el contrario, es segura aunque la mam√° beba agua contaminada).Las compa√±√≠as occidentales tambi√©n son responsables. Los fabricantes de f√≥rmulas para beb√©s no registran crecimiento en los pa√≠ses occidentales, por lo que en√©rgicamente dirigen campa√±as a los pa√≠ses m√°s pobres. Algunas investigaciones revelaron que el 85 por ciento de las madres que acababan de dar a luz en Phnom Penh, Camboya, ya hab√≠an visto anuncios de f√≥rmulas.Algunos tambi√©n creen que los programas de entretenimiento occidentales han sexualizado a los senos de tal forma que la lactancia materna ha quedado reducida.Aunque los beneficios m√°s claros de la lactancia se relacionan con salvar vidas, tambi√©n existen otros beneficios cognitivos y de salud. En Bielorrusia, los hijos de mujeres seleccionadas de manera aleatoria en proyectos para promover la lactancia materna exclusiva obtuvieron seis puntos m√°s en pruebas de coeficiente intelectual que el grupo de control.Contados estudios no han descubierto una relaci√≥n con la capacidad cognitiva, pero la mayor√≠a s√≠ ha revelado dicha relaci√≥n. En general, un nuevo an√°lisis de 17 estudios determin√≥ una mejora promedio de tres puntos de coeficiente intelectual entre los ni√±os amamantados.Algunos expertos en salud global se concentran en la lactancia materna en parte porque es posible ver resultados r√°pidamente. Un estudio reciente de Acta Paediatrica que incluy√≥ 130 c√°lculos revel√≥ que acciones de promoci√≥n produjeron un impresionante aumento promedio en la lactancia materna exclusiva del 44 por ciento.Mi viaje anual es una oportunidad para enfatizar soluciones a problemas globales. Algunas veces estas soluciones involucran tecnolog√≠a deslumbrante; pero casi nada tiene la capacidad de salvar tantas vidas infantiles al a√±o como el propio milagro de la naturaleza: la leche materna.Sigue a NYT Am√©rica en Facebook y Twitter para leer m√°s art√≠culos de The New York Times en espa√±ol.LOS ANGELES ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No s√©, hermano. Estaba mal de la cabeza‚<U+0080>ù.Hace poco, M. Night Shyamalan pronunci√≥ estas palabras, mientras pensaba sobre por qu√© algunas veces fracasan sus decisiones de carrera, y luego solt√≥ una risita. Estaba bromeando, pero la ternura en sus ojos lo traicion√≥: Hab√≠a algo de verdad en esa frase.En comparaci√≥n con sus primeras cuatro pel√≠culas de estudio, todas importantes √©xitos, empezando con ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Sixth Sense‚<U+0080>ù en 1999, las √∫ltimas cuatro pel√≠culas de Shyamalan han sido una serie de fracasos. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lady in the Water‚<U+0080>ù, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Happening‚<U+0080>ù, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Last Airbender‚<U+0080>ù y ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After Earth‚<U+0080>ù empa√±aron de manera importante su reputaci√≥n entre los amantes del cine. El tipo que nos trajo esa chatarra ‚<U+0080><U+0094> y s√≠, claro, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Sixth Sense‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ¬øquiere que compremos boletos otra vez?No, gracias.Pero hay un giro que nadie se esperaba: Shyamalan, de 45 a√±os, visiblemente m√°s sencillo y maduro, analiz√≥ con dureza su vida profesional y cambi√≥ de rumbo. El resultado es ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù, una comedia de suspenso poco convencional que bien podr√≠a significar su regreso triunfal a las salas de cine, o por lo menos ser un comienzo.Despu√©s de recibir una paliza hace dos a√±os por ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After Earth‚<U+0080>ù, una aventura espacial entre un padre y su hijo protagonizada por un padre e hijo en la vida real, Will y Jaden Smith, Shyamalan decidi√≥ probar suerte en la televisi√≥n. Fue parte del equipo detr√°s de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Wayward Pines‚<U+0080>ù, una serie de misterio de Fox que cautiv√≥ a los televidentes (aunque no a todos los cr√≠ticos) este verano con su excentricidad. La segunda temporada ya est√° en camino.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Como en la televisi√≥n hay menos recursos, descubr√≠ c√∫anto peso extra hab√≠a acumulado, y muchos malos h√°bitos que me hab√≠an malcriado‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Shyamalan, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>tuve esta maravillosa sensaci√≥n de estarme deshaciendo poco a poco de todo ese peso‚<U+0080>ù (Donald De Line, productor ejecutivo de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Wayward Pines‚<U+0080>ù, dijo que Shyamalan se mostr√≥ ‚<U+0080><U+009C>positivo, lleno de energ√≠a y cooperativo‚<U+0080>ù y ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ni remotamente‚<U+0080>ù imperioso, como sostienen algunos ejecutivos de estudios).En el terreno del cine, Shyamalan dio un giro radical pues se alej√≥ de proyectos complicados como ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Airbender‚<U+0080>ù y ‚<U+0080><U+009C>After Earth‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> pel√≠culas que, a diferencia de sus primeros √©xitos ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Signs‚<U+0080>ù, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Village‚<U+0080>ù, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unbreakable‚<U+0080>ù, no estaban basadas en sus propios guiones. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù, que escribi√≥, produjo y dirigi√≥, llegar√° a las salas de cine en los pr√≥ximos meses. Adem√°s, Shyamalan invirti√≥ cerca de $5 millones de su propio capital en la pel√≠cula.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Tal vez eso fue bien est√∫pido‚<U+0080>ù, dijo durante una entrevista en el Hotel Bel-Air, mientras daba sorbos a su vino blanco y com√≠a un tartare de at√∫n. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Pero eso aument√≥ el factor de riesgo. S√≥lo hab√≠a una forma de salir de esto. Ten√≠a que hacer una gran pel√≠cula. S√≥lo ten√≠a que funcionar‚<U+0080>ù.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù, que incluye uno de los finales sorpresa caracter√≠sticos de Shyamalan, narra la historia de dos adolescentes que visitan a sus abuelos, quienes se comportan de manera muy extra√±a; la abuela, interpretada por Deanna Dunagan, ara√±a las paredes cada noche, y el abuelo (Peter McRobbie) oculta un extra√±o secreto en el cobertizo, entre otros lugares. La pel√≠cula ha sido un √©xito inesperado entre la audiencia de prueba.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Admito que ten√≠a mis dudas antes de entrar‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Alexa Hernandez, quien vio ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù en julio como asistente a Comic-Con International en San Diego, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>pero fue una de las mejores pel√≠culas de terror que he visto. Y fue divertida‚<U+0080>ù. Despu√©s de una exhibici√≥n previa de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù en julio, William Bibbiani, cr√≠tico de CraveOnline, escribi√≥ en Twitter: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>La mejor pel√≠cula de M. Night Shyamalan en mucho, mucho, pero MUCHO tiempo‚<U+0080>ù.As√≠ como Shyamalan ha aprendido a las malas, ser un autor/director ‚<U+0080><U+0094> proyectar lo que est√° en tu mente, sin que importen las corrientes culturales y las ventas de boletos ‚<U+0080><U+0094> es tal vez el camino m√°s truculento de Hollywood. Se puede hacer, pero por lo general conduce a periodos improductivos en las taquillas. Woody Allen tal vez sea el mejor ejemplo: fiel a su estilo trabaja fuera del sistema de los estudios, y puede contar o no con el favor del p√∫blico.Sentado con las piernas cruzadas en una banca del patio del hotel, Shyamalan habl√≥ con franqueza sobre haber sido prisionero de su propia mente. Insisti√≥ en que hab√≠a aprendido de sus errores, e hizo una comparaci√≥n con la nueva biograf√≠a de David McCullough sobre los Hermanos Wright, que curiosamente tra√≠a encima.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Los cientos de fracasos que vivieron, no fueron fracasos para ellos‚<U+0080>ù, dijo. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ellos sufr√≠an un descalabro y luego sol√≠an decir: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Fue maravilloso. Ya s√© qu√© sali√≥ mal‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù.Shyamalan no reniega de ninguno de sus proyectos anteriores. Coment√≥ que ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Lady in the Water‚<U+0080>ù, la cual perdi√≥ dinero en 2006 y cuya producci√≥n qued√≥ tristemente registrada en el libro ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Man Who Heard Voices‚<U+0080>ù de Michael Bamberger, sigue siendo una de sus favoritas. Sin embargo, Shyamalan acept√≥ que ahora estaba concentrado en hacer realidad su visi√≥n, mientras que su √©nfasis en el p√∫blico pas√≥ a segundo plano.‚<U+0080><U+009C>No me di cuenta de que el punto √≥ptimo de entretenimiento hab√≠a cambiado de lugar‚<U+0080>ù, dijo. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hace un tiempo, David Fincher y Christopher Nolan estaban en un extremo, apenas tratando de sobrevivir. Eran demasiado sombr√≠os y oscuros. Y ahora est√°n en el centro. Mientras tanto, yo hac√≠a proyectos sentimentales. ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Airbender‚<U+0080><U+0099> se bas√≥ en un programa infantil apto para el p√∫blico general. ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Lady in the Water‚<U+0080><U+0099> comenz√≥ como un cuento para dormir que les relataba a mis hijas‚<U+0080>ù.Y sigui√≥: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Para m√≠, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>E. T.‚<U+0080><U+0099> siempre fue el santo grial. Ten√≠a 13 a√±os cuando vi esa pel√≠cula y termin√© llorando en el cine. Hab√≠a otros chicos de 13 a√±os tambi√©n llorando en el cine. ¬øConoces a chicos de esa misma edad que har√≠an eso ahora? La era en la que crec√≠ fue una √©poca c√°lida y sentimental. Ese p√∫blico ya no existe. Mi hija va a pasar directo de Pixar a Seth Rogen‚<U+0080>ù.Al igual que algunas de las pel√≠culas anteriores de Shyamalan, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù es un drama familiar √≠ntimo insertado en una pel√≠cula de terror. Recurre a una t√©cnica de filmaci√≥n muy com√∫n (si bien nueva para √©l) conocida como metraje encontrado o falso documental; uno de los personajes, en este caso una adolescente, capta la acci√≥n con una c√°mara.El gui√≥n de Shyamalan trata de mantener al p√∫blico adivinando en m√°s de una forma. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No se trataba s√≥lo del giro‚<U+0080>ù, dijo, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>en los momentos de comedia negra, quer√≠a que la gente se preguntara: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>¬øSe supone que me r√≠a o que sienta shock? No tengo idea, pero me gusta‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù (est√©n atentos a la extra√±a escena con un pa√±al sucio).Al final de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Visit‚<U+0080>ù, la adolescente ‚<U+0080><U+0094> quien aspira a ser cineasta (lo que explica por qu√© graba todo, todo el tiempo) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ha cambiado su estilo de principiante a uno mucho m√°s relajado, que tal vez refleja la reciente transici√≥n de Shyamalan.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Al principio, ella se esforzaba tanto por hacer algo bello y art√≠stico‚<U+0080>ù, coment√≥ el cineasta, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>y al final dice: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>¬øSabes qu√©? Mejor s√≥lo vamos a divertirnos‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù.El 11 de septiembre, al atardecer, un muelle con vista a la zona cero en Downtown Manhattan se convirti√≥ en el equivalente moderno de ‚<U+0080><U+009C>La Dolce Vita‚<U+0080>ù; era el debut del director creativo de Givenchy, Riccardo Tisci, en la Semana de la Moda de Nueva York.La esencia del desfile gir√≥ en torno a la religi√≥n y el legado de los ataques del 2001. Pero este tipo de mensajes pueden verse eclipsados cuando la espera por la llegada de Kanye West y Kim Kardashian demora el comienzo en m√°s de una hora.Nicki Minaj estaba ah√≠, luciendo como una encarnaci√≥n de Jessica Rabbit en su vestido de leopardo. Muy cerca estaba Julia Roberts, m√°s discreta, con un esmoquin de pantal√≥n negro y una gota de delineador. M√°s atr√°s estaban Christina Ricci, Courtney Love, Deborah Harry y Amanda Seyfried. Hasta Pedro Almod√≥var, quien viaj√≥ desde Madrid, estaba presente.Durante la √∫ltima d√©cada, Tisci se ha convertido en el dise√±ador de modas m√°s conectado de su generaci√≥n, un hombre cuyos tent√°culos se extienden desde los nominados al Oscar hasta los participantes de realities, desde artistas cotizados hasta promotores de la vida nocturna gay, y desde modelos que apenas superan la edad legal hasta se√±oras de alta sociedad con rastros de cirug√≠as.Este compromiso con la diversidad es tal vez uno de los factores que lo han impulsado a la cima de su industria, no solo entre la multitud de editores y fashionistas, sino tambi√©n entre una base de fan√°ticos multicultural.Jay Z y Beyonc√© est√°n entre los favoritos en su tel√©fono (y estuvieron en su mesa en la Gala del Metropolitan Museum). Tambi√©n estan los amigos con los que se escapa de vacaciones como Madonna y Kate Moss, colaboradores corporativos como Nike (que recientemente contrat√≥ a Tisci para dise√±ar una l√≠nea de zapatos) y un sonriente jefe llamado Bernard Arnault, presidente del conglomerado de moda LVMH, quien estaba sentado en la primera fila del desfile, aparentemente complacido ante la concurrencia estelar.Tras bastidores estaba Marina Abramovic, la directora art√≠stica del evento, un esfuerzo que seg√∫n ella le tom√≥ seis meses (aquellos en la audiencia familiarizados con el costo de estas producciones dijeron que muy probablemente fuera uno de los desfiles de moda m√°s costosos en la historia de Nueva York).Pero ¬øc√≥mo hizo este hombre de 41 a√±os, de ojos oscuros profundos, cabello negro corto, acento italiano marcado, y un discreto uniforme de camisetas negras, shorts negros y zapatos negros, para ganarse a los m√°s glamurosos?Naci√≥ el 1ero de agosto de 1974 en Taranto, una ciudad costera en el sur de Italia. Era el √∫nico var√≥n de una familia mediterr√°nea sin dinero, y el m√°s peque√±o de nueve hijos. Cuando ten√≠a seis a√±os, su padre muri√≥ de un ataque cardiaco, pero a nadie en su casa le falt√≥ amor.Sus hermanas son asistentes fieles a sus desfiles. Tambi√©n lo era su madre, quien asisti√≥ a cada uno de los eventos de Givenchy hasta hace muy poco, cuando empez√≥ a sentirse m√°s fr√°gil. Cuando no puede estar ah√≠ (como en Nueva York), lo llama a su celular para preguntarle si comi√≥, si durmi√≥, si est√° solo.En la escuela, Tisci era un outsider, el t√≠pico chico que adoraba a √≠conos g√≥ticos como Robert Smith y Siouxsie Sioux y estaba lo suficientemente consciente de s√≠ mismo para empezar a planear su escape del sur de Italia.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sab√≠a que si me quedaba ah√≠, ser√≠a pobre para siempre‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Tisci en junio, sentado en un sof√° Le Corbusier en las oficinas de Givenchy en Par√≠s, donde estaba fumando un cigarrillo frente a un gran cactus. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mi mam√° dijo: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Vete. Estoy segura de que regresar√°s m√°s feliz y m√°s fuerte‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù.A los 17 a√±os se fue para Londres. Ah√≠, trabaj√≥ como empleado en un hotel mientras pasaba el tiempo en clubes gay como Trade, DTPM y Orange. Se convirti√≥ en asistente del dise√±ador Antonio Berardi, lo cual condujo a una beca del gobierno que permiti√≥ a Tisci entrar a Central Saint Martins, la escuela de modas m√°s prestigiosa de Londres.Como ya ten√≠a experiencia, Tisci pudo saltarse el primer a√±o, pero eso solo llevo a que los dem√°s estudiantes lo trataran como un intruso. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Era el m√°s odiado‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Tisci, cuyo ingl√©s con fuerte acento a menudo es demasiado r√°pido. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Destrozaron mi locker. Fue como: ‚<U+0080><U+0098>¬°Bienvenido a la industria de la moda!‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùPoco despu√©s, Tisci obtuvo un puesto en Ruffo Research, una marca italiana que previamente hab√≠a dado sus primeros empleos a futuras estrellas del dise√±o, como Nicolas Ghesqui√®re y Sophia Kokosalaki. La empresa quebr√≥ antes de la primera exposici√≥n de Tisci.En 2005, tras la salida de Julien Macdonald, fue contratado por Givenchy. Aunque era una casa ilustre fundada en 1952 por Hubert de Givenchy, quien gan√≥ fama vistiendo a Audrey Hepburn y Jacqueline Kennedy, hab√≠a ca√≠do en tiempos dif√≠ciles.Y Tisci fracas√≥ en grande con su primera colecci√≥n. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Era demasiado g√≥tica‚<U+0080>ù, record√≥ Carine Roitfeld, entonces editora de Paris Vogue, en una conversaci√≥n telef√≥nica. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No fue muy exitosa, pero revel√≥ mucho de √©l. Era evidente que ten√≠a talento‚<U+0080>ù.R√°pidamente entendi√≥ que las celebridades ser√≠an valiosas para √©l, aunque dice que no las busc√≥ pensando en eso. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No visto a celebridades por el gusto de vestir celebridades‚<U+0080>ù, insisti√≥. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Visto a la gente que me gusta‚<U+0080>ù.Entre las primeras estuvo Courtney Love, quien fue contratada por Tisci para actuar en 2007 en su taller en un vestido blanco de alta costura. Luego, la estilista Arianne Phillips le pidi√≥ a Tisci algunos bosquejos para la gira mundial de 2008 de Madonna, lo cual llev√≥ a una reuni√≥n con la diva, un acuerdo para dise√±ar sus deslumbrantes disfraces negros y, luego, una amistad.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Me acabo de hospedar en su casa en los Hamptons‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Tisci durante una visita en junio.Se hizo amigo de West, quien lo contrat√≥ para dise√±ar la portada de su √°lbum con Jay Z (totalmente dorado, con bordados, muy Givenchy), y luego lo seleccion√≥ para ser codirector de la gira de los raperos.Tisci es el motor de su grupo de amigos. Una celebridad amiga se contacta con Tisci v√≠a otra celebridad conocida, y luego Tisci conecta a los reci√©n llegados con su grupo itinerante y alegre que se la pasan tom√°ndose selfies.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Conoc√≠ a Madonna, conoc√≠ a Alicia Keys, a trav√©s de √©l‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Abramovic. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Cada vez que uno est√° en su mesa, √©l se asegura de que haya modelos, artistas, de todo. Es un im√°n‚<U+0080>ù.Cuando West se relacion√≥ con Kardashian, Tisci la present√≥ con Roitfeld, quien luego puso a Kardashian en la portada de su revista, CR Fashion Book.Una supuesta prohibici√≥n en contra de Kardashian en la prestigiosa Met Gala fue levantada hace dos a√±os cuando Tisci fue el anfitri√≥n junto a la emperatriz suprema del mundo de la moda, Anna Wintour, de Vogue.‚<U+0080><U+009C>En cierta forma‚<U+0080>ù, dijo Wintour, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Riccardo me recuerda a Gianni Versace porque es una persona tan abierta y encantadora que las personas se sienten atra√≠das a √©l‚<U+0080>ù.Hoy en d√≠a, Tisci vive de una manera similar a la de sus amigos m√°s deslumbrantes. La mayor parte del a√±o vive en Par√≠s, en un soleado apartamento que da al Sena, en medio de fotograf√≠as de Cindy Sherman y Robert Mapplethorpe y muebles de Gio Ponti.Cuando no est√° ah√≠, salta por el planeta con su maleta Givenchy llena de camisetas negras y cigarrillos American Spirit amarillos.Cuarenta y un a√±os y mucho √©xito han hecho poco por cambiar el comportamiento infantil de Tisci.Por un lado, a√∫n se muerde las u√±as cuando est√° nervioso. Por otro, no se sienta en una silla sino que se reclina en ella, como si siempre estuviera esperando algo, ya sea cafe√≠na, American Spirits o, m√°s profundamente, la inspiraci√≥n. Es, al mismo tiempo, un ni√±o que recibi√≥ mucho amor de mam√° y un hombre decidido a rebelarse contra eso.Recientemente, han habido rumores de que Tisci podr√≠a estar cerca de algo m√°s grande. Su nombre circul√≥ fuertemente cuando Frida Giannini abandon√≥ Gucci el a√±o pasado, y se habl√≥ mucho durante la semana de la moda de que su exhibici√≥n del 11 de septiembre no era solo una fiesta de aniversario sino quiz√° una despedida.Wintour dice que le gustar√≠a verlo ah√≠ m√°s tiempo . ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Ojal√° haya un poco m√°s estabilidad en la moda‚<U+0080>ù, dijo. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Givenchy es una plataforma grandiosa para √©l‚<U+0080>ù.Tisci est√° de acuerdo.‚<U+0080><U+009C>En 10 a√±os, muchas personas se me han acercado‚<U+0080>ù, dijo. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Cuando logras que una casa tenga √©xito, muchas personas se acercan. Pero siempre rechazo todo porque estoy feliz donde estoy. Quiero concentrarme en Givenchy‚<U+0080>ù.Sigue a NYT Am√©rica en Facebook y Twitter para leer m√°s art√≠culos de The New York Times en espa√±ol.El uso excesivo de juegos de computadora entre j√≥venes chinos parece estar tomando una direcci√≥n alarmante y podr√≠a ser especialmente relevante para padres cuyos hijos pasan muchas horas frente a pantallas electr√≥nicas. El nuevo documental ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Web Junkie‚<U+0080>ù, que se estrenar√° pronto, revela los tr√°gicos efectos que sufren los adolescentes que no pueden desprenderse de los videojuegos durante muchas horas seguidas, sin siquiera apartarse para dormir, comer o incluso ir al ba√±o. Muchos comienzan a percibir que el mundo real es falso.Los m√©dicos chinos consideran que este fen√≥meno es un trastorno cl√≠nico y han creado centros de rehabilitaci√≥n donde los j√≥venes afectados son internados durante meses, algunas veces bajo terapias draconianas y completamente aislados de elementos electr√≥nicos, aunque a√∫n no se ha demostrado la efectividad de estos tratamientos.Si bien la adicci√≥n a Internet a√∫n no se considera un diagn√≥stico cl√≠nico, no hay duda de que muchos j√≥venes en Estados Unidos y otros pa√≠ses permanecen conectados y alejados de la vida ‚<U+0080><U+009C>real‚<U+0080>ù durante muchas m√°s horas de las que los expertos consideran saludables para su desarrollo normal. Esto comienza en una etapa temprana, a menudo con ni√±os que a√∫n no hablan y se entretienen con los tel√©fonos celulares y tabletas de sus padres en vez de explorar el mundo a su alrededor e interactuar con quienes los rodean.En su declaraci√≥n de 2013 sobre ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Los ni√±os, los adolescentes y los medios de comunicaci√≥n‚<U+0080>ù, la Academia Estadounidense de Pediatr√≠a cit√≥ estas preocupantes estad√≠sticas de un estudio de 2010 de la Kaiser Family Foundation: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Un ni√±o promedio de entre 8 y 10 a√±os pasa cerca de ocho horas diarias frente a distintos elementos electr√≥nicos y esta cantidad asciende a m√°s de 11 horas diarias en ni√±os mayores y adolescentes.‚<U+0080>ù La televisi√≥n, desde hace mucho tiempo una popular ‚<U+0080><U+009C>ni√±era sustituta‚<U+0080>ù, sigue dominando, pero las computadoras, tabletas y celulares la van desplazando gradualmente.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Muchos padres parecen tener muy pocas reglas sobre el uso de los elementos electr√≥nicos por parte de ni√±os y adolescentes‚<U+0080>ù, sostuvo la academia, mientras que las dos terceras partes de los participantes en el estudio admitieron no tener reglas sobre el tiempo que los j√≥venes pasan con los dispositivos.Los padres, que agradecen estas formas para calmar a los ni√±os revoltosos y evitar que interrumpan su propio tiempo con las tabletas y celulares, parecen no advertir los posibles riesgos del tiempo excesivo que pasan en el mundo virtual.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Les damos pantallas a los ni√±os todo el d√≠a, buscando distraerlos en lugar de ense√±arles c√≥mo tranquilizarse, c√≥mo calmarse por s√≠ solos,‚<U+0080>ù dice Catherine Steiner-Adair, psic√≥loga cl√≠nica afiliada a Harvard y autora del √©xito en ventas ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age‚<U+0080>ù (‚<U+0080><U+009C>La gran desconexi√≥n: c√≥mo proteger la infancia y las relaciones familiares en la era digital‚<U+0080>ù).Antes de que cumplan 2 a√±os, los ni√±os no se deben exponer a ning√∫n medio electr√≥nico, seg√∫n la academia de pediatr√≠a, porque ‚<U+0080><U+009C>el cerebro de un ni√±o se desarrolla r√°pidamente durante estos primeros a√±os y los ni√±os peque√±os aprenden mejor si interact√∫an con personas, no con pantallas.‚<U+0080>ù Los ni√±os m√°s grandes y adolescentes pueden pasar no m√°s de una o dos horas al d√≠a con medios de entretenimiento, preferiblemente con contenido de alta calidad, y el resto de su tiempo deber√≠an dedicarlo a jugar al aire libre, leer, practicar un pasatiempo y ‚<U+0080><U+009C>usar su imaginaci√≥n en los juegos‚<U+0080>ù, recomienda la academia.El uso excesivo de medios electr√≥nicos puede tener importantes efectos negativos sobre la conducta, la salud y el rendimiento escolar de los ni√±os. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Quienes miran demasiada violencia simulada, incluida en muchos videojuegos populares, pueden desarrollar inmunidad a la violencia y ser m√°s propensos a actuar de manera violenta, en lugar de forma emp√°tica‚<U+0080>ù, afirma Dimitri A. Christakis del Instituto de Investigaci√≥n Infantil de Seattle.En la elaboraci√≥n de su tesis para la Universidad de Rhode Island, Kristina E. Hatch le pregunt√≥ a varios ni√±os sobre sus videojuegos favoritos. Un ni√±o de cuarto de primaria mencion√≥ el juego ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Call of Duty: Black Ops‚<U+0080>ù porque ‚<U+0080><U+009C>hay zombies y los puedes matar con pistolas y hay mucha violencia‚<U+0080>¶ me gusta la sangre y la violencia.‚<U+0080>ùEl trabajo escolar puede verse afectado cuando el tiempo dedicado al entretenimiento interfiere con la lectura y el estudio. Y la naturaleza sedentaria de la mayor√≠a de las actividades electr√≥nicas ‚<U+0080><U+0094> junto con los avisos comerciales de alimentos altos en calor√≠as ‚<U+0080><U+0094> puede causar el aumento de peso, que ya es una epidemia entre los j√≥venes del pa√≠s.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Si se les permite a los ni√±os jugar ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Candy Crush‚<U+0080><U+0099> mientras van a la escuela, el viaje ser√° silencioso, y esto no es lo que ellos necesitan‚<U+0080>ù, dice el Dr. Steiner-Adair en una entrevista. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Necesitan fantasear, manejar su ansiedad, procesar sus pensamientos y compartirlos con sus padres, quienes pueden brindarles seguridad.‚<U+0080>ùLa tecnolog√≠a es un mal sustituto de la interacci√≥n personal. Cuando est√°n fuera de sus casas, el Dr. Steiner-Adair agrega, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>los ni√±os tienen que saber que la vida es atractiva fuera de la pantalla. Es sano sentir curiosidad por otras personas, aprender a escuchar. Esto les ense√±a sobre la inteligencia social y emocional, indispensables para alcanzar el √©xito en la vida.‚<U+0080>ùLos mensajes de texto amenazan con convertirse en la pr√≥xima epidemia nacional, pues la mitad de los adolescentes env√≠a 50 o m√°s mensajes diarios, y aquellos entre 13 y 17 a√±os env√≠an un promedio de 3364 mensajes por mes, seg√∫n un estudio de 2012 por Amanda Lenhart del Centro de Investigaciones Pew. Un estudio anterior del mismo centro determin√≥ que los adolescentes env√≠an un promedio de 34 mensajes de texto por la noche antes de acostarse, lo que agrava la privaci√≥n del sue√±o. Y, tal como lo manifest√≥ Hath, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a medida que los ni√±os se comunican cada vez m√°s a trav√©s de medios electr√≥nicos, y menos personalmente, comienzan a sentirse m√°s solos y deprimidos.‚<U+0080>ùTambi√©n pueden existir consecuencias f√≠sicas. Los ni√±os pueden sentir dolor en los dedos y mu√±ecas, padecer un estrechamiento de los vasos sangu√≠neos en los ojos (las consecuencias a largo plazo son inciertas) y sufrir dolor de cuello y espalda por inclinarse sobre sus tel√©fonos, tabletas y computadoras.Recy Taylor, a 24-year-old African-American sharecropper, was walking home from church in Abbeville, Ala., on the night of Sept. 3, 1944, when she was abducted and raped by six white men.The crime was extensively covered in the black press and an early catalyst for the civil rights movement. The N.A.A.C.P. sent a young activist from its Montgomery, Ala., chapter named Rosa Parks to investigate. African-Americans around the country demanded that the men be prosecuted.But the attack, like many involving black victims during the Jim Crow era in the South, never went to trial. Two all-white, all-male grand juries refused to indict the men, even though one of them had confessed.Decades passed before the case gained renewed attention, with the publication in 2010 of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a New History of the Civil Rights Movement From Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power,‚<U+0080>ù by the historian Danielle L. McGuire. The book prompted an official apology in 2011 to Mrs. Taylor by the Alabama Legislature, which called the failure to prosecute her attackers ‚<U+0080><U+009C>morally abhorrent and repugnant.‚<U+0080>ùMrs. Taylor died in Abbeville on Thursday, three weeks after the release of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Rape of Recy Taylor,‚<U+0080>ù a documentary about the crime. She was 97. The death was confirmed by her brother, Robert Lee Corbitt.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Many ladies got raped,‚<U+0080>ù Mrs. Taylor said in the film, interviewed by its director, Nancy Buirski. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The peoples there ‚<U+0080><U+0094> they seemed like they wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t concerned about what happened to me, and they didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t try and do nothing about it. I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help but tell the truth of what they done to me.‚<U+0080>ùBorn on Dec. 31, 1919, to a family of sharecroppers in Abbeville, in southeastern Alabama, Recy (pronounced ‚<U+0080><U+009C>REE-see‚<U+0080>ù) Corbitt found herself caring for six younger siblings after their mother died when she was 17.On the night of the attack, she had gone to Rock Hill Holiness Church for a Pentecostal service of singing and praying and was walking home along a country highway bounded by peanut farms. A friend, Fannie Daniel, 61, and Ms. Daniel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 18-year-old son, West, were with her. They noticed a green Chevrolet passing by several times.Eventually the car stopped, and seven young white men, armed with guns and knives, stepped out. One of them, Herbert Lovett, the oldest in the group, ordered the three to halt, and then pointed a shotgun at them when they ignored him.The men forced Mrs. Taylor into the car at gunpoint and drove her to a grove of pine trees on the side of the road, where they forced her to disrobe. She begged to be allowed to go, citing her husband and their 3-year-old daughter. But Mr. Lovett was unmoved. Ordering her to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>act just like you do with your husband or I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll cut your damn throat,‚<U+0080>ù he and five other men raped her. (A seventh young man, Billy Howerton, said later that he did not take part because he knew Mrs. Taylor.)Dumped out of the car, Mrs. Taylor removed her blindfold and stumbled toward safety. Her father, Benny Corbitt, had learned of the abduction and gone searching for her. Soon the county sheriff, George H. Gamble, arrived.Mrs. Taylor told Sheriff Gamble that she could not identify her assailants, but her description of the car matched only one vehicle in the county, that of Hugo Wilson. When the sheriff returned with Mr. Wilson and his father, Mrs. Taylor identified Mr. Wilson as one of her attackers, as did the teenage friend.Questioned at the county jail, Mr. Wilson acknowledged that he and five others ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Mr. Lovett, Dillard York, Luther Lee, Willie Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ‚<U+0080><U+009C>all had intercourse with her,‚<U+0080>ù but insisted that they had paid her and that it was not rape. The sheriff sent Mr. Wilson home.The next evening, Mrs. Taylor faced new threats: White vigilantes set her porch on fire. The following day, she and her husband, Willie Guy Taylor, and their daughter, Joyce Lee, moved in with her father and siblings. Mr. Corbitt, her father, would sleep in a chinaberry tree in the backyard, watching over the family while cradling a double-barreled shotgun, going inside to sleep only after the sun rose.As word of the crime spread through Alabama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s black community the N.A.A.C.P.‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Montgomery chapter sent Mrs. Parks, who had spent much of her childhood in Abbeville, to interview Mrs. Taylor.The deputy sheriff, Lewey Corbitt (not a close relation), was not happy about Mrs. Parks‚<U+0080><U+0099>s presence. He drove past the house repeatedly and then forcibly ejected her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want any troublemakers here in Abbeville,‚<U+0080>ù he warned her. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t go, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll lock you up.‚<U+0080>ùMindful of the outrage surrounding the case of the Scottsboro Boys ‚<U+0080><U+0094> nine black teenagers who had been wrongly accused of raping two white women in 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the county prosecutor took care to provide a semblance of equal justice. But it was an empty gesture.When the grand jury met on Oct. 3 and 4, 1944, Mrs. Taylor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s loved ones were the only witnesses. None of the men had been arrested, and there had not been a police lineup, so Mrs. Taylor could not identify her attackers.The grand jury declined to indict the men. Word spread through union halls, churches, barbershops, pool halls and, significantly, through the black press. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Alabama Whites Attack Woman; Not Punished,‚<U+0080>ù declared a headline in The Pittsburgh Courier, an African-American newspaper.It was the final year of World War II, and some blacks likened their struggle for equal rights to the fight against fascism. Eugene Gordon, a black writer for The Daily Worker, a Communist newspaper in New York, interviewed Mrs. Taylor and told his readers, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The raping of Mrs. Recy Taylor was a fascist-like brutal violation of her personal rights as a woman and as a citizen of democracy.‚<U+0080>ùAt an emergency meeting in the Hotel Theresa in Harlem on Nov. 25, 1944, the Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor, which Mrs. Parks had helped organize, became a national organization. It spearheaded a campaign of letters, petitions and postcards urging Gov. Chauncey Sparks to investigate.The governor, who was a mentor of the segregationist future governor George C. Wallace, came under considerable pressure as African-American activists like W. E. B. DuBois and Mary Church Terrell and writers like Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes took up Mrs. Taylor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cause.The governor sent investigators, who found that Sheriff Gamble had lied about having arrested the men. By then, four of the seven men had admitted to having had sex with Mrs. Taylor, but they insisted that she had participated willingly.One of the men, Willie Joe Culpepper, however, backed up Mrs. Taylor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account, saying she had been coerced.‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was crying and asking us to let her go home to her husband and baby,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Despite the confession, a second grand jury, on Feb. 14, 1945, refused to hand up an indictment.The civil rights activists eventually moved on, and Mrs. Taylor faded into obscurity. Fearing reprisals, she moved to Montgomery for a few months with help from Mrs. Parks. Eventually the family moved to Central Florida, where Mrs. Taylor picked oranges.She and Mr. Taylor separated, and he died in the early 1960s. Their only child died in a car crash in 1967. Mrs. Taylor had two subsequent partners, both of whom died. She lived for many years in Winter Haven, Fla., before failing health prompted her relatives to bring her back to Abbeville.In addition to her brother, she is survived by two sisters, Lillie Kinsey and Mary Murry; a granddaughter; and several great-grandchildren.The publication of Ms. McGuire‚<U+0080><U+0099>s book led to apologies from the mayor of Abbeville and from the county and state governments in 2011. The Alabama Legislature‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apology was formally presented to Mrs. Taylor on Mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Day that year at the Pentecostal church, now known as Abbeville Memorial Church of God in Christ, where she had worshiped the night of the crime.In Ms. Buirski‚<U+0080><U+0099>s film, Mrs. Taylor recalled how she could have easily been killed. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lord was just with me that night,‚<U+0080>ù she said.Planting a flag firmly at the intersection of patriarchy, sexism and white supremacy, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Rape of Recy Taylor‚<U+0080>ù is a documentary of multiple layers and marvelous gumption. As if apprised in advance of our current political moment, the director, Nancy Buirski, wields the titular violation as a signpost to a wider, more insidious American crime. In this way, the 1944 gang-rape of one black woman in Alabama becomes emblematic of the effacement of an entire gender.Were it not for the director‚<U+0080><U+0099>s steady hand and adamantine focus on her destination, this ambition could have been the film‚<U+0080><U+0099>s undoing. Instead, its scope is stirring, the gradual accumulation of insult and outrage reaching far beyond tiny Abbeville where the crime occurred and where Recy, then 24, lived with her husband and new daughter. The miracle, though, is that the movie isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t a diatribe. Its voices ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including several members of Recy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family and that of Rosa Parks herself, who investigated the assault ‚<U+0080><U+0094> are gentle and persuasive, using the horrific details of the rape and its aftermath as ballast to stabilize a heart-wrenching history of systemic injustice.The cleverness of this structure only gradually becomes apparent as Ms. Buirski slowly obliterates skin tone distinctions to land on a perfectly calibrated final section. Some may chide her, not without cause, for overreaching; yet the emotional impact of her deep-diving images ‚<U+0080><U+0094> especially the astonishing clips from the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>race films‚<U+0080>ù of the 1940s and earlier ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is profound. An evocative shot of a black woman in a white dress, fleeing from someone in graceful terror, reminds us repeatedly of the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s original atrocity.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They played in her body,‚<U+0080>ù Recy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sister Alma Daniels says at one point. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s perhaps the most devastating claim in a film overflowing with them.A FALSE REPORT A True Story of Rape in America By T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong 291 pp. Crown Publishers. $28.In 2008, an 18-year-old named Marie reported that she‚<U+0080><U+0099>d been raped. A stranger with a knife entered her apartment in Lynnwood, Wash., while she was sleeping, she told the police, tied her up with one of her shoestrings and blindfolded and gagged her. He then took photographs that he threatened to post online if she went to the police.It was a story out of a horror movie or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Law & Order‚<U+0080>ù script. Indeed, Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s foster mother, Peggy, thought of the TV show when she heard Marie recount her ordeal with, Peggy thought, an odd degree of emotional detachment. Peggy knew Marie to have a flair for drama, and she started to nurse doubt about whether her attention-getting tale was true. Another woman close to Marie, a second foster mother, was also uncertain. Peggy relayed her misgivings to the police, setting in motion a chain of disastrous decisions by the Lynnwood investigators that unraveled the life Marie was just beginning to make for herself, and gave T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong the title for their new book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A False Report.‚<U+0080>ùInterrogated as if she were a suspect and pressured to recant, Marie wound up facing criminal charges for lying to the police. She was a teenager coming out of foster care and her sense of self and her support system was tentative and fragile. She lost her subsidized apartment and many of her friends. Her plans to get a driver‚<U+0080><U+0099>s license and go to college floated away in a sea of despair.The John Grisham-worthy twist comes from the investigation of three rapes 1,300 miles away, in two suburbs and a city outside of Denver. The Police Departments in the three places in Colorado (Aurora, Golden and Westminster) pooled their clues and figured out they were probably looking for the same attacker. They found him ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the break in the case came from a single detail about the spotting of a white truck. On the rapist‚<U+0080><U+0099>s computer, they found the photos he took of Marie. Years later, here was incontrovertible proof that she had told the truth.The parallel tales allow Miller and Armstrong to juxtapose the damage of a botched rape investigation and the triumph of careful and skilled police work. Though stranger rape isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t the norm for sexual assault, or the focus of the sexual misconduct fueling the #MeToo moment in which this book appears, it offers broadly relevant lessons. One of the valiant detectives in Colorado (this is a book that turns law enforcement characters into heroes) explains that her rule isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t simply ‚<U+0080><U+009C>believe your victim‚<U+0080>ù; it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>listen and verify,‚<U+0080>ù which gives her space to refute or corroborate the account, depending on where the evidence takes her. Another detective in Aurora explains how he learned that there is no ‚<U+0080><U+009C>right way‚<U+0080>ù for a survivor to respond to an assault. The 65-year-old victim he interviewed was matter-of-fact rather than emotional, much like Marie, but he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t discount her credibility, and that withholding of judgment helped catch the serial attacker.Miller and Armstrong point out a pattern in Lynnwood. The police there wrote off as unfounded 21 percent of the rape reports they received during the five years in which the book unfolds. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s five times the national average. An external reviewer said that if the two police officers who interrogated Marie hadn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t documented their own ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bullying and coercive‚<U+0080>ù behavior, he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>would have been skeptical‚<U+0080>ù that such conduct actually happened. Though Miller and Armstrong don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say so, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one more telling illustration of who does or doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get the benefit of the doubt.One of the two officers who blew Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case comes across as a secondary villain. Jerry Rittgarn, who threatened Marie with jail if she failed a lie-detector test, left Lynnwood to work as a private investigator. He told Miller and Armstrong he would talk to them only if they paid him, while complaining about ‚<U+0080><U+009C>victims who lie‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>a biased story.‚<U+0080>ù The other officer, however, is introspective enough to be the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most complex figure. Sgt. Jeffrey Mason questioned whether he was qualified to do his job ‚<U+0080><U+0094> after more than 20 years as a cop ‚<U+0080><U+0094> when he learned he‚<U+0080><U+0099>d helped prosecute a vulnerable rape victim. When Marie asked for an apology, he showed up and said he was sorry; she found him sincere. Peggy disappointed Marie at first with her muted response but then expressed her intense regret and worked to repair their relationship.In Lynnwood, the Police Department didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t fire or discipline anyone, but it did try to learn from its mistakes, Miller and Armstrong reassuringly report. Lynnwood added training on the effect of trauma, which can cause rape victims‚<U+0080><U+0099> memories to fragment, and adopted well-respected guidelines, which train police officers not to doubt a victim because he or she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t behave as expected and ‚<U+0080><U+0094> crucially ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not to accuse one of lying without definite proof.Miller and Armstrong tell their story plainly, expertly and well. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s gripping and needs no dressing up. More confusing accounts of sexual assault, in which consent is disputed with anguish in a toxic swirl of partying and hook-up culture, have become part of the landscape, especially on college campuses. These contested stories divide our sympathies and spur angry debates. The doubt that Marie confronted, on the other hand, leaves no trail of did he or didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t he. In its moral clarity, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s possible to find Miller and Armstrong‚<U+0080><U+0099>s project comforting. There is a bad guy. His name is Marc O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s now in prison for life. (Actually, 327¬Ω years, so several lives.)Miller and Armstrong interviewed O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary in prison but it seems, understandably, as if it was hard for them to get into his head. In recreated flashbacks that rely on phrases like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the beast wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t rest‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the monster would gather strength,‚<U+0080>ù the authors show him stalking women and breaking into their homes by night. All the while, O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary was secretly operating a group of specialized porn sites. He was also playing guitar with his friends and planning to have a baby with his wife. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It sounds clich√©, I guess, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really kind of an actual Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in real life,‚<U+0080>ù O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary said at his own trial. That plus some idea about the duality of man, which he got from reading Carl Jung, are about as deep as it gets.Miller and Armstrong teamed up for the project that became this book when they discovered they were working on it separately. Miller was reporting on the Colorado angle for ProPublica, an investigative news organization, and Armstrong was chasing Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s story for the Marshall Project, a group that focuses on criminal justice journalism. They won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for an article that led to this book (a Netflix series is also in the works).Two years ago, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This American Life‚<U+0080>ù ran an episode (narrated by Armstrong and the producer Robyn Semien) that can serve as a nice companion to the book by giving us Marie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s voice on tape. At 25, she is raw but also resilient. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It broke me,‚<U+0080>ù she said of the doubt she was raped and its repercussions. But when the police told her O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Leary had been identified as her assailant, and that her criminal record would be expunged, she got her driver‚<U+0080><U+0099>s license and then a job as a truck driver. She is now married and has two children. Marie is a testament to the harm of poor police work that derails a rape investigation. But she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also a person living her life. That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the larger lesson of a nonfiction narrative like this one: It continues, beyond a book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s pages.NEW HAVEN ‚<U+0080><U+0094> On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, Leroy Harris appeared in court and pleaded guilty to kidnapping and robbery. The plea was a legal fiction and everybody knew it. He knew it. The prosecutors knew it. The judge knew it, too.Nearly 30 years ago, Mr. Harris was convicted of raping a woman in this Connecticut city ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a verdict he has been trying to reverse ever since. Earlier this year, after decades of fighting his appeals, the Connecticut state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office finally conceded that the evidence against him might be tainted. The prosecutors agreed to let him go ‚<U+0080><U+0094> if he took a deal.At the heart of the deal was something called an Alford plea, an odd legal paradox that required Mr. Harris to formally plead guilty to a set of lesser crimes, but not admit that he had actually committed them. After Mr. Harris played his role in this courtroom drama, the judge reduced his sentence to the years that he had served. Mr. Harris was freed on Tuesday evening, in time to spend Thanksgiving with his family.But the prosecutors also walked away with what they wanted. At least on paper, they were able to preserve their conviction. That ensured they would not have to conduct a second trial ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or face the consequences of bungling the first.In recent years, plea bargains of all sorts have dominated the criminal-justice system: They now account for almost 95 percent of the final dispositions in felony cases across the nation. Even the Supreme Court has acknowledged their pre-eminence, writing in 2012 that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.‚<U+0080>ùAlford pleas, however, are exceptionally rare, composing only 6 percent of all the guilty pleas in state and federal courts, according to a study published in 2009. While some legal experts have assailed them as a patent violation of due-process rights, others have described them as a psychological salve: They allow defendants to maintain their innocence even as they bow to the reality that they would likely be convicted at a trial.But then there are defendants like Mr. Harris, who entered his plea decades after his conviction and only, as he put it, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>under duress.‚<U+0080>ù Across the country, different prosecutorial agencies take different positions when facing cases that might be marred by a wrongful conviction. Some, like the Brooklyn district attorney‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office, have decided that the most just option is simply to reverse a bad conviction and wipe a defendant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s slate entirely clean. But others use guilty pleas and sentence modifications to free people from prison in dubious prosecutions.In Mr. Harris‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, the prosecutor who tried the matter had not disclosed exculpatory evidence. Scientific testing also showed that DNA on the victim‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clothes could not have come from him. The victim failed at first to pick out Mr. Harris in a photograph array, but then, at trial, identified him for the first time as the man who had attacked her. Earlier this year, a Connecticut judge made it impossible to rely on her testimony, ruling that prosecutors could no longer use witnesses whose sole identification of a suspect came in court.Legal experts say that even if defendants who enter guilty pleas are eventually released, they are often subject to collateral effects that could include losing government benefits or the legal right to vote. The strategy of hinging a release on entering a plea also allows a prosecutor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office to keep a guilty finding on its records and thus avoid being sued.‚<U+0080><U+009C>There are only two reasons to offer a plea after a conviction has occurred,‚<U+0080>ù said John Hollway, an associate dean at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who has written extensively about wrongful convictions. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in your case, but you also don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dismiss it, what are you really doing? You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re either trying to preserve your stats or protecting yourself against civil liability.‚<U+0080>ùKevin Kane, the chief state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney of Connecticut, disagreed. He insisted that his prosecutors look at troubled cases on an individual basis and sometimes do decide to dismiss the matter fully. That didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t happen in Mr. Harris‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case, he said, because evidence existed that convinced the office that it might have withstood an appeal.‚<U+0080><U+009C>In this case, we worked out a compromise, and I think it was a fair one,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Kane said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Does everybody walk away comfortable and happy? No. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a balance.‚<U+0080>ùFrom the moment he was charged with rape and robbery in 1989, Mr. Harris, 57, has insisted on his innocence. Even after his conviction ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for which he was sentenced to 80 years in prison ‚<U+0080><U+0094> he fought the verdict through five appeals.His lawyers from the Innocence Project said that about eight months ago they started making headway in negotiations with Patrick J. Griffin, the state‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attorney in New Haven, who gradually acknowledged there were problems in the case.When Mr. Harris‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyers told him that the prosecutors were questioning his case, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>it created an expectation that the state would do the right thing,‚<U+0080>ù one of the lawyers, Vanessa Potkin, said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It made Leroy think that he was on the precipice of freedom. But then the state came back and said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll only get your freedom if you take our deal.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThat set up a choice, Ms. Potkin said: Mr. Harris could take the Alford plea and be free to share Thanksgiving with his family. Or he could keep on fighting, perhaps for many years, as courts in Connecticut considered his appeal.In the end, he took the deal. He spent Thanksgiving in New Haven at a festive family dinner with more than 100 relatives.‚<U+0080><U+009C>They were going to drag it out for years,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Harris said on Wednesday evening, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>but 50 percent of something is better than 100 percent of nothing.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>For all those years I fought it and fought it,‚<U+0080>ù he explained. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They knew they had to let me go, but they didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to let me go clean.‚<U+0080>ùMULTAN, Pakistan ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Pakistani police have arrested 12 people ‚<U+0080><U+0094> including members of a village council, elders and relatives ‚<U+0080><U+0094> for ordering a man to rape a girl in revenge for the rape of his sister.Police officer Rehmat Ali says the 12 were brought before a court, which allows police to investigate them for a week without bail.He said on Monday that following the rape of a village girl, the family of the alleged rapist, Wasim Saeed of Pirmahal, sought pardon from the girl's family.Both sides agreed to reconcile on the condition of a 'revenge rape' of the suspect ed rapist's sister.Such revenge assaults, called ""wani,"" are still being practiced in some parts of rural areas of Pakistan, though they are banned under the law.Russell Simmons has once again been accused of rape. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.In the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>She was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,‚<U+0080>ù the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.The complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he ‚<U+0080><U+009C>vehemently‚<U+0080>ù denied all of the allegations. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,‚<U+0080>ù the statement said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests.‚<U+0080>ùOver the past few months, Mr. Simmons has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault or rape by multiple women, and is the focus of a police investigation in New York City. In January, an aspiring filmmaker named Jennifer Jarosik filed a $5 million lawsuit that claimed Mr. Simmons attacked her during a 2016 visit to his home. He stepped down from his companies in November.PARIS ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A judicial official says that the father-in-law of Pippa Middleton, the sister of the wife of Britain's Prince William, has been handed preliminary charges by a French judge for alleged rape of a minor for events in the 1990s.The official said on Friday that David Matthews was questioned three days earlier by special police handling cases involving minors.  An investigation magistrate filed a preliminary charge of ""rape of a minor by a person in authority."" The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the case and asked to remain anonymous.The official said the alleged events dated to 1998 and 1999.  French press reports that the complaint was filed by a niece couldn't be immediately confirmed.Preliminary charges call for further investigation and can be dropped with insufficient evidence.Matthews was allowed to remain free but must periodically report to judicial authorities.He became Pippa Middleton's father-in-law after her marriage last year to hedge fund manager James Matthews.JEFFERSON‚<U+0080><U+0099>S DAUGHTERS Three Sisters, White and Black, in a Young America By Catherine Kerrison Illustrated. 425 pp. Ballantine Books. $28.Fawn Brodie would be astonished ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and gratified. In 1974, her biography ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History‚<U+0080>ù contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>excoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.‚<U+0080>ù A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Jefferson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Daughters,‚<U+0080>ù Kerrison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s beautifully written book, takes the relationship‚<U+0080><U+0099>s existence as a given.And so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha‚<U+0080><U+0099>s and Maria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life.Kerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha‚<U+0080><U+0099>s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account of the girls‚<U+0080><U+0099> residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.The lives of four Virginia families ‚<U+0080><U+0094> Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses ‚<U+0080><U+0094> were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s companion. Following Hemings‚<U+0080><U+0099>s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>run‚<U+0080>ù in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.The book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother ‚<U+0080><U+0094> along with the Randolph family ‚<U+0080><U+0094> lived as adjuncts to the plantation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s comfort; Kerrison comments that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>family life, however, was architecturally all but invisible‚<U+0080>ù there; the master‚<U+0080><U+0099>s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.‚<U+0080>ùIn 1873, Harriet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s younger brother Madison offered deliberately opaque clues about her, declaring that she was ‚<U+0080><U+009C>passing‚<U+0080>ù and had married a prosperous white man in Washington, D.C. Kerrison identified 58 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Harriets‚<U+0080>ù who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830. She takes readers along on her research journey through disparate records, but ultimately concludes that Harriet Hemings ‚<U+0080><U+009C>will keep her secret.‚<U+0080>ùThe last chapter, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Legacies,‚<U+0080>ù ruminates on the fate of each of the women from a contemporary perspective. Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s reproductive health threaten ‚<U+0080><U+009C>to return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,‚<U+0080>ù making Maria‚<U+0080><U+0099>s fate ‚<U+0080><U+009C>both timely and crucial.‚<U+0080>ù Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison‚<U+0080><U+0099>s musings on women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s education, for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>in spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,‚<U+0080>ù with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day. And Harriet, who passed as white, most likely abandoning her family in the process, prompts Kerrison to wonder about the persistence of racism in American society. Why, she asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>do the discredited ideologies of gender and race continue to control and separate Americans so powerfully?‚<U+0080>ùIn 2010, a church hymnal that once belonged to Harriet Tubman ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the American abolitionist hero who, after escaping slavery in 1849, devoted her new freedom to leading hundreds more of her fellow enslaved out of captivity, first as a conductor on the underground railroad and then later as a Union spy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> was donated to the National Museum of African American History and Culture by the collector and historian Charles L. Blockson. Given to him by Tubman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s great-grandniece Mariline Wilkins (the daughter of Eva Stewart Northrup, whose signature is inscribed inside the book‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cover), it was just one of dozens of Tubman‚<U+0080><U+0099>s belongings bequeathed to the museum that day. Eric Williams, the curator of religion at the Smithsonian‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, considers the book particularly revelatory, given that Tubman was illiterate. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>This idea of having a sacred book and not being able to read it,‚<U+0080>ù he said in a phone interview, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a window into her piety. And it is in line with a longer tradition one finds in the black religious experience in North America.‚<U+0080>ù Although many black men and women, whether enslaved or free, could not read them, he explained, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>these books ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the Bible and hymnals ‚<U+0080><U+0094> bore witness to the liberating power of the Gospel contained within their pages.‚<U+0080>ù Williams told me that for Tubman, who could sing every word it contains, this hymnal would have been ‚<U+0080><U+009C>invested with a spiritual power,‚<U+0080>ù and that it is a text to be valued ‚<U+0080><U+009C>not just as literature but as artifact ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as an object of devotion.‚<U+0080>ùNo matter how beguiling and colorful my salad dreams may be, when the hectic swirl of weeknight dinner begins, I routinely ditch them for plain greens tossed with lemon juice and olive oil. Adding a grated garlic clove to the dressing is the height of my after-work ambitions.Happily, this never happens to Ilene Rosen, whose cookbook, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Saladish‚<U+0080>ù (Artisan, 2018), came out this month. Ms. Rosen, a co-owner of R&D Foods in Brooklyn, does for salads what Brooks Headley did for veggie burgers: elevates them from the quotidian to the thrilling.Ms. Rosen became obsessed with salads when she was the savory chef at City Bakery, down the block from the Union Square Greenmarket.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d see all this beautiful produce piled up, and I was never satisfied with two little bags,‚<U+0080>ù she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d have to buy it by the case and figure out what to do with it.‚<U+0080>ùMuch experimentation later, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s uncomfortable putting in a salad, as long as the combination makes sense ‚<U+0080><U+0094> though, she adds, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>what makes sense to me might be more broadly defined than to most people.‚<U+0080>ùCase in point: Her salad of tofu skins, edamame, Chinese preserved cabbage and raw mustard greens. It sounds bizarre, tastes wonderful: silky, tangy, crunchy and very fresh.Other recipes are more intuitive, though they still have surprising twists. To a simple salad of zucchini ribbons and squash blossoms, she adds slivers of Gouda for creaminess, pumpkin seeds for crunch and dandelion greens for what she describes as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the fluffy factor.‚<U+0080>ùHer red potato salad is layered with chorizo and roasted grapes. She tosses red cabbage with chickpeas and tahini for a rich, multitextured slaw.But what really inspired me was her take on dips for crudit√©s, which I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m going to incorporate into my Passover Seder this year. After dipping the greens, herbs and vegetables into the requisite salt water (symbolizing the tears of the enslaved Israelites), I plan to leave the vegetables on the table during dinner, and bring out several of Ms. Rosen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recipes for continued dipping.There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s her sweet lime salt, an intriguing combination of sugar, salt and grated lime zest for sprinkling on cucumbers, radishes and the like; a luscious avocado-mint cream; and a tangy cilantro cumin dip that also would make a good sauce for the gefilte fish.None of this may sound strictly like salad, but that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Ms. Rosen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s point. And it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s saladish enough for me.Recipes: Cilantro-Cumin Dip | Avocado-Mint Dip | Lime-Sugar Dipping SaltFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

The first of course was the sheer pleasure of the cooking. (Without that, the others wouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t matter.) The food is Southern, which I was primed to like before I walked through JuneBaby‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Dutch doors in this city‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Ravenna neighborhood. And whenever Edouardo Jordan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s menu offered a dish I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d expect to see at a Southern restaurant, he gave me something better than I‚<U+0080><U+0099>d imagined.Fried catfish over grits can be better in theory than reality. At JuneBaby, the fish, from an Idaho farm, is firm, tight, fresh and free of bottom-feeder muddiness. The crust is semolina, which stays crisp and unsoggy. The grits are fluffy, yellow, full of corn flavor. Ringing the grits is an orange circle of shrimp bisque. Strictly speaking, shrimp bisque has no business on fish and grits, but if you see the bisque as a tamer, richer stand-in for hot sauce it makes a delicious kind of sense.This is the tactic ‚<U+0080><U+0094> find superior ingredients and bring some fancy kitchen tricks to bear on them ‚<U+0080><U+0094> favored by most of the South‚<U+0080><U+0099>s prominent restaurants. If that were all Mr. Jordan had in mind, I would still think JuneBaby is a very good restaurant. But on the menu of this nearly year-old establishment are dishes that I wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t expecting, that many of those other restaurants don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t serve, that pulled me in deeper.Like any good Southern chef, Mr. Jordan loves his pork. But I paid closer attention when I noticed which parts of the pig he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cooking. He will boil ham hocks with collard greens until the leaves are soft and velvety and wonderfully smoky. He stews pigs‚<U+0080><U+0099> ears until they surrender their ornery stiffness, then slices and fries them into irresistible, crunchy sticks. He seasons okra and tomatoes with a North African spice mix and stews them with hog maw, otherwise known as the outer wall of the stomach.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Almost nobody likes it,‚<U+0080>ù Josh Ozersky wrote of hog maw in Esquire in 2014, a year before he died. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s tough and tasteless, like the chitterlings to which it is attached.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Jordan would disagree. By the way, he cooks chitterlings, too.These are the cuts that enslaved black people on plantations were allowed to keep when hogs were killed; after Emancipation, these were the cuts they might have had the money to afford and the skills to make into something memorable. Their healthy representation on the menu tells you that JuneBaby is not just a Southern restaurant but, specifically, a black Southern restaurant.Of course, much of the huge edifice of Southern food was built by black farmers and black cooks: as enslaved people in plantation kitchens and in their own families‚<U+0080><U+0099> cabins; later, as domestic servants, hotel chefs, railroad cooks, restaurateurs and entrepreneurs. Mr. Jordan is interested in all of it, but he particularly wants to introduce customers to the food of his family.He was raised in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the surrounding culture wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t particularly Southern but his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s table was. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The food she cooked was the only food she knew,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Jordan said in a phone interview. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>That‚<U+0080><U+0099>s where I got my experience of fried fish, fried chicken, braised meats, offals, bread pudding.‚<U+0080>ùJuneBaby‚<U+0080><U+0099>s oxtails are a tribute to one of her mainstays. Mr. Jordan deepens the flavor of the beef by roasting it before braising. He focuses the broth by clarifying it with egg whites, as he would have done in culinary school and in kitchens where he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worked, such as the French Laundry in California and Per Se and Lincoln Ristorante in New York. But he doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t try to prettify what the menu calls Momma Jordan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Oxtails, serving them whole, with cubes of turnip and rutabaga, the hunks of beef barely hanging onto tailbones whose wide, white wings flare out like propeller blades.The chitterlings are essentially his paternal grandmother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s recipe, stewed with onions, carrots and garlic. Instead of water, he might use some chicken stock, or the collagen-rich liquid thrown off by the pigs‚<U+0080><U+0099> ears. Rather than use a pot on the stove, he softens them in a pressure cooker. This both speeds the process by several hours and allows him to welcome the customers who line up each night waiting for the doors to open into a dining room that does not smell like intestines.As variety meats go, intestines are not at the top of my list. Out of strong curiosity, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve eaten them packed into andouillettes in France, fried and kept under heat lamps in a gas station in Mississippi, and grilled over charcoal in the backyard of a Korean restaurant in Queens. I liked them best at JuneBaby.‚<U+0080><U+009C>My grandmother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chitterlings were a thing I loved, but never talked about,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Jordan said, a thought that will sound familiar to immigrants and other people whose families‚<U+0080><U+0099> food veers from the mainstream American diet. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You tell your friends as a kid you eat chitterlings, they run away from you.‚<U+0080>ùEventually he ran away from them, too, until he began to prepare a follow-up to his first restaurant as both chef and owner, Salare, down the street. The menu at Salare, he has said, expresses what he has learned in his career, centering on the Italian and French food he made in other people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s restaurants. JuneBaby, though, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>speaks on who I am as an individual soul and as an African-American male.‚<U+0080>ù And to do that he realized he would need to go back to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>these ingredients that we don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to talk about‚<U+0080>ù and start to show them off.Junebaby‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chitterlings never come off the menu. They are not a huge revenue center for the restaurant but they may be, in a cultural sense, a loss leader.The dining room has a welcoming, domestic atmosphere; somehow it always feels as if a warm breeze were blowing through the screens, even in winter with the windows shut.For all the braised and simmered and stewed dishes, the kitchen glides easily into lighter territory. Vegetables keep their crunch. Bright green broccoli is tossed with grated Cheddar, almonds, apples and very delicate puffs of pork skin, all of them sharpened by preserved-lemon vinaigrette.The buttermilk biscuits and raised dinner rolls, known here as Antebellum Wheat Buns, are made with a light, practiced hand under the direction of Margaryta Karagodina, the pastry chef. Red-flint cornbread, baked in an iron skillet, gets its minerally sweetness from sorghum.Some of the desserts are slices of church-supper favorites, like a rich brick of bread pudding, interspersed with dark chocolate and soft apricots, sitting on cr√®me anglaise. The Black Forest cake was the kind you rarely see anymore, three chocolate-cake layers frosted with cocoa-dusted whipped cream.Alongside one of these, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a good idea to let Mr. Jordan take you all the way back to the beginning of his career and have a flip. This is frozen fruit juice ‚<U+0080><U+0094> pineapple the night I had it ‚<U+0080><U+0094> in a paper cup, a tribute to the homemade Popsicles Mr. Jordan used to whip up out of powdered drink mix and sell when he was a boy in St. Petersburg. If the word flip doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ring a bell, one of its other names might: huckabuck, hucklebuck, frozen cup, freeze cup, cool cup.If you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re still in the dark, a definition can be found in the JuneBaby encyclopedia. This still-growing document, found on the restaurant‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website, defines menu terms and concepts in Southern cuisine from Aunt Jemima to yams (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Most common African staple that fed enslaved Africans on board ships.‚<U+0080>ù).The encyclopedia is another way JuneBaby drew me in. It nudged me to consider what I was eating. And it situated Mr. Jordan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s family recipes in a centuries-long arc of American history. Many restaurants start with a chef‚<U+0080><U+0099>s personal story. JuneBaby traces that story back to where it meets the country‚<U+0080><U+0099>s.Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest. Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice.One of the best episodes of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Star Trek: The Next Generation‚<U+0080>ù was the two-part ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Best of Both Worlds,‚<U+0080>ù in which the Borg kidnap Picard and turn him into Locutus. Through a different lens, though, this was a story about Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who is forced to take command of the Enterprise and is unsure whether he is ready to do so. On its surface, the story was about the lengths a crew will go to save Picard and the potential destruction of the Federation. But it was also, if not more so, about seeing Riker develop beyond just a competent first officer. (Part of this was due to Patrick Stewart‚<U+0080><U+0099>s contract negotiations.)Along the same lines, the fifth episode of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery‚<U+0080>ù is about Saru (played brilliantly by Doug Jones), who is unsure of himself after taking command following Captain Lorca‚<U+0080><U+0099>s kidnapping. I should note here that Spock faces a similar circumstance in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,‚<U+0080>ù but at that point, Spock was a fully realized character, unlike Saru. Still, the Kelpien rises to the task magnificently, proving himself a decisive and competent commander.Historically, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Star Trek‚<U+0080>ù series have been ensemble shows. The first four episodes of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery,‚<U+0080>ù though, were almost entirely focused on Burnham. Here, for the first time, we see supporting characters do something other than mope or snap at Burnham. Paul Stamets, the first openly gay television character in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Star Trek‚<U+0080>ù history, has a nice scene with his partner, the ship‚<U+0080><U+0099>s doctor, Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz), in which we learn he is capable of something other than being grouchy.Some of the early ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery‚<U+0080>ù plotting paid off in this episode. When the ship rescues Lorca and escapes Klingon space, it is revealed that Stamets used his own body to operate the spore drive. Given that the show has quickly killed off several main characters so far, I legitimately thought that Stamets was a goner. Same for when Lorca was on the Klingon ship.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery‚<U+0080>ù hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t lacked for tension. It has had moments of shaky storytelling and character development, however. Thankfully, this episode delivered a near-perfect mix of all three elements.1. Rainn Wilson as Harry MuddRoger Carmel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s portrayal of Mudd in the original original series was pretty silly and, seen now, is oddly reminiscent of Wilson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Dwight Schrute from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Office.‚<U+0080>ùBut the writers have given Wilson a lot more to work with here. A political ideology, for starters. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I sure as hell understand why the Klingons pushed back. Starfleet arrogance,‚<U+0080>ù says Mudd, suggesting he has interests beyond self-enrichment. This makes him potentially a more potent villain than the one in the original series. Wilson also plays deceit with great skill. I am curious to see what they do with him.2. Lorca on the Klingon shipLorca confesses that he blew up the ship he previously commanded so that he could save his crew from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>degradation, torture‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>slow, public death‚<U+0080>ù at the hands of the Klingons. Lorca is one of the show‚<U+0080><U+0099>s more enigmatic characters: confident, cold and calculating. He doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to have much of a moral center, which makes him different than previous ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Trek‚<U+0080>ù captains.This story line shows, again, the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery‚<U+0080>ù writers‚<U+0080><U+0099> willingness to take risks. That Lorca is willing to blow his own crew up gives us a window into his thinking and provides more context for his lack of emotion regarding Landry‚<U+0080><U+0099>s death. And most importantly: We understand why he was eager to have Burnham, Starfleet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s only known mutineer, be part of the ship‚<U+0080><U+0099>s crew.Near the end of the escape, Tyler tells Lorca what happened when his old ship was destroyed. Lorca responds, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We choose our own pain. Mine helps me remember.‚<U+0080>ù I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t quite understand what this exchange meant, but I imagine we‚<U+0080><U+0099>ll find out soon.1. The KlingonsOnce again, Klingons are painted as a one-dimensional species with no depth or intelligence. How are two Klingons (a warrior race), one armed, overpowered by two weakened prisoners? And how are Lorca and Tyler so easily able to commandeer a shuttle? And how do they escape five Klingon raider ships so easily? (This was an issue in previous ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Trek‚<U+0080>ù series as well, but I digress.)1. When Saru asks the computer for decorated Starfleet captains, there are several familiar names on the list: Jonathan Archer, the main character in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Enterprise,‚<U+0080>ù played by Scott Bakula and Christopher Pike, who appeared in both the 2009 reboot of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Star Trek‚<U+0080>ù and the original series. There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also Matt Decker, who was in the original series episode, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Doomsday Machine,‚<U+0080>ù and Robert April, who was revealed to be the Enterprise‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first captain in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Animated Series.‚<U+0080>ù His character was voiced by James Doohan, who of course, played Scotty.2. When the Discovery bridge crew narrows the search down to three possible locations for Lorca, one of the three listed is Rura Penthe, the penal colony that Kirk and McCoy were sent to in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Undiscovered Country.‚<U+0080>ùEager to guarantee her social fitness at a new school before the term begins, the teenage Auralie (Kira McLean) badgers her parents, Jean and Jim (Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson), into allowing her to get a permanent. Arguing poverty, Auralie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mother and father take her to a beauty-training salon for the procedure, and her-once slack locks, left in tight curlers too long, are majorly poofed. Her hair looks like Bob Dylan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s on the cover of his landmark album ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blonde on Blonde.‚<U+0080>ù That was great for Dylan in 1966 New York, but not so much for an adolescent girl ‚<U+0080><U+009C>somewhere in Virginia,‚<U+0080>ù according to a title card, in 1982.Written and directed by Colette Burson, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Permanent‚<U+0080>ù uses hair and hairstyles as a metaphor for self-worth. Besides Auralie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unfortunate situation, Jim, a former Air Force One steward now trying to get through med school, is attached to a very unconvincing toupee. The metaphor goes limp after about 20 minutes. This family comedy then flails about, serving up coming-of-age anecdotes involving mean girls, karate classes and sexually predatory boys. One new ‚<U+0080><U+009C>friend‚<U+0080>ù of Auralie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s is eager to show her his penis (what is it with guys, anyway?), which, he insists, looks like E.T. The movie wraps up by cashing in on an interracial friendship subplot for Auralie, a putative feel-good flourish that just feels unearned, to say the least.As the parents, Mr. Wilson and Ms. Arquette seem just about as tired as the characters they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re playing. As Auralie, Ms. McLean is appealing and fresh-faced and could do well in a better coming-of-age movie in a few years.The #MeToo Moment deluged the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dear Sugars‚<U+0080>ù inbox with letters about sexual harassment in the workplace. In the final episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars read some of these letters and discuss what happens when non-consensual sexual attention moves from the private to the public realm.One letter comes from a young woman who landed a gig assisting a well-known artist after months of job searching. On her first day of work, she was coerced into posing half-naked on his floor ‚<U+0080><U+0094> afraid to object ‚<U+0080><U+009C>for fear of the consequences.‚<U+0080>ù Should she continue to work for the artist, or quit and face unemployment?The lawyer and organizer Saru Jayaraman joins the Sugars to discuss the power dynamics between low-paid employees and the people who sexually harass them. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Harassment is not about individual actions, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s about systemic situations of structural power,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Jayaraman explains. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We need women to feel supported, we need them to be able to stand up for themselves, and we need to change laws and policies that create these systems in the first place.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Jayaraman is the co-founder and president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and the director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.

Center in New York; and RAINN, an organization that supports victims of sexual violence.Mr. Chalamet also sought to explain his previous reticence about his decision to appear in a film directed by Mr. Allen, who faces allegations dating back to 1993 that he sexually abused his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. Mr. Allen has denied the allegations.Mr. Chalamet said that, owing to ‚<U+0080><U+009C>contractual obligations,‚<U+0080>ù he had been unable to answer questions posed by reporters and critics on the subject. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to profit from my work on the film,‚<U+0080>ù Mr. Chalamet said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.‚<U+0080>ùThe move comes on the heels of other actors having distanced themselves from Mr. Allen. On Friday, Mr. Chalamet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s co-star, Rebecca Hall, announced in an Instagram post that she was donating her wages from ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Rainy Day in New York‚<U+0080>ù to Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up.Ms. Hall, who also starred in Mr. Allen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 2008 film ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Vicky Cristina Barcelona,‚<U+0080>ù said she had been affected by public statements made by Ms. Farrow regarding her alleged abuse by Mr. Allen. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I see, not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Hall said.In October, after the Harvey Weinstein allegations, Ms. Farrow questioned why Mr. Allen had been spared similar scrutiny of his past actions. In an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Farrow also alleged that actors and other movie industry insiders had covered up for Mr. Allen.In 2014, Ms. Farrow spoke out publicly for the first time about the 1993 allegations. In an open letter published in The New York Times, she said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>For so long, Woody Allen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s acceptance silenced me. It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away.‚<U+0080>ùOn Jan. 10, Mira Sorvino wrote an open letter to Ms. Farrow in which she expressed regret about working with Mr. Allen. Ms. Sorvino won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her role as a prostitute in Mr. Allen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 1995 film ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Mighty Aphrodite.‚<U+0080>ù In her letter, published on HuffPost, she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I will never work with him again.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Sorvino‚<U+0080><U+0099>s letter came a day after Greta Gerwig, who performed in Mr. Allen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 2012 movie ‚<U+0080><U+009C>To Rome with Love,‚<U+0080>ù told The New York Times that she, too, would not work with Mr. Allen in future. In an online discussion, Ms. Gerwig said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film. I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.‚<U+0080>ùFor the first time on television, Dylan Farrow accused her father, Woody Allen, of molesting her as a child, telling ‚<U+0080><U+009C>CBS This Morning‚<U+0080>ù: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I want to show my face and tell my story.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t I want to bring him down?‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Farrow, 32, told Gayle King during a conversation that aired on Wednesday and Thursday. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Why shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t I be angry? Why shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t I be hurt? Why shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t I feel some sort of outrage that after all these years, being ignored and disbelieved and tossed aside?‚<U+0080>ùMs. Farrow, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and Mr. Allen, had made the allegations before: First, they were investigated in 1992, and detailed in an article in Vanity Fair. This would be the year of a very public and acrimonious split between Ms. Farrow and Mr. Allen, as well as a bitter custody battle that would dominate headlines.Dylan Farrow again raised the allegations in a 2014 letter published by the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. And on CBS, she went into detail about her experience during a period when Hollywood is reckoning with an industrywide movement against sexual misconduct that has brought down powerful figures in Hollywood such as Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein.‚<U+0080><U+009C>I was taken to a small attic crawl space in my mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s country house in Connecticut by my father,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Farrow said, describing an encounter with Mr. Allen that she said occurred in 1992. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He instructed me to lay down on my stomach and play with my brother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s toy train that was set up. And he sat behind me in the doorway, and as I played with the toy train, I was sexually assaulted.‚<U+0080>ùShe added: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>As a 7-year-old I would say, I would have said he touched my private parts. Which I did say. As a 32-year-old, he touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.‚<U+0080>ùThere were other instances, according to Ms. Farrow: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He often asked me to get into bed with him when he had only his underwear on and sometimes when only I had my underwear on.‚<U+0080>ùDr. John M. Leventhal, the doctor who led the Connecticut investigation into Mr. Allen, interviewed Ms. Farrow nine times in 1992 and said that he found inconsistencies in her story, even raising the possibility that she may have been coached by her mother.When pressed by Ms. King on whether she had been coached, Ms. Farrow said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How is this crazy story of me being brainwashed and coached more believable than what I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m saying about being sexually assaulted by my father?‚<U+0080>ù She said that her mother had never coached her.At one point, Ms. Farrow became emotional as Ms. King played a clip from an interview Mr. Allen did with ‚<U+0080><U+009C>60 Minutes‚<U+0080>ù in 1992 vehemently denying the allegations, as he has always done.‚<U+0080><U+009C>He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lying and he‚<U+0080><U+0099>s been lying for so long,‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Farrow said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And it is difficult for me to see him and to hear his voice. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Allen has always maintained that Ms. Farrow‚<U+0080><U+0099>s account is untrue, and he has never been charged with a crime. In a statement to CBS News, he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t make it any more true today than it was in the past. I never molested my daughter ‚<U+0080><U+0094> as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago.‚<U+0080>ùRecently, more Hollywood stars have begun speaking out against Mr. Allen and have expressed support for Ms. Farrow, including Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman and Reese Witherspoon.Timoth√©e Chalamet, the star of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Call Me by Your Name,‚<U+0080>ù a movie that has been receiving Oscar buzz, announced on Tuesday that he would be donating the wages from his work on Mr. Allen‚<U+0080><U+0099>s upcoming film ‚<U+0080><U+009C>A Rainy Day in New York‚<U+0080>ù to Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up, the recently established sexual harassment initiative; RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, which combats sexual violence; and the L.G.B.T. Center in New York.When asked if she was angry with those in Hollywood who still choose to work with her father, Ms. Farrow said: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not angry with them. I hope that, you know, especially since so many of them have been vocal advocates of this Me Too and Time‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Up movement, that they can acknowledge their complicity and maybe hold themselves accountable to how they have perpetuated this culture of silence in their industry.‚<U+0080>ùHow can parents know if a doctor is touching a child in an inappropriate way?After scores of young women testified about being sexually molested by Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for the American gymnastics team who was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on Wednesday, their parents wondered how they could have missed the signs. Some were even in the exam room at the time but were unaware that anything was wrong.Detecting sexual abuse in a medical setting can be challenging. We teach young children that doctors are among the only people allowed to touch their genitals. That can make it confusing if a patient encounters an abusive physician like Dr. Nassar.‚<U+0080><U+009C>The natural inclination is to trust a doctor, especially when they tell you, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>This is something that will make you feel better,‚<U+0080><U+0099> ‚<U+0080>ù said Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, or RAINN.That said, parents should trust their instincts. If they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re alarmed by a health provider‚<U+0080><U+0099>s practices ‚<U+0080><U+0094> frequent genital exams, unconventional medical treatments that involve genital manipulation, disregard for rules about using gloves during sensitive exams or having an adult chaperone present during a child‚<U+0080><U+0099>s exam, even inappropriate jokes or comments ‚<U+0080><U+0094> they should question the doctor, get another opinion or switch doctors, experts said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>If you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re in a situation where the physician does genital exams for medical complaints that don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to warrant them, or does a genital exam that takes an extraordinary amount of time ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it should really just be a quick look, unless there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s something notable, a specific reason ‚<U+0080><U+0094> those are red flags,‚<U+0080>ù said Dr. Cindy Christian, a co-author of the American Academy of Pediatrics‚<U+0080><U+0099>s policy on protecting children from sexual abuse by health care providers. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>If the complaint is a sore throat or a hurt finger, there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no need to examine the genitals.‚<U+0080>ùThe most telling indication that something may be wrong is when a child signals discomfort or distress. Most physicians who treat children and adolescents go to great lengths to put their young patients at ease, talking the patient through an exam or procedure in advance so the child knows what to expect, explaining the reasons for the procedure, and making sure the child is on board.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very important that people not feel uncomfortable with what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening to them at the doctor‚<U+0080><U+0099>s office, particularly children and adolescents,‚<U+0080>ù said Dr. Julia Potter, an adolescent medicine specialist at Boston Medical Center. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>They should not be made to feel that something is happening to their body that is out of their control. If a child says, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want you to check my breasts,‚<U+0080><U+0099> or, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want you to do a genital exam,‚<U+0080><U+0099> that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a valid opinion that most pediatricians would respect.‚<U+0080>ùAnd if your children share their distress with you, don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dismiss it. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Believe your children when they tell you that what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s happening to them feels uncomfortable,‚<U+0080>ù said Katelyn Brewer, president and chief executive of Darkness to Light, a nonprofit organization that educates adults on how to recognize and prevent child sexual abuse.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Come straight out and ask your child: Did the doctor touch you in a way that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re uncomfortable with?‚<U+0080>ù Ms. Brewer said.Annual physicals for children and teenagers usually entail a full-body examination, including a check of the genitals that can help monitor development as children go through puberty. But unless the child has a specific complaint, these exams are usually brief.Boys usually have a testicular exam once a year, but should be able to opt out if they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re uncomfortable. These typically last less than a minute. The boy usually stands, removing only as much clothing as necessary; the doctor feels each testicle for masses and generally will use gloves, though there is no internal penetration of any part of the body.Parents are usually in the room when young children are being examined, but teens may not want a parent present. Doctors should offer to have an adult chaperone come in during a sensitive procedure like a genital exam; if no one is available, the patient should have the option of postponing the exam, Dr. Christian said.For girls, visual and manual breast exams may be done to assess growth and development during puberty, but manual exams are not required and should be carried out only with the adolescent‚<U+0080><U+0099>s permission.A breast exam is done with the pads of the fingers, not the finger tips or palm of the hand, and the patient should wear a gown, with only one breast exposed at a time.Even in a gynecological visit, there is rarely any reason to do an internal pelvic exam on girls younger than 21, the age when screening for cervical cancer is recommended. Unusual symptoms like pelvic pain could trigger a pelvic exam earlier, but the doctor should explain to the patient exactly what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s entailed, step-by-step, before initiating the exam, and always wear gloves.‚<U+0096>† Talk with children ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and listen, said Jenny Coleman, director of Stop It Now!, an organization that works to prevent child sexual abuse. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s never too early to talk to children about healthy sexual development and how their bodies work, and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s private ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and to make them feel comfortable asking questions, and know that you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re a trusted person to come to.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0096>† If you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re unsure about an exam or treatment a doctor recommends for your child, ask if alternatives are available ‚<U+0080><U+0094> there is almost always another option ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or postpone it until you have more information. Get a second opinion, do your own research, and ask other parents, family members and trusted friends.‚<U+0096>† The American Academy of Pediatrics urges parents to report suspicions of sexually inappropriate behavior by a provider to an office manager, clinic medical director or hospital administrator, who should evaluate the concerns and take steps to protect other patients while an investigation is ongoing; parents who are reasonably certain that abuse has taken place can make a report directly to law enforcement.‚<U+0096>† If you or your child have a bad feeling about your doctor, find a new one. Teenage girls often prefer a female pediatrician. But don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t forget that women may also be abusive or that boys can also be abused, and may be even less likely than girls to report it.‚<U+0080><U+009C>You always have the right to change physicians if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re unhappy or even just uncomfortable with your child‚<U+0080><U+0099>s care,‚<U+0080>ù Dr. Christian said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There might be nothing wrong ‚<U+0080><U+0094> it just might not be the right doctor for you.‚<U+0080>ùKati Nicole Lake and Brian Michael Boyd were married Aug. 12 at the Harold Pratt House in New York.

Eventually, they figure it out and find a way to break it, thanks to an advantage that other starships don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have: an android. (Data probably should‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve used future Google to look up the plot for ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Groundhog Day,‚<U+0080>ù but we digress.)The Discovery‚<U+0080><U+0099>s advantage is Stamets, whose dabbling in mycelium somehow gives him the ability to remember all the time loop experiences to warn Burnham and Lorca in future occurrences. This episode also features the return of Rainn Wilson as Harry Mudd, who weaponizes that time loop to sell out the Discovery to the Klingons, partially to get revenge for being abandoned in a Klingon prison. ( Mudd kind of had a point there.)The best episodes of the ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Star Trek‚<U+0080>ù franchise are often ambitious, adventurous and teach us something new about the characters. On top of that: They are fun. In ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Cause and Effect,‚<U+0080>ù the Enterprise crew realizes something is amiss because of a poker game. In this week‚<U+0080><U+0099>s episode, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Magic To Make The Sanest Man Go Mad,‚<U+0080>ù a party is used as the vehicle of choice to solve a complex problem. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery‚<U+0080>ù has often lacked the ability to have fun with itself. This was the first episode to even try and it worked, even while keeping the stakes as high as possible. It did just enough, however, to make it more than just a direct rip-off.The portrayals of Harry Mudd by Roger Carmel in the original series and Mr. Wilson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery‚<U+0080>ù are distinctly different. Yet, this show made a curious choice in the end. Mr. Carmel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Mudd was a bit of a fool and hardly a man of extreme malevolence. Mr. Wilson‚<U+0080><U+0099>s is a murderous villain, one who delights in mass murders of Starfleet personnel. For the purposes of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Discovery,‚<U+0080>ù it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a choice that Mr. Wilson makes work. And yet, at the end of the episode, Stella, Mudd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lover, arrives and says she understands Mudd‚<U+0080><U+0099>s plight. Lorca and his crew let Mudd go, even though he had become essentially an enemy combatant. It was an odd choice ‚<U+0080><U+0094> one that would have made sense for Mr. Carmel‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Mudd, not the one that Mr. Wilson was inhabiting.This was also the episode that gave Sonequa Martin-Green the most to explore in Burnham. She is finally seen examining the parts of herself that aren‚<U+0080><U+0099>t dreary. Burnham is dancing! She has a crush on Tyler!I‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve always been hopeful about Shazad Latif‚<U+0080><U+0099>s casting as Tyler. He is charismatic, a direct contrast to Burnham. Healthy romances bring out the best in each other, so perhaps Tyler can be a vehicle for Ms. Martin-Green to continue to expand her character.We should pause and address the hot fan theory going around the Internet.Skip the italicized text below if you don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to read a fan theory.I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure I buy the theory that Tyler is a Klingon spy or our old friend Voq, because it would allow the Klingons a level of sophistication that thus far has not existed. This theory stems from a couple pieces of evidence in the show so far: that Lorca rescued Tyler from the Klingon ship, even though it wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t 100 percent clear that Mudd was the one selling them out and that Tyler had been kept alive on this ship longer than a typical prisoner would have. Lorca, not Starfleet, conducts a background check on Tyler. And then there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s the question of Voq‚<U+0080><U+0099>s whereabouts. He was last seen perusing through a Federation ship for its secrets. If Tyler is indeed Voq, it will feel a bit cheap to me.This marks the end of the fan theory section. 1. Stamets as Bill MurrayAnthony Rapp seems to have found the middle ground between Mean Stamets and Mycelium-High Stamets. I especially found him charming in predicting what Burnham was going to say after numerous time loops. All we needed was Stamets was to say to Burnham, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m a God! I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m a God. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not THE God, I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think.‚<U+0080>ù1. Why are we partying?! When we last left off, Admiral Cornwell (the subject of another fan theory!), was captured by the Klingons. The Discovery is still the only ship that can travel anywhere in the galaxy at a moment‚<U+0080><U+0099>s notice. This doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be an ideal time to throw a party. Also, there is no mention of Cornwell the entire episode, so there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s that.2. Burnham‚<U+0080><U+0099>s secretReally? Burnham never having been in love is the deep secret she passed on to Stamets? Even I knew that. She‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a human that was raised on Vulcan, where suppressing emotions is a foundational part of living there. I would have found it strange for her to have been in love, frankly. A better secret would have been: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>When I committed mutiny, I enjoyed it,‚<U+0080>ù or ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I would‚<U+0080><U+0099>ve rather joined a Gin Blossoms tribute band instead of Starfleet.‚<U+0080>ùSteven Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s new movie, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù is an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller about a woman who is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. From one angle, it plays like an old-school exploitation flick, one of those damsel-in-distress freakouts in which an intrepid heroine faces down danger in a skin-baring top. This being Mr. Soderbergh, peril isn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t sloppily served up with flat line readings, jiggling breasts and lousy cinematography but delivered with slyness and jolts.Sawyer ‚<U+0080><U+0094> an excellent, febrile Claire Foy, best known for playing Queen Elizabeth II on the Netflix series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Crown‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> is a new arrival in a generic city. She doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t say much about herself, but Mr. Soderbergh, a fast, efficient worker, fills in Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s life with quick, grim strokes ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a dire cubicle, nosy co-workers, a predatory boss ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and then he lets her out to play. This proves bleaker still. She hooks up with a stranger but when they end up in her apartment she flees to her bathroom. The prescription pills in her cabinet suggest there‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a reason she has fled, and a dark back story emerges piecemeal.Sawyer goes to a hospital to speak with a counselor, revealing that she was a victim of stalking before relocating. This earnest confession leads to her being locked up ‚<U+0080><U+0094> ostensibly because she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a suicide risk ‚<U+0080><U+0094> at first for 24 hours. Bad choices and violent encounters extend her stay, which grows progressively more frightening. The chick in the next bed, Violet (Juno Temple, persuasively feral), keeps harassing Sawyer, though Sawyer is given a friendly welcome by another inmate, Nate (a sympathetic, egregiously badly lighted Jay Pharoah). Then one day while lining up for her meds, Sawyer meets David (a terrific, utterly creepy Joshua Leonard), whom she claims is her stalker.Written by James Greer and Jonathan Bernstein, the movie plays out as an extended game of cat-and-mouse. Despite some teasing it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s who and what‚<U+0080><U+0099>s what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks. Mostly, Sawyer insists that she doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t belong in the hospital but doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t help her case ‚<U+0080><U+0094> she makes one mistake and then another, and consistently refuses to play the good girl ‚<U+0080><U+0094> which prolongs her incarceration and torment. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s easy to get how rotten she feels, especially given that Mr. Soderbergh keeps pushing his camera into Ms. Foy‚<U+0080><U+0099>s face.Mr. Soderbergh shot ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù primarily on iPhones using additional lenses, including a fish-eye. (He shot it using the name Peter Andrews, which are his father‚<U+0080><U+0099>s first two names; he also edited it, borrowing his mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s maiden name, Mary Ann Bernard.) Big budget or on the cheap, like here, he is a great shooter and he plays with perspective inventively, distorting the edges of the image so they bulge out, a warping that dovetails with Sawyer‚<U+0080><U+0099>s disturbed, disturbing world. At times, the distortion skews bluntly comic as when, after she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s committed, Sawyer sits at a table partly obscured by an absurdly large coffee mug that looms in the frame like a threat (or a wee monolith).Moments like this ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and the presence of actors like Amy Irving (‚<U+0080><U+009C>Carrie‚<U+0080>ù) ‚<U+0080><U+0094> suggest that Mr. Soderbergh had fun making ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane,‚<U+0080>ù but too little pleasure has seeped into the rest of the movie. He fills the frame with tension and meaning, showcasing a madhouse of blue-and-white chinoiserie and a deep-blue forest that foreshadows a padded cell. But the palette is often as dingy as the sets, which fits the story but is hard on the eyes. What seduces are the hypnotic images of Sawyer walking the hospital halls as if she were in a loop or retracing Shelley Duvall‚<U+0080><U+0099>s footsteps in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Shining,‚<U+0080>ù another film that meaningfully uses wide-angle lenses in constricted spaces.Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s quick-and-dirty approach works here better as a conceptual gambit than as an entertainment. What keeps you watching even as the story becomes more off-putting are the actors and Mr. Soderbergh‚<U+0080><U+0099>s filmmaking. It helps, too, if you ignore the woman-in-peril clich√©s and sadism and just read ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unsane‚<U+0080>ù as a self-aware riff on the relationship between critics and creators. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s worth noting that the very first thing in the movie is the sound of crickets. The insect whirring would make an appropriate soundtrack for a country scene, but the glass and concrete crowding our heroine place us in a city. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Crickets‚<U+0080>ù is slang for critics, but maybe the movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoid vibe is just contagious.Whatever the case, these point-of-view shots of Sawyer, which shift while framing her through foliage, suggest that she is being spied on by a Peeping Tom. (That women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s paranoia is often justified, including in movies, dilutes some of the suspense.) Later, when David earnestly tells Sawyer that he has always loved her, or at least the woman he has fetishized, he sounds like a demented fan, voicing whiny disappointment about betrayal. Sawyer rightly, harshly, puts him in his place. Yet needy, nutty David doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand. He wants what he wants. And, as he continues hammering Sawyer for not living up to his expectations it is a reminder that why, yes, everyone really is a critic.The inhabitants of the derelict mansion in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Lodgers‚<U+0080>ù don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get out much. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s some time around World War I in rural Ireland and the orphaned Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and her twin brother, Edward (an effective Bill Milner), are struggling in the family manor, an art-directed ruin cloaked in shadows and mystery. Edward stays inside, turning paler and weirder, but Rachel sometimes ventures out, occasionally putting on a black riding hood (the better to scare you) to visit a nearby village. She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.The twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin‚<U+0080><U+0099>s script, the director Brian O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares. These come intermittently and generally when you expect them, whether Rachel is dashing through the darkening forest or taking one of those candlelit soaks in the tub that women in storybook peril indulge in.Things steadily go from eerie to worse with the approach of the twins‚<U+0080><U+0099> birthday, an occasion that Rachel seems to fear far more than Edward does. (Something wicked this way trundles.) And, as Edward sulks and lurks in the house, his pale face flickering in the gloom like a guttering candle, Rachel brings a little life and a few people into the proceedings. During one of her outings, she catches the eye of Sean (Eugene Smith), newly returned home from the war, who unwisely maintains faith in pretty women and his own heroism.Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚<U+0080><U+0099>Malley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.In time, the monsters come out to play, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a measure of this movie‚<U+0080><U+0099>s insistently fright-free storytelling that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re nowhere as disturbing as Mr. Milner‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Edward. He‚<U+0080><U+0099>s one feral twitch away from Renfield in the 1931 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dracula,‚<U+0080>ù as the family‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lawyer (David Bradley, a welcome, wry presence) discovers during a very unwise visit.CREVE COEUR, Mo. ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Anheuser-Busch heir William Busch has been cited with assault after intervening in an altercation between his son and a fellow sixth-grader at a basketball practice in suburban St. Louis, according to police.The 58-year-old Busch allegedly grabbed an 11-year-old student and pushed him into a wall in November at the gym at Chaminade College Preparatory School in Creve Coeur, police said in statement released Saturday. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that other adults separated Busch and the child after the incident. Police said the child told investigators he wasn't injured.Busch, the great-grandson of Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch, received a summons for fourth-degree assault, a municipal ordinance violation.His attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said Busch intervened after school personnel failed to react when his son was ""bullied ‚<U+0080><U+0094> actually sucker-punched ‚<U+0080><U+0094> by a much larger middle school student directly in front of him.""The father of the other boy said Busch's son was the initial aggressor and that school and basketball officials ""acted swiftly and decisively in calming the situation,"" including removing Busch and his son from the facility.His son told police the scuffle began when the younger Busch pushed him two or three times, then raised his arm and a closed fist, according to a police report. After the boy slapped the younger Busch, the elder Busch approached him ""from behind and began shouting profanities,"" according to the report. The boy said Busch grabbed his shirt collar, pushing him backward, and a scuffle ensued.A social worker contacted police after the incident, which was captured on the school's security cameras and anonymously reported to the Missouri School Violence Hotline.The elder Busch, who never worked for Anheuser-Busch, has had other scrapes with the law. In 1981, prosecutors declined to press charges after he allegedly bit off another man's earlobe during a late-night brawl outside a tavern. Busch, then 22, told police the other man started the fight.___Information from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.comDALLAS ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Seattle Seahawks released quarterback Trevone Boykin on Tuesday shortly after his girlfriend alleged in a television interview that he physically assaulted her in Texas last week.The practice squad player was released from the team after WFAA-TV in Dallas posted an interview with Boykin's girlfriend detailing an assault she alleges happened on March 20 in Mansfield, just southwest of Dallas. The woman said she refused to show Boykin a text message and an argument ensued, and that he broke her jaw and tried to strangle her.Boykin, 24, denied the allegations in a statement released Tuesday to NFL Media. He called the allegations false and said he wasn't involved in a physical fight.""This woman has lied about me and it has cost me my job,"" he wrote. ""I understand the Seahawks decision to release me. The story that was reported casts a bad light on the organization and on me.""Boykin's agent, Drew Pittman, also told WFAA that the allegations were false. A call to the agent's cellphone by The Associated Press went unanswered Tuesday.Mansfield police spokesman Sgt. Michael Midkiff said the department is investigating the alleged assault. He said no charges had been filed as of Tuesday and that the investigation was in a very early stage.The assault allegation is the latest off-field issue for Boykin, who has spent his NFL career with Seattle.He was arrested in Dallas last year when a vehicle he was a passenger in hit several people on a sidewalk. He fled the scene on foot but was later arrested on misdemeanor charges of public intoxication and possession of marijuana.In 2015, Boykin was arrested for assaulting a police officer and public intoxication shortly before the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio during his senior season at TCU. Boykin, who was the team's quarterback, was suspended for the bowl game.___Associated Press Sports Writer Tim Booth contributed to this report from Seattle.BOSTON ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  A state senator's husband was indicted Thursday on charges of sexual assault, distributing nude photos without consent and criminal lewdness.The indictment of Bryon Hefner, the husband of Democratic Sen. Stanley Rosenberg, came months after The Boston Globe reported on allegations that Hefner sexually harassed or abused several men, some of whom had business before the Legislature.Prosecutors said Hefner sexually assaulted three victims between 2014 and 2016. They said he also obtained nude and partially nude photos of another victim without that victim's knowledge and sent or showed the photos to other people.""Today's indictments on multiple felony charges send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,"" Democratic state Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. ""I want to thank the victims who have come forward and put their trust in us.""Hefner's attorney said he ""intends to plead not guilty and looks forward to contesting the evidence and confronting the witnesses against him in a court of law.""Hefner is set to be arraigned on April 24 in Suffolk Superior Court, prosecutors said.Rosenberg, who is separated from Hefner, said these are ""serious charges.""""They are now being handled by the judicial system,"" he said in a statement. ""I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.""Rosenberg, who's in his late 60s, announced in January that he had separated from Hefner, who's 30, and that Hefner had entered treatment for alcohol dependency.Democratic state Senate President Harriette Chandler, who replaced Rosenberg as president, called the charges ""deeply disturbing.""""Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the District Attorney and Attorney General's Office,"" she said in a statement.A spokeswoman for Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, both Republicans, said they ""commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.""The initial reports that several men had accused Hefner of sexual assault or harassment sent the chamber into turmoil late last year, resulting in Rosenberg's decision to step down.The Senate Ethics Committee voted to hire a Boston law firm to independently investigate whether Rosenberg violated any Senate rules in connection with the allegations. That probe is ongoing.Rosenberg, a state senator since 1991, had initially hoped to return as president once the investigation was completed, but pressure mounted on senators to move on after the Globe subsequently reported that Hefner had involved himself in matters before the Senate. That included having access to Rosenberg's email account, despite Rosenberg's earlier promise to keep a ""firewall"" between his professional and personal lives.A lawyer for Hefner said at the time that Hefner ""did not have independent access to his husband's official email.""Rosenberg has repeatedly said that Hefner did not influence his actions and decisions as Senate president.Rosenberg assumed the top leadership post in January 2015. He was the first openly gay leader of either legislative chamber in Massachusetts.Democratic state Sen. Karen Spilka last week announced that she had secured commitments from enough of her colleagues to become the next Senate president, essentially ending any hope of Rosenberg's return as president. Rosenberg continues to serve as senator.When Chandler, who's 80, took over after Rosenberg's decision to step down, she said she intended to serve as president only through the remainder of this year.___Associated Press writers Bob Salsberg and Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.OKLAHOMA CITY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed Wednesday that it is looking into a lawsuit's allegations that a middle school student was sexually assaulted and threatened by classmates over 18 months and that school officials did nothing to stop the attacks.The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Oklahoma City by the now 14-year-old boy and his parents, alleges that Superintendent A.J. Brewer and Principal Stuart McPherson of Washington Public Schools, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City treated the assaults as ""horseplay"" or ""accidental touching.""The OSBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations should be finished soon, according to spokeswoman Jessica Brown.""We should have our reports completed in a few weeks. We will then hand it over to the district attorney. The DA will then determine how to proceed,"" and whether criminal charges are warranted, Brown said.School attorney Andy Fugitt said Wednesday that he was aware of the lawsuit but that he could not comment on pending litigation.Under Oklahoma law, anyone who suspects a child under the age of 18 is being abused is required to report the suspicion to the state's Department of Human Services.According to the lawsuit, DHS was notified of the allegations in May 2017, and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation began investigating in November at the request of the Washington Police Department.DHS spokeswoman Sheree Powell said the agency is prohibited by state and federal law from confirming any investigation.""We don't or confirm investigations involving particular allegations or individuals,"" Powell said.The lawsuit comes after four former football players in the Tulsa suburb of Bixby were previously charged with sexually assaulting a teammate that prosecutors said wasn't promptly reported.The four have pleaded not guilty and their attorneys have asked that the each be certified as juveniles.An Associated Press investigation published in 2017 examined sexual violence in school sports as part of a larger look at student-on-student sex assaults. The investigation found that team sexual assault is often mischaracterized as hazing and bullying and that the violence is so normalized that it persists for years, as players attacked one season become aggressors the next.MILWAUKEE ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  The family of two sexual assault victims says a television ad that alludes to their case to attack a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate is hurtful and should be removed from the air.The TV spot airing across Wisconsin involves a 2011 case in which Milwaukee County Judge Rebecca Dallet sentenced the victims' attacker to two years in prison instead of giving him the maximum 20-year-sentence, according to the ad.A family member of the victims ‚<U+0080><U+0094> who were 13 and 8 ‚<U+0080><U+0094> told WTMJ-TV the ad uses enough detail from the case to reveal their identities.""It's shameful, it's hurtful and I just need these ads to be taken down,"" said the family member, who asked for anonymity from WTMJ-TV.The Associated Press and many news organizations typically do not identify sexual assault victims.The ad is paid for by the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce Issues Mobilization Council, which supports Dallet's opponent, Sauk County Judge Michael Screnock. His campaign is not responsible for the ad and is not affiliated with the group.The race is officially nonpartisan but Republicans and right-leaning groups such as business are generally supporting Screnock while Democrats and groups such as Planned Parenthood are backing Dallet. The election is Tuesday.The manufacturers group said in a statement that the public should know about Dallet's record and that the ad ""merely repeats publicly available information from public records and information that has already been reported on by several news organizations.""""In fact, the state's largest newspaper reported on Judge Dallet's light sentence in this case earlier this year,"" the statement said. The statement did not address whether the group would consider taking down the ad or how long it will be broadcast.The Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said in a statement that the ad ""disgracefully identifies the relationship of the offender to his victim."" The DA's office said they learned about the ad from the victims' family.Tuesday's election is nonpartisan on paper but Dallet is liberal and Screnock is conservative. The court is currently controlled 5-2 by conservatives.Dallet's campaign said they've had no contact with the victims' family.""It is heartbreaking to see the pain this family is experiencing because of this attack ad,"" Dallet said in a statement.Screnock spokesman Sean Lansing said in a statement that Screnock's sole campaign ad has been positive and that a group supporting Dallet has also run negative ads attacking Screnock's work as a judge on similar cases.""I would also note that as a sitting judge and a candidate for our state's highest court, it would be inappropriate for Judge Screnock to comment on the validity of third party issue ads since this is a topic that is regularly debated and litigated and could very well make its way to the high court,"" Langsing said.___This story has been corrected to reflect the correct spelling of Screnock spokesman Sean Lansing's last name.SYDNEY ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Australia's rugby sevens captain James Stannard was ruled out of the Commonwealth Games with a fractured skull following a 'one-punch' attack in Sydney early on Friday after a farewell dinner for departing coach Andy Friend.New South Wales Police said in a statement that a 22-year-old man had been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after a 35-year-old man had been punched in an alleged ""unprovoked"" attack.Rugby Australia (RA) later identified Stannard as the victim of the attack and said he was in hospital with a fractured skull.""He's not available for the Commonwealth Games and that's obviously a massive disappointment for all of us and James and his family,"" RA high performance manager Ben Whitaker told reporters in Sydney.""We know that right now he needs some time to heal ... and then once that's sorted, we'll look at how he can return to play.""RA said Stannard and a group of players and team management had been at a fast-food outlet following the dinner for Friend when the alleged attack occurred.Two players in the squad, including regular captain Lewis Holland, and Friend detained the man shortly afterwards and held him until police arrived, RA said.Friend was told earlier this month that his contract with the team would not be renewed in July, but RA said they hoped he would remain with the wider organisation.Australia's women's Olympic gold-medal winning coach Tim Walsh will replace Friend after next month's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.""We had an organised function to celebrate and recognise the role Andy Friend has played with the team,"" Whitaker added.""Family and friends, players, staff all gathered for dinner and went out afterwards.""They were all together and there was management involved the whole night, so it was a very civilised, organised event.""Stannard had replaced the injured Holland as captain for the tournament.The men's tournament will be held on the final two days of the April 4-15 Games, with Australia drawn in Pool B with Samoa, Jamaica and England.(Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford/Amlan Chakraborty)MANSFIELD, Texas ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  Former TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin was arrested Wednesday at his North Texas home and charged with aggravated assault after his girlfriend accused him of beating her severely at his home.Boykin was arrested at his Mansfield, Texas, home after Mansfield police reviewed footage of a March 21 incident captured by Boykin's security video system, according to a police statement.He's been booked into the Mansfield city jail and remains without bond, pending arraignment.The Seattle Seahawks released Boykin from its practice squad Tuesday after WFAA-TV in Dallas posted an interview with Boykin's girlfriend in which she alleged he broke her jaw.Boykin, 24, has denied the allegations, and his agent Drew Pittman told the station the allegations are false. Calls to Pittman by The Associated Press went unanswered Wednesday.The assault allegation is the latest off-field issue for Boykin, who has spent his NFL career with Seattle.He was arrested in Dallas last year when a vehicle he was a passenger in hit several people on a sidewalk. He fled the scene on foot but was later arrested on misdemeanor charges of public intoxication and possession of marijuana.In 2015, Boykin was arrested for assaulting a police officer and public intoxication shortly before the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio during his senior season at TCU. Boykin, who was the team's quarterback, was suspended for the bowl game.SAN ANTONIO ‚<U+0080><U+0094>  In October of 2016, not long after a sexual assault scandal at Baylor swept out the football coach, athletic director and president of the university, the NCAA convened a commission to combat campus sexual violence.The commission crafted a policy focused on educating athletes and coaches and ensuring athletic departments were following school policies regarding the handling of sexual assault allegations. The commission's proposal was adopted by the NCAA board of governors last year .Since then, Michigan State has become embroiled in a horrific scandal involving a former athletic department doctor, Larry Nassar, who has been convicted of molesting dozens of women, including many Spartans athletes.NCAA leaders see the association as an agent of culture change, trying to curb a problem that goes beyond athletics. Others want the NCAA to take a more active role, putting rules in place that would ban individual offenders from competing in college athletics and sanction schools that fail to weed out potential predators. That is highly unlikely.""This is a systemic issue in society and certainly on campuses regardless of whether it's student-athletes or not,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Thursday at the Alamodome, site of Saturday's Final Four. ""On that score, the NCAA and the Board of Governors in particular have been more engaged than any other higher education entity. In fact, we're providing leadership to the rest of higher ed right now on trying to figure out how to deal with these issues in advance and prevent them, rather than just always coming in after the fact and imposing some kind of punishment or solutions afterwards.""Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor and activist who speaks to college sports teams all over the country, is part of the NCAA's commission to combat campus sexual assault. Tracy was encouraged by the passing of the commission's recommendations by NCAA Board of Governors in August . But she is pushing for an NCAA ban on athletes who commit sexual violence.""I don't feel like anyone should be banned from their education,"" Tracy said. ""But I do think that playing sports is absolutely a privilege and not a right. It's a privilege to be an NCAA athlete. To be a scholarship athlete.""Tracy said because of the prestige that goes with being an athlete, especially in high-profile sports such as football and basketball, they have more influence on campus.""And so we have a duty and a responsibility to make sure we're driving conversations that effect attitudes and beliefs and how we view these issues correctly,"" she said. ""And we're not. We're basically saying if you can run fast enough and throw a ball and make enough money for a school or a sports program then you can do whatever you want. You can break a woman's face. You can stomp her. You can rape her. You can do whatever you want as long as you're a good enough athlete. And that's wrong.""And so I also talk to them about, you know, what about attaching eligibility to behavior. You attach it to grades. Why can't we say sexual assault is not OK. Domestic violence is not OK.""For the NCAA, stepping into the area of what it refers to as individual accountability is complicated territory.""You quickly recognize that there are other entities that hold individuals accountable for criminal acts per se or even for violations of Title IX on specific campuses when investigations are completed,"" NCAA chief legal officer Don Remy said. ""And so as we have looked at this we have looked at our role as composed of all of higher education. And how can we in college athletics be part of the higher education dialogue to change the culture. And how can we make sure that student-athletes are treated the same as students who are on campus who don't compete in athletics. Not to create any preferential treatment for student-athletes or to create a negative environment for student-athletes, but to have student-athletes be able to matriculate through their time on campus like other students who aren't competing in athletics.""Kathy Redmond, founder of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, said at the heart of the problem is athletes are often given preferential treatment and protection by athletic programs, boosters and even local enforcement when they are accused of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. Redmond called the sexual violence policy the NCAA passed last year a ""check-the-box"" measure.""But when it comes down to it, the individual players know that the system will work for them,"" she said.Redmond said the NCAA should use a proposal crafted by the Drake Group , a watchdog for college sports, to guide policy on sexual violence committed by athletes.Tracy would like the NCAA to adopt a policy similar to the one Indiana University implemented last year, which bans its teams from accepting any athletes with a documented history of sexual or domestic violence. IU's policy was inspired by a similar one implemented by the Southeastern Conference regarding transfers.Though Indiana athletic director Fred Glass said: ""We didn't implement it to be like a trailblazer or pulling people toward this policy.""Laws differ from state to state, down to definitions of sexual assault. A one-size fits all NCAA policy that bans athletes with past transgressions would be difficult to craft and possibly vulnerable to legal challenges.""What is that a life sentence?"" said Cleveland-based attorney Susan Stone, who represented Ma'Lik Richmond, the Youngstown State football player convicted of rape in juvenile court when he was in high school.Campus backlash prompted Youngstown State to ban Richmond from playing last season. He sued the school, which had no policy like Indiana's. The school settled and lifted the ban.""There needs to be some thought before you ostracize students,"" Stone said.Tracy said she is not just looking to punish wrongdoers.""We're not just failing survivors, but we're also failing these young men, too,"" she said. ""Especially with our athletes the way we place entitlement on them from a young age. The way we set them up for failure by protecting them from everything. All this stuff that we do with our athletes, we're not helping them.""___Follow Ralph D.

It was widely mocked then, but similar policies have since spread to campuses nationwide, and today, the concept is acknowledged well beyond university grounds.Now, apps aiming to help partners mitigate confusion in the bedroom have emerged, the newest of which approaches consent like a legal contract. LegalFling, which was introduced to users in beta on Monday, lets users give explicit sexual consent via an agreement, or a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>live contract,‚<U+0080>ù a dynamic document that users can continuously interact with and update.And yes, these agreements could hold up in court, said Andrew D. Cherkasky, a former special victims prosecutor who now handles dozens of felony-level sexual assault cases each year as a criminal defense attorney. He emphasized, however, that what LegalFling offers are not technically contracts, but documentations of intent, which are legally viable.LegalFling aims to make the sexual dos and don‚<U+0080><U+0099>ts explicit in a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fun and clear way,‚<U+0080>ù according to its website.Condom use, bondage, dirty talk, sexting: the app lets users set their boundaries before an encounter ‚<U+0080><U+0094> boundaries that can be adjusted at any time with a tap and shared with a potential partner. (Sound familiar? Netflix‚<U+0080><U+0099>s twisted-tech series ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Black Mirror‚<U+0080>ù incorporated a similar transaction in its episode ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Hang the DJ.‚<U+0080>ù)‚<U+0080><U+009C>A profile update is an event we store on the blockchain and will subsequently update the live contract,‚<U+0080>ù Rick Schmitz, a co-creator of LegalFling, recently said. The transaction is encrypted, timestamped and stored. (A blockchain is a collection of digital transactions that are registered in a sequence of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>blocks‚<U+0080>ù of data.)Will these apps revolutionize sex? Not likely. As complex human beings with ever-changing desires, we may not fit so neatly into click-and-consent existence portrayed in that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Black Mirror‚<U+0080>ù episode, or envisioned by the app developers. But they are making steps toward addressing a problem that needs solving.Dr. Michelle Drouin, a leading expert on technology and relationships, said the apps are good at documenting consent, but don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t account much for fluctuating human emotions. They don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily allow for any immediacy of one‚<U+0080><U+0099>s feelings, she said.Use of the app ‚<U+0080><U+009C>has to be planned,‚<U+0080>ù she said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s really difficult for us to even know how we feel in the present moment, much less trying to anticipate how we might feel an hour from now.‚<U+0080>ùMr. Schmitz said that a LegalFling agreement does not override someone changing his or her mind in the moment or being too intoxicated, for example, to consent. The company suggests you withdraw consent via the app at that moment, but, of course, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not always possible.If encounters leave users feeling violated, Mr. Schmitz said, they should notify the aggressor afterward in a message, and it will be added to the record.Also possible with a tap: triggering cease-and-desist letters, according to the website.The creators of LegalFling, part of the blockchain company LegalThings, which digitized regulation for the Dutch government, said they decided to apply their technology to sexual consent when, in December, Sweden proposed a law that would require people to get explicit verbal consent before sexual contact.But Dr. Drouin is not sold on apps as a solution to a very human problem. The requirement to interact with an app during a sexual encounter is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>completely unrealistic,‚<U+0080>ù she said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>It would be very awkward within the context of an intimate encounter to be like, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Wait a second, I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m changing my mind on the app and also with you,‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù she said.More important, she said, the app could persuade someone to fulfill acts simply because they agreed to them in advance, or to overcommit in an effort to appear more sexually adventurous.These digital agreements could certainly be used as evidence of, at the time the button was pushed, what an individual‚<U+0080><U+0099>s intent or desires were, according to Mr. Cherkasky. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We already see it all the time in social media or text messages,‚<U+0080>ù he said, adding that they would most likely be legally viable in cases globally, as well.But these agreements do have the potential to be used as a means of protection to an aggressor, he said, especially by a violent and premeditating criminal. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s very common in domestic violence cases for an attacker to have a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>great deal of power over the person and force them to do a number of things,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Even implying that someone doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t have the right to change their mind is a real risk, he said. Though the risk also exists for an accused person, who may have fully gotten consent in the moment even if ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the box wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t checked.‚<U+0080>ù‚<U+0080><U+009C>It turns consent into a joke, a technicality that people think is black and white or can be recorded in a moment of time,‚<U+0080>ù he said.But technology is reflecting a cultural shift in respecting and understanding the idea of consent, he said.Dr. Drouin agreed: People are now communicating about these incidents in ways that are recordable and admissible in court, she said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no longer ‚<U+0080><U+0098>he said, she said.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùWhile LegalFling is the newest app hoping to address the rising tide of consent awareness, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not the first. We-Consent, introduced in 2015 by the nonprofit Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence, was created for students on college campuses to help them adhere to the implementation of affirmative consent rules.In 2014, California became the first state to require colleges to use affirmative consent as the standard in disciplinary decisions, which inspired the creation of We-Consent, said Michael Lissack, director of the institute.We-Consent records a short video of two people stating their affirmative consent, according to the company, and uses facial recognition technology. That recording is encrypted and inaccessible without a legal petition.There are over 100,000 encrypted files, Mr. Lissack said, but the institute has had only two requests ever to retrieve the videos. In both instances ‚<U+0080><U+0094> before We-Consent turned in the videos ‚<U+0080><U+0094> the fact that they were available spurred the cases to settle, Mr. Lissack said.‚<U+0080><U+009C>From Day 1, the purpose of the app was to get people who are about do something to discuss what they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to do with one another,‚<U+0080>ù he said.Consent can happen only from discussion, he said, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>not from sending emoji back and forth, nodding your head or signing some weird legal agreement.‚<U+0080>ùSome sexual encounters are obviously consensual, while others are obviously not. But what about those that are neither black nor white? In the second episode in our series on sexual consent, the Sugars plunge deeper into the gray area.A woman who calls herself ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stuck in the Gray‚<U+0080>ù is still haunted by her first sexual encounter over a decade later. At age 22, she lost her virginity to her brother-in-law, who is 11 years her senior. The encounter had lasting repercussions on her sex life and her relationship with her family, especially her sister, her brother-in-law‚<U+0080><U+0099>s wife. Stuck in the Gray struggled to define the encounter for years and now she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s unable to conclude if it was consensual. She asks, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I a coward and a liar who‚<U+0080><U+0099>s hiding my accountability behind victimization? Or am I a victim?‚<U+0080>ùTHE SUGARS RECOMMEND‚<U+0080><U+009C>Stitches,‚<U+0080>ù by Antonya Nelson‚<U+0080><U+009C>Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?,‚<U+0080>ù by Joyce Carol OatesNew episodes of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dear Sugars‚<U+0080>ù are released weekly.

Over the course of a three-part series on consent, the Sugars answer letters from some of these women and explore the complexity and nuance of sexual consent.In this first episode of the series, we hear from two women who have opposing reactions to the #MeToo moment. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>How do I make the men in my life understand where women everywhere are coming from?‚<U+0080>ù asks one woman, adding, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>My blood boils when listening to their insensitive and wholly incorrect comments.‚<U+0080>ù Another woman asks: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In some cases, like the accusations against Louis C.K., I find myself feeling strangely defensive of the men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s behavior.

Ms. Friedman explains the cultural context behind both letters, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We train women to disappear ourselves, to make men‚<U+0080><U+0099>s desire more important than our own.‚<U+0080>ù And she offers a few solutions: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Part of the answer is that men who already understand this have to help other men along.‚<U+0080>ùMs. Friedman is the author of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World Without Rape‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unscrewed: Women, Sex, Power and How to Stop Letting the System Screw Us All.‚<U+0080>ù Her podcast, also called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Unscrewed,‚<U+0080>ù was named one of the Best Sex Podcasts by Marie Claire and Esquire.THE SUGARS RECOMMEND‚<U+0080><U+009C>Cat Person,‚<U+0080>ù by Kristen Roupenian‚<U+0080><U+009C>Bad Stories: What the Hell Just Happened to Our Country,‚<U+0080>ù by Steve AlmondNew episodes of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Dear Sugars‚<U+0080>ù are released weekly.

Jackson, the top civil rights official in Donald Trump‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Department of Education, told The New York Times that 90 percent of campus rape allegations come from women who regret drunken consensual sex. (She later apologized for her ‚<U+0080><U+009C>flippant‚<U+0080>ù remarks.) The day after Jackson made this claim, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, met with groups representing students who say they were falsely accused of sexual assault, including the National Coalition for Men Carolinas. (Says a banner on the group‚<U+0080><U+0099>s website: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be THAT girl: Embarrassed by a hookup? Angry at a boyfriend? Willing to lie to destroy a life?‚<U+0080>ù)Before the month was over, Columbia University announced that it had settled a lawsuit brought by Paul Nungesser, who became infamous after being accused of rape by Emma Sulkowicz, a fellow student. In 2014, outraged by how Columbia had handled her sexual assault claim against Nungesser, Sulkowicz began lugging a mattress around campus for an entire school year, an iconic piece of protest art that served as her senior thesis. Nungesser‚<U+0080><U+0099>s suit alleged that Columbia, by enabling Sulkowicz‚<U+0080><U+0099>s project, abetted ‚<U+0080><U+009C>gender-based harassment‚<U+0080>ù against him. Sulkowicz‚<U+0080><U+0099>s case was emblematic of the movement to use civil rights law to combat campus rape, but in the end the law offered redress to her accused rapist. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s an irony appropriate to the Trump-era backlash against what his supporters perceived as the far-reaching anti-campus rape policies that took hold during Barack Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s presidency.Vanessa Grigoriadis did most of the reporting for her sometimes fascinating but often frustrating new book, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power and Consent on Campus,‚<U+0080>ù during the Obama years, when the movement against campus rape was ascendant. Now as the book is released, the movement is on the defensive. This actually makes the subject of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines‚<U+0080>ù more relevant rather than less. Every empirical claim about campus rape is under ferocious dispute: There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s no consensus about what constitutes sexual assault on campus, how common it is or how it should be prevented. In this confusing climate, a cleareyed elucidation of the murky campus rape phenomenon would be enormously welcome. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines‚<U+0080>ù aims to be that book, but is too sloppy with the facts to succeed.Grigoriadis, a contributing editor at The Times Magazine and Vanity Fair, is terrific at capturing complicated personalities and subtle social dynamics. Her kaleidoscopic tour through the campus sexual assault controversy, which begins and ends with Sulkowicz, introduces readers to rape victims-turned-activists, faux-worldly sorority sisters, young men who say their lives were destroyed by false accusations and the college administrators struggling to enforce rapidly changing rules and norms. Grigoriadis puts in the time with students to get them to open up to her, and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines‚<U+0080>ù shows us the parts of their world that defy easy sloganeering.From the outside, that world looks brutal, at least for young women who have internalized the idea that empowerment means mastering a coldly performative sexuality. At one point, a radical feminist at Wesleyan University admits her dislike of pornography in a whisper, saying, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re not supposed to say you feel that way.‚<U+0080>ù It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s as if the only taboo desire is the desire for sexual taboos.A female Georgetown University graduate gives a heartbreaking account of how hookups boost her confidence: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>In the moment, it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+0098>This guy thinks I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m hot, this guy thinks I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m special,‚<U+0080><U+0099> because the attention that a man gives you when he wants to have sex with you is the most singular and focused you can get him to be on you.‚<U+0080>ùGrigoriadis also spends hours with students who claim to have been falsely accused, as well as with their crusading parents. She starts to sympathize with them, but is brought up short by a young man expressing bitterness at being punished for rape without actually getting to rape anyone. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Man, I wish I could have gotten some of that sexual assault,‚<U+0080>ù he says. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Not really violent sexual assault, but I wish I could have done the sort of borderline.‚<U+0080>ù Suddenly, he doesn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t seem so innocent anymore. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines‚<U+0080>ù is at its most compelling when we see Grigoriadis discovering the ambiguities in the stories she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s covering and recalibrating her own assumptions in response.But when Grigoriadis moves away from individual dramas to broad cultural pronouncements, the book falters. Occasionally she makes baffling errors that threaten to undermine her entire book. In the introduction, she writes that universities ‚<U+0080><U+009C>have some of the highest rates of sexual assault in the country,‚<U+0080>ù and that when it comes to rape, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>the risk is college itself.‚<U+0080>ù Yet according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, women between 18 and 24 who are not in college are victimized at higher rates than those who are in college. Citing Department of Justice figures, the group says that college-aged women ‚<U+0080><U+009C>are 20 percent less likely than nonstudents of the same age to be a victim of rape or sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ùI‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure how anyone could write an entire book about the subject of campus rape and not reckon with this. Campus rape hasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t become a major political issue because college students are more vulnerable than their peers, but because they are more powerful, able to demand an institutional response to their traumas.Grigoriadis makes other puzzling statements as well. Sulkowicz‚<U+0080><U+0099>s 2014 mattress project, she writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>might fairly be considered the chief catalyst for campus anti-assault activism in its current form.‚<U+0080>ù Yet Obama‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Education Department issued its guidance on making campus rape adjudication more victim-friendly in 2011. End Rape on Campus, whose student founders were featured in the high-profile documentary ‚<U+0080><U+009C>The Hunting Ground,‚<U+0080>ù was created in 2013.Other inaccuracies are smaller, but still jarring. Grigoriadis speculates that sexual assault is part of a backlash against women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s increasing power, writing, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Guys might be asserting themselves in the bedroom because they can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t in other places.‚<U+0080>ù If that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s true, why has rape declined dramatically since the 1990s? Grigoriadis describes millennial women reclaiming the word ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bitch,‚<U+0080>ù a word, she writes, that ‚<U+0080><U+009C>women didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t use in the 1990s.‚<U+0080>ù The indie magazine Bitch: Feminist Response to Pop Culture was founded in 1996. She writes, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Every woman knows that when she has a miserable fight with a male lover, his usual parry is ‚<U+0080><U+0098>You‚<U+0080><U+0099>re such a bitch!‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù Perhaps I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m lucky, but this has never happened to me. Anyway, not every woman has male lovers.The mistakes in ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines‚<U+0080>ù offer easy justification to anyone who wants to dismiss it. In some ways this is too bad, because parts of it are powerful. Grigoriadis usefully unpacks the oft-quoted, oft-disputed figure that one in five women will be sexually victimized on campus, showing that the statistic is more solid than campus rape skeptics would admit. Yet while she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s sympathetic to the antirape movement, she‚<U+0080><U+0099>s also willing to challenge its shibboleths, describing cases in which the line between bad sex and sexual assault is in fact hard to discern. In one of the most interesting parts of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines,‚<U+0080>ù she reports on a strikingly successful Canadian risk-reduction program for women, and explains why it faces political resistance from American feminists who don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t think preventing rape should be women‚<U+0080><U+0099>s responsibility. This seems like an instance of ideology obscuring practical realities; would-be rapists will simply never have the same interest in stopping rape as would-be victims.But if you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re going to challenge people‚<U+0080><U+0099>s preconceptions, you have to have your facts straight. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Blurred Lines‚<U+0080>ù gives readers too many reasons not to trust it, even when perhaps they should.Over 20 years ago, I drove to the small liberal arts college Wesleyan University in my parents‚<U+0080><U+0099> station wagon, a microwave-size computer and a dot-matrix printer in the trunk. Equally renowned for its academics and its social life, boasting alums like Santigold and Lin-Manuel Miranda, Wesleyan was and is a bastion of radical politics. In the 1990s, the school even inspired a Jeremy Piven comedy about trendy Gen X liberalism (Save the whales! Meat is murder! Gays in the military now!). That film has long since been forgotten, but the first two letters are on the lips of all Americans today: ‚<U+0080><U+009C>PCU.‚<U+0080>ùLike many elite campuses, Wesleyan has more than doubled in price since then, with tuition and fees upward of $50,000 per year, and has been spit shined to brochure-worthy gloss. A sprawling $47 million student center has landed on the grounds, replacing a flying-saucer-shaped cafeteria with an affectionately remembered smoking area.Yet courtesy of the 20-year nostalgia cycle, the students who will be dragging their luggage up dorm staircases next week will look almost the same. The quad will be awash in Dr. Martens boots, black chokers, Converse sneakers and shoulder-slung mini-backpacks. And not only do these kids look similar, they also talk, urgently, about many of the same issues. Like sex, consensual and not.In the 1990s, my feminist friends and I had a fervent anti-sexual assault movement, including Take Back the Night marches down frat row and a list of guys to stay away from, furtively scribbled in a bathroom stall. We talked about sexual assault as an affront of the patriarchy, and universities did not like it. At Brown, originator of the bathroom list trend, an administrator smeared the authors as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Magic Marker terrorists‚<U+0080>ù and threatened them with expulsion if caught.As much as you may read about the angry cries of ‚<U+0080><U+009C>social justice warriors‚<U+0080>ù in current news, today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s students discuss sexual assault in a completely new way. Their primary concern is sexual ethics. Debates about what is consensual and what is not, what type of sex is fair and what is immoral, are essential to life at Wesleyan, I learned during visits to the campus a few semesters ago. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>There‚<U+0080><U+0099>s a difference between illegal and unethical,‚<U+0080>ù Chloe, a neuroscience major, told me, firmly. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Life is not about doing whatever you can do. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s about not doing what is traumatic to another person.‚<U+0080>ùWhat few older people see in today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s ‚<U+0080><U+009C>P.C.‚<U+0080>ù students is their overwhelming urge to be kind to each other. They may have spent their middle and high school years being bullied, or bullying others; for kids in their low-to-mid-teens, the internet is a bullying machine. But by college, their sense of morality has blossomed. And many adolescents want to sort the world categorically into good and bad, at once eager to draw boundaries and empathize with whatever others might possibly feel.Adults may make fun of trigger warnings, but most kids support them because they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re about extending a hand to others, undergirding an ethic of caring and decency. Calling out ‚<U+0080><U+009C>micro-aggressions‚<U+0080>ù among classmates and policing tone on social media appeal to them in much the same way. They don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t understand why older people deride their generation as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>crybullies,‚<U+0080>ù in the conservative publisher Roger Kimball‚<U+0080><U+0099>s words, or as ‚<U+0080><U+009C>fragile thugs,‚<U+0080>ù a phrase David Brooks, a New York Times columnist, has used.It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s like 1969 all over again, with smokeless vapes instead of gurgling bong hits; their stodgy, cynical, heartless parents won‚<U+0080><U+0099>t give peace a chance. Sensitive kids of all stripes have joined this movement, including the type of student who would have gone on tour with Phish in the 1990s, or those who listened to moody emo bands like Taking Back Sunday in the 2000s.Let‚<U+0080><U+0099>s chalk up these kids‚<U+0080><U+0099> snarky, furiously penned essays for campus newspapers and meanspirited social media posts to the internet‚<U+0080><U+0099>s mob mentality, a 20-year-old‚<U+0080><U+0099>s clumsiness with rhetorical flourishes, and their deep need to be part of a clique. Political radicalism at college is now more vocation than avocation, and anyone who displays a trace of racism, misogyny or sexual predation is suspect.In this climate, some people can become fiercely self-critical. One white male senior at Wesleyan, with luscious shoulder-length blond hair and wearing a prep‚<U+0080><U+0099>s cable-knit sweater, described his discomfort to me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I feel privileged, and I have a privilege,‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>And I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m fine with girls on campus saying I have a privilege! I apologize that I was born into this form, but I am living the best I can.‚<U+0080>ù He chuckled, but then looked genuinely pained. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not afraid to be me, but I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to come across as being insensitive.‚<U+0080>ùThis heightened ethical sensitivity is being applied to sexual intercourse, an activity whose standards have long been mutable and often lax. My mother‚<U+0080><U+0099>s generation, coming of age in the 1970s, imagined that when a woman went to a man‚<U+0080><U+0099>s apartment, she‚<U+0080><U+0099>d signaled her intent to have intercourse. Twenty years later, I thought I could walk out of that apartment without even an obligatory kiss, but I would never have lain down on a mattress with someone with whom I didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t plan to hook up. Today, inviting someone into your bed is ‚<U+0080><U+009C>cuddling,‚<U+0080>ù usually but not always sexual, and certainly does not have to lead to intercourse.These types of vague encounters most likely spurred the demand for some rules. Whereas my Gen X friends called weird, awkward and even predatory sexual experiences ‚<U+0080><U+009C>bad nights,‚<U+0080>ù today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s students use the label ‚<U+0080><U+009C>sexual assault.‚<U+0080>ù If it feels violating, it is violating, and shouldn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t be part of anyone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s formative sexual experiences.Notwithstanding the kind of talk that has come freely to the nation‚<U+0080><U+0099>s current president, at today‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Wesleyan a smack on the butt, a grab and kiss, and subjection to coercive speech like ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t feel anything with a condom on‚<U+0080>ù and ‚<U+0080><U+009C>just a couple strokes‚<U+0080>ù are considered potentially offensive and maybe actionable, often for the first time in history. Wesleyan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s students were also not so impressed by my Take Back the Night stories, I was wounded to discover. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>We don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t want to change one night, we want to change every night,‚<U+0080>ù one of them told me, emphatically.The much-mocked 1991 ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Antioch Rules,‚<U+0080>ù meanwhile, now seem prescient. At Wesleyan, as at many American universities today ‚<U+0080><U+0094> not only the Ivy League and some state universities, but other colleges in New York, California, Illinois and Connecticut ‚<U+0080><U+0094> students are expected to abide by some form of an ‚<U+0080><U+009C>affirmative consent‚<U+0080>ù standard, colloquially called ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yes means yes.‚<U+0080>ùSilence can no longer be considered consent for sex. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>No means no‚<U+0080>ù misses the important question. Getting busy must include a verbal ‚<U+0080><U+009C>yes‚<U+0080>ù or some sort of totally-impossible-to-misinterpret moan or groan or high-pitched scream of pleasure. Also, this must be secured before every sexual act, from kissing to going all the way.At some colleges, this way of having sex is considered ludicrous. At others, like Wesleyan, kids take it seriously. You can think of this the way they do ‚<U+0080><U+0094> a high-toned, righteous issue about sexual autonomy ‚<U+0080><U+0094> or as a novel courting ritual. It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s not that different from sending an emoji to clarify one‚<U+0080><U+0099>s meaning at the end of a text message.Most students ‚<U+0080><U+0094> and not only the type of aggressive liberal activist once called a ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Magic Marker terrorist‚<U+0080>ù ‚<U+0080><U+0094> like these standards, perceiving them as a way of making sex more pleasurable instead of less. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s attractive to me because he is showing me that he thinks I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m a person,‚<U+0080>ù said Karmenife, a talented writer from Harlem. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not this receptacle. I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not supposed to lie there and be his object. This is something that we‚<U+0080><U+0099>re doing together.‚<U+0080>ùOther students said the situation wasn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t so simple. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Sometimes it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s nice when guys ask more questions, sometimes it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s weird,‚<U+0080>ù said a 21-year-old female student. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Some men in college are way too scared now of potentially assaulting people. I hooked up with a friend who was very drunk, and I was not very drunk. I liked him. Afterward he didn‚<U+0080><U+0099>t like me. So I said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m upset, I liked you.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùThe young man reeled back, worrying that she was about to accuse him of assaulting her, not understanding that she was saying she was bummed he regarded the night as a drunken hookup and nothing more. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>He was very upset about his level of drunkenness, and ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Did I take advantage of you?‚<U+0080><U+0099> I said, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m not saying it was nonconsensual! I liked you.‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ù She added, in typical millennial patois, ‚<U+0080><U+009C>‚<U+0080><U+0098>You don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t get to be the one, all worried Did I rape you? I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m upset about you passing the friendship line, and you‚<U+0080><U+0099>re hyperventilating about your level of drunkenness!‚<U+0080><U+0099>‚<U+0080>ùAs with all social etiquette, some people will take rules too far. These new sexual standards appeal to the ever-present undergraduate elimination of ambiguity. The need to communicate constantly ‚<U+0080><U+0094> very millennial ‚<U+0080><U+0094> may also be a na√Øve belief in explicitness. Nothing should be beyond words, no liminal realms of discomfort can be allowed to exist. But we can‚<U+0080><U+0099>t lose sight of the fact that they‚<U+0080><U+0099>re also about compassion. They‚<U+0080><U+0099>re making sure that the desire of the other is present when gratifying oneself, an attunement to gratifying the other too.One Saturday afternoon, I stopped by a narrow, chartreuse-painted condo on the outskirts of town. A handful of Wesleyan soccer players were in their driveway, basking in the sun and marking asphalt with chalk for the childhood game four square (they were using a hacky sack as a ball ‚<U+0080><U+0094> hark, the 1990s!).Between chatter about the mechanical failure of someone‚<U+0080><U+0099>s Jeep, the relative merits of Wesleyan‚<U+0080><U+0099>s lacrosse team and who was going to get the keg, I asked them about consent. Do their friends get it in sexual situations? ‚<U+0080><U+009C>Um, that‚<U+0080><U+0099>s weird,‚<U+0080>ù a student from Toms River, N.J., said, giving me side-eye and laughing. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what my friends ask or don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t ask girls!‚<U+0080>ùBut an economics major from Idaho cradling a Miller Light took a seat beside me. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>On a personal level, I will always ask for consent ‚<U+0080><U+0094> always! Regardless!‚<U+0080>ù he said. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I say, ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Hey, is this O.K.? Are you O.K. with this?‚<U+0080><U+0099> It‚<U+0080><U+0099>s awkward, yeah, but it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s five seconds and it‚<U+0080><U+0099>s over. And if the girl goes to Wesleyan, she recognizes what I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m doing: I‚<U+0080><U+0099>m asking for consent.‚<U+0080>ùSoon one of his friends waved to him; it was his turn at four square. ‚<U+0080><U+009C>I don‚<U+0080><U+0099>t know what it will be like when I graduate from college, though,‚<U+0080>ù he said, tossing his beer into a garbage can like he was dunking a basketball.‚<U+0080><U+009C>Am I still supposed to ask?‚<U+0080>ù he said, walking away."
