business,advertisement by emily flitterfeb. 15  2018  u.s. bank  the fifth-largest commercial bank by assets in the united states  was charged by the federal authorities on thursday with failing to guard against illegal activity and  in at least one instance  even abetting it. the justice department accused u.s. bank  which is based in minneapolis  of severely neglecting anti-money laundering rules  helping a payday lender operate an illegal business and lying to a regulator about its plans for tracking potential criminal activity by bank customers. federal prosecutors in manhattan reached an agreement with u.s. bank to defer prosecution as long as the bank could show it had improved its monitoring of customer transactions. to settle the justice department charges and cases brought by other regulators  the bank agreed to pay various fines and penalties totaling $613 million. in a statement  the banks chief executive  andy cecere  said that u.s. bank had already made significant investments toward improving its program for combating money-laundering. advertisement our culture of ethics and integrity demands that we do better  he said. the action against u.s. bank was modest compared with cases involving banking giants like hsbc and standard chartered that the authorities found had done business with drug gangs and countries like cuba and iran that had been barred from the united states financial system under international sanctions. in 2012  for instance  federal prosecutors settled a money-laundering case against hsbc for $1.9 billion. advertisement unlike the earlier cases  the one involving u.s. bank focused mainly on warning signs that the bank was ignoring. for about five years  senior bank employees tried to balance their security systems constant alerts about suspicious customer activity against internal staffing limitations  the authorities said. in a late-2009 memo  court documents show  u.s. banks anti-money-laundering officer warned the chief compliance officer that employees responsible for investigating the alerts were stretched dangerously thin. but senior bank officials knew they should not be curtailing money-laundering inquiries just because they did not have enough employees  so they hid the practice from federal bank examiners  according to prosecutors. one u.s. bank employee left references to the staffing problem out of the minutes of internal meetings  fearful of what regulators would think  the justice department said. tests of the alert system were halted after they showed that the bank had failed to report suspicious customer activity to regulators.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. dana ripley  a u.s. bank spokesman  said that most of the senior employees involved in the practices at issue had left by 2014  when the bank overhauled its anti-money laundering program. jeffrey alberts  a former federal prosecutor who specializes in issues related to white-collar crime and bank regulation  said that scrutinizing potential criminal activity was a challenge for banks. theres no level of monitoring you can impose that will catch every single suspicious transaction  he said. mr. alberts  a partner in the law firm pryor cashman  said that banks often struggled to determine how precisely they needed to monitor customer transactions to satisfy regulators. nonetheless  he said after reviewing the charges  there are some things that are alleged here that sound clearly wrong. for example  prosecutors said the bank had failed to report strange behavior by one longtime customer  scott tucker  who was convicted in federal court in october of charges stemming from an illegal payday lending business he operated. according to the charges announced on thursday  the bank kept open numerous accounts controlled by mr. tucker even after it received a subpoena from regulators for information about him. mr. tucker was using corporate accounts whose ownership he misrepresented to pay for millions of dollars spent on personal items like a vacation home in aspen  colo.  and a ferrari racing team. the justice department did not identify individual u.s. bank employees in connection with the case. follow emily flitter on twitter: @flitteronfraud. a version of this article appears in print on february 16  2018  on page b5 of the new york edition with the headline: justice dept. charges u.s. bank with lapses in laundering oversight.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
business,advertisement by reutersapril 24  2018  9:19 a.m. e.d.t.  dakar   congo's state miner gecamines is starting legal proceedings to dissolve its kamoto copper and cobalt joint venture with a subsidiary of glencore  blaming the commodities giant for high debts that have weighed on the mine for more than 10 years. gecamines said on tuesday that debts owed by kamoto to glencore and its subsidiaries at the end of 2017 topped $9 billion. it said the commodities group charged the venture interest rates on loans that were too high. kamoto  one of democratic republic of congo's (drc) biggest copper and cobalt mines  is 75 percent controlled by katanga mining  in which glencore has an 86 percent stake. gecamines controls the remaining 25 percent. kinshasa is taking an increasingly confrontational stance towards foreign mining companies  including a new mining code passed last month that hikes royalties and taxes. advertisement gecamines said last year it planned to implement new controls to hold its joint venture partners accountable for poor financial performance at their mines. advertisement "through a series of intragroup financial and commercial agreements  the majority shareholders group implemented a policy that resulted in draining  to its own benefit  the treasury and the wealth of the joint company " gecamines said in a statement. a glencore spokesman declined to comment. katanga mining had said on sunday it opposed dissolving kamoto and was assessing options to address the mine's capital shortfall  including forgiving a portion of the debt. katanga said it had attempted to engage in talks with gecamines about recapitalising the kamoto mine but that the congolese company unilaterally launched legal proceedings.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. a court hearing on gecamines' petition to dissolve kamoto is scheduled for may 8 in congo. gecamines said in its statement that annual interest rates on kamoto's debts had reached 14 percent. it said glencore and its subsidiaries were able to borrow funds far more cheaply than the level at which it lent on to the venture. hsbc analysts were sanguine in a note on monday about the impact of gecamines' move  saying katanga had several options to recapitalise the mine that were unlikely to impact the company's assets  liabilities and net assets. however  elisabeth caesens  director of resource matters  a brussels-based group that advocates better resource management  said glencore and katanga could have more serious concerns. "congolese authorities have cancelled fully operational projects in the past in less troubling circumstances. the scenario whereby the drc court grants gecamines relief should not be ruled out completely " she told reuters. congo is africa's top copper producer and the world's leading miner of cobalt  a key ingredient in electric batteries  but gecamines is heavily indebted. shares in toronto-listed katanga lost half their value on monday in response to sunday's original announcement. advertisement (editing by edmund blair and mark potter) were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
business,advertisement  white collar watch  by peter j. henning  feb. 8  2016  abraham lincoln once said  let the people know the facts and the country will be safe. whether that view applies to disclosure of a corporate monitors report about hsbcs response to money laundering problems that resulted in a deferred prosecution agreement in 2012 is the focus of a dispute between the justice department and judge john gleeson of the federal district court in brooklyn. the question is whether the public has a right to see reports compiled by monitors  who were appointed at the governments insistence  about how well companies found to have violated the law are cleaning up their operations. the justice department filed charges against london-based hsbc in 2012  accusing the bank of failing to prevent money laundering by mexican drug cartels and hiding transfers made for clients in iran  sudan and cuba in violation of sanctions imposed on those countries. as part of the settlement  hsbc paid $1.92 billion and agreed to bring in an outside monitor for five years to ensure improved compliance with the law. prosecutors hailed the case as proof of the crackdown on miscreant banks. attorney general loretta e. lynch  the united states attorney in brooklyn at the time  said the agreement makes it clear that all corporate citizens  no matter how large  must be held accountable for their actions. advertisement but the decision to allow hsbc to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement rather than plead guilty  and the failure to charge any individuals at the bank  caused a firestorm of criticism. an editorial in the new york times blasted the resolution as a dark day for the rule of law because it showed that some banks were too big to indict. a lack of criminal prosecutions of banks and their leaders fueled a public outcry over the perception that wall street giants are too big to jail.             judge gleeson initially expressed reluctance to sign off on the deferred prosecution agreement  questioning whether it reflected the seriousness of the violations. nevertheless  he approved the settlement in july 2013  subject to the condition that the justice department and hsbc provide quarterly reports to keep the court apprised of any developments in the case. the monitor  michael cherkasky  filed a detailed report with prosecutors on hsbcs compliance last year that was submitted to the court under seal  which means it was not available to the public. according to bloomberg  there has been some resistance inside the bank to efforts to reform its operations that mr. cherkasky addresses. advertisement in november  an individual suing hsbc over a mortgage loan modification submitted a request to judge gleeson asking that the report be released. the justice department responded by arguing that the report should stay secret because its release would expose sensitive information about anti-money laundering efforts  claiming that disclosure would give criminals a road map to weaknesses in the hsbcs money laundering measures. the government also asserted that public disclosure would harm the monitors oversight because foreign regulators and bank employees who expected confidentiality would be less likely to cooperate in the future. judge gleeson was unpersuaded  stating at a hearing on jan. 15 that i cant for the life of me figure out why the sun shouldnt shine. he issued an opinion on jan. 28 ordering the release of the report  subject to redaction of sensitive information to avoid the problems identified by the government. he found that the public has a first amendment right to see documents filed with the court  pointing out that his oversight of the deferred prosecution agreement goes to the heart of the publics right of access.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the justice department asked judge gleeson on thursday to stay his order so that it can appeal his decision. the order is likely to prompt similar requests for disclosure of reports by other monitors appointed as part of a deferred prosecution agreement based on the first amendment right recognized by judge gleeson. for example  general motors resolved charges related to faulty ignition switches by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement that required the company to pay $900 million and appoint a monitor who will make periodic reports to the justice department about the progress in addressing safety issues. judge gleesons decision raises a more fundamental question about how much involvement the courts should have over settlements related to corporate wrongdoing. in a civil case  judge jed s. rakoff of the federal district court in manhattan tried to reject an agreement resolving a financial disclosure case between the securities and exchange commission and citigroup because it did not contain an admission by the bank of any violations. the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in manhattan rejected that effort  finding that judges could not interfere with a federal agencys decision about the terms of a settlement. the deferred prosecution agreement with hsbc required only that mr. cherkasky provide information to the justice department  not that the reports be filed with the court or be made public. judge gleeson claimed that he had an obligation to oversee the case because it remained pending in his court  and therefore he could order the disclosure of documents despite the opposition of both sides to the agreement. if judge gleesons order is upheld on appeal  corporations may be reluctant to accept an outside monitor if there is a risk that the reports will be exposed to the public. the justice department prefers to use these agreements to resolve investigations  but monitors are not used in every case. the decision in the hsbc case may well lead prosecutors to avoid requiring a monitor if there is a risk that the reports will be subject to public disclosure that might endanger a settlement. advertisement another way to avoid the problem altogether would be to settle the investigation through a nonprosecution agreement in which the government does not file charges with the court but only states what it would have done had the case not been resolved. this keeps the resolution out of court completely because there is no judicial approval required  so a judge will not be able to interfere in the process even if a monitor is appointed. arguing in favor of maintaining the secrecy of monitor reports puts the justice department in the position of defending companies that engaged in misconduct and want to keep their compliance efforts out of the public eye. in other words  corporations need secrecy surrounding their compliance to keep from violating the law in the future. one of the reasons for the settlement is deterrence of future misconduct  but apparently that will be harmed if it were opened to wider scrutiny. the publics right to know can be inconvenient. whether the need for accountability that ms. lynch stressed in the settlement with hsbc also shields its report on compliance with the law will be an interesting test of how far the justice department will go to keep information from the public. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
business,advertisement by chad braynov. 21  2016  london  three of americas biggest banks potentially pose a greater risk to the global financial system than they did last year if they were to fail  global regulators said on monday. citigroup  bank of america and wells fargo  as well as the industrial and commercial bank of china  all moved up in the latest ranking of so-called global systemically important banks by the financial stability board  a switzerland-based group of central bankers and financial regulators from the worlds largest economies. under the financial stability boards methodology  the change would normally subject the banks to additional capital requirements. however  the american banks are already subject to high capital requirements set out by the federal reserve. the g.s.i.b. measure announced this morning by the f.s.b. does not have an impact on any of citis binding regulatory metrics  a citigroup spokeswoman said on monday. advertisement the latest ranking came as citigroup announced on monday that it would increase its common stock repurchase program by up to $1.75 billion  according to a regulatory filing. advertisement on monday  the financial stability board also deemed three banks less risky to global financial stability than they were last year: barclays  hsbc and morgan stanley. all three have sold part of their riskier businesses or reduced the size of some of them in the past year. worldwide  30 lenders are considered global systemically important banks and are subject to additional capital requirements. they are separated into five potential risk categories  the highest of which would have to hold an additional 3.5 percent of capital on top of minimum regulatory requirements. no banks were put in that highest risk category this year  which is intended to discourage banks from becoming more systemically important.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the changes in the allocation across buckets of the institutions on the list reflect the combined effects of data quality improvements  changes in underlying activity and the use of supervisory judgment  the financial stability board said in a news release. the dollars strengthening against the british pound and other currencies also played a role in the latest shift in the rankings for american lenders. though they are not all in the same group  citigroup  bank of america  wells fargo and i.c.b.c. each jumped up one place from the categories they were assigned last year. under the financial stability boards rules  citigroup joined jpmorgan chase this year in the second-highest group  facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of minimum regulatory standards. citigroup said it already faced a 3 percent surcharge under fed rules. bank of america is in the third group  facing a 2 percent surcharge under the boards rules. wells fargo and i.c.b.c. are in the fourth group  with an additional 1.5 percent requirement under the boards rules. higher capital buffer requirements set out by the financial stability board began to be phased in this year and are expected to be fully in place by the beginning of 2019. the capital requirements disclosed monday are to come into effect in 2018. follow chad bray on twitter @chadbray. a version of this article appears in print on november 22  2016  on page b3 of the new york edition with the headline: global regulator says 3 u.s. banks pose greater risk.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
business,advertisement by chad brayfeb. 11  2016  london  hsbc has changed course on its decision to freeze pay this year. pay increases will go forward in 2016  but a hiring freeze will remain in place  the banks chief executive  stuart t. gulliver  said in a memo to employees on thursday. hsbc unveiled plans to freeze hiring and pay in january  but it decided to reinstate pay increases after receiving feedback from employees  the memo said. the pay increases will come from the companys bonus pool  which will pay in 2017 bonuses for performance in 2016  the memo said. bonus payments this year  for work in 2015  are not affected. hsbc  which is based in london but generates more than half of its earnings in asia  has begun significant cost-cutting efforts  like many of its european banking rivals. the lender wants to cut its costs by $5 billion annually by the end of 2017. advertisement the bank said in june that it planned to shed up to 50 000 jobs  to sell several underperforming businesses and to shrink its global investment banking business. as flagged in our investor update  we have targeted significant cost reductions by the end of 2017  an hsbc spokeswoman said on thursday  confirming the contents of the memo. advertisement the lender is scheduled to report its full-year results this month  and it is expected to update investors on its cuts. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
business,advertisement by chad brayfeb. 22  2016  london  hsbc said on monday that it lost money in the fourth quarter and warned that it was being investigated for hiring candidates with ties to government officials in the asia-pacific region. the lender  which is based in britain but generates more than half its earnings in asia  also forecast that slowing economic growth in china would contribute to a bumpier financial environment. for the three months that ended dec. 31  hsbc  britains largest by assets  posted a loss of $1.33 billion  compared with a profit of $511 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. before taxes  hsbc posted a loss of $858 million in the final quarter of last year. in addition to reporting its earnings  hsbc said that it and multiple financial institutions were facing an investigation by the securities and exchange commission. the regulator  hsbc said  was looking into the hiring of candidates who were referred by  or related to  government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in asia. advertisement hsbc has received various requests for information and is cooperating with the s.e.c.s investigation  the lender said. advertisement in 2013  the commission opened an investigation into whether jpmorgan chase had hired the children of powerful chinese officials to help the bank get lucrative deals. that inquiry has since expanded to include the hiring practices of other banks in asia. for all of last year  hsbc reported a pretax profit of $18.9 billion  compared with $18.7 billion in 2014. but the lenders quarterly results were weighed down by restructuring costs and provisions for legal and regulatory matters  including a $370 million charge for potential settlements and $337 million to compensate customers who were improperly sold products in britain. the quarter also included loan-impairment charges and provisions for credit risk of $1.64 billion and a reduction in the fair market value of its debt. in asia  the banks pretax profit of $2.82 billion in the fourth quarter was lower than some analysts had expected.                  investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks bottom lines.             in a research note  the citigroup analysts ronit ghose and andrew coombs said they had expected a pretax profit of $3.5 billion from hsbcs asian business in the fourth quarter  but the bank had lower revenue than citigroup had forecast and slightly higher provisions on loan losses. douglas flint  the hsbc chairman  said in a news release that chinas slower economic growth will undoubtedly contribute to a bumpier financial environment  but it is still expected to be the largest contributor to global growth as its economy transitions to higher added value manufacturing and services and becomes more consumer driven. shares of hsbc declined as much as 5 percent in early trading in london on monday and were still down 3.75 percent in midafternoon trading. they fell about 2 percent in hong kong. advertisement the loss in the fourth quarter came as hsbc was reshaping its operations  including plans announced in june to shed tens of thousands of jobs  to sell several underperforming businesses and to shrink its global investment banking business. the bank said on monday that it had decided to retain and restructure its business in turkey  which would have accounted for some of the job cuts. hsbc said that it had received several offers since putting the business up for sale in june  but that none were deemed to be in the best interests of shareholders. last week  hsbc  which was founded in 1865 as the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation in hong kong  said it would keep its headquarters in britain after a lengthy review. in announcing its decision  hsbc said that asia remained at the heart of the groups strategy. the lender announced the formal review in april  citing increasing regulatory requirements and a tax that had hit banks based in britain particularly hard. the political environment  however  shifted after the conservative party gained full power in may 2014  after five years of a coalition government. since then  the british government has softened its tone on the banking industry  hoping to keep london an attractive home for such businesses. on a conference call with reporters  the banks chief executive  stuart gulliver  said it was unlikely that hsbc would again review whether to move its headquarters from london if britain were to decide in a june referendum to leave the european union. hsbc employs about 46 000 people in britain  but a british exit would not affect the bulk of those jobs  mr. gulliver said. our columnist andrew ross sorkin and

dollar on monday  despite prime minister david cameron having reached a deal with european leaders last week that he says gives the country a special status in the bloc. hsbc also said on monday that it had cut mr. gullivers salary  reflecting the banks weaker financial performance. advertisement mr. gullivers total compensation declined about 4 percent in 2015 to 7.34 million pounds  or about $10.6 million  the bank said. that is down from 7.62 million in 2014. revenue at hsbc fell 22 percent to $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter  from $13 billion in the period a year earlier. net interest income  the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities  declined 5 percent to $8.06 billion in the period  from $8.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. pretax profit in hsbcs investment bank  known as global banking and markets  rose to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter  from a loss of $85 million in the period a year earlier. pretax profit at its commercial banking business and its retail and wealth management unit both fell  however. the bank also said that an independent monitor  appointed as part of a deferred prosecution agreement reached in 2012 with the united states government  had expressed significant concerns about hsbcs efforts to put in place a financial-crime compliance program. those remarks came after the justice department said last year  in a summary of the monitors findings  that the pace of the lenders progress was too slow. in 2012  hsbc agreed to a $1.9 billion settlement after it was accused of laundering money for drug cartels and transferring funds for iran and other nations under united states sanctions. mr. flint said that the bank was confident its program was designed well  but he added that the monitor had specific  very detailed technical issues that needed to be addressed. its kind of a work in progress  he said. a version of this article

business,advertisement supported by editorial by the editorial board the editorial board represents the opinions of the board  its editor and the publisher. it is separate from the newsroom and the op-ed section. the special counsel  robert mueller  has not yet presented evidence that the trump campaign conspired with russian agents to subvert the 2016 election. but he has already provided an instructive guide to the swampy world of corporations  law firms and washington lobbying shops  and to how a tough prosecutor can bring some measure of justice to bear. the bank- and tax-fraud indictment of president trumps former campaign chairman paul manafort  for instance  lifted a rock on manipulation thats usually hidden. alex van der zwaan  a former lawyer with skadden  arps  slate  meagher & flom  was sentenced to 30 days in jail for lying to mr. muellers investigators about his conversations with mr. manaforts associate rick gates about a ukrainian businessman believed to be a russian intelligence operative. wait  you say  skadden arps? one of the top law firms in the country? how did they get caught up in this? it turns out that the firm was among the beneficiaries of $4 million in largess that mr. manafort and mr. gates distributed several years ago in their efforts as lobbyists to promote the moscow-backed regime that then controlled ukraine. no less a luminary than the skadden arps partner gregory craig  who had been white house counsel for president barack obama  oversaw a report the firm commissioned that called the governments prosecution of a dissident flawed but appropriate. [receive the days most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the opinion today newsletter.] the obama state department called that report flawed and inappropriate. skadden arps lawyers were obviously not going to find political motivation if they werent looking for it  a department spokeswoman said. last year the firm returned $567 000 to a new ukrainian government  now unencumbered by moscow ties. the indictment also revealed that mr. manafort enlisted the help of the democratic superlobbyist tony podesta and his firm  the podesta group  to promote the corrupt former ukrainian regime  even though mr. podesta did not register under the foreign agents registration act. the ensuing publicity helped destroy mr. podestas firm. one washington lawyer told the times  that this scrutiny raised concerns about the registration law and a new emphasis on enforcement that perhaps folks didnt think was happening or would happen. theres a novel thought: enforcing laws on white collar crime. take the extensive money laundering mr. manafort is accused of undertaking with shell companies that hide ownership. how could he have expected to get away with it? perhaps he saw what happened when one of the worlds largest banks  hsbc  helped launder billions of dollars in drug proceeds for the sinaloa cartel  for a financier for al qaeda and for others over nearly a decade. when they were caught  they only had to forfeit less than five weeks of profit. no bank employee was criminally charged. now consider the potential big fish in the special counsels investigation. three years ago  about three months before mr. trump announced his candidacy for president  the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network fined the trump taj mahal casino in atlantic city $10 million for willful and repeated violations of the bank secrecy act for failing to report suspicious transactions and failing to properly file currency transaction reports and keep proper records. the officials noted that the casino had a long history of prior  repeated b.s.a. violations cited by examiners dating back to 2003. the casino had been fined $477 700 in 1998. in other words  mr. trumps casino helped launder money and no one was charged with a crime. one-fifth of the condos owned by mr. trump in the united states were sold to shell companies like those mr. manafort used  buzzfeed news found. since mr. trump won the republican nomination  70 percent of domestic real estate sales by his companies were to shell companies  usa today has reported. a times investigation found that this sort of behavior is business as usual for many big developers  as shell companies with untraceable funds  not all with nefarious purposes  buy a disproportionate number of high-end condos in cities like new york. nor is this simply a problem for global urban centers. a shell company obscured the purchase of a lobbyists luxurious home by the beleaguered administrator of the environmental protection agency  scott pruitt  when he was an oklahoma state senator in 2003. the recent attention to mr. trumps personal attorney michael cohen illuminated another not uncommon practice of the business world. one of mr. cohens specialties was keeping people quiet. he made hush money payments to the women in mr. trumps life  including arranging for the national enquirer to make catch and kill payments for the rights to salacious stories that were then never published. the associated press reported that after it found out that the enquirer paid $30 000 to a doorman who said that mr. trump had fathered a child with one of his housekeepers  the papers parent company threatened the a.p. with legal action. were those lawyers associates of the louche mr. cohen? nope  they were from the firm of the legal paragon david boies  who defended same-sex marriage before the supreme court and fought for al gore in the florida recount debacle in 2000. mr. boies also worked to try to kill a new york times report on women who accused harvey weinstein of sexual assault and  as counsel to the fraudulent blood-testing company theranos  threatened to sue the wall street journal to prevent a report that showed the company was a complete con. a good guy in a bad cause  business as usual. (mr. boies firm did work for the times company until the new yorker reported that the firm had arranged what times officials called a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters on the weinstein story.) amid all the tawdry allegations in the cohen affair  the president would have us believe he is holding high the banner of a sacred principle  attorney-client privilege. the united states attorneys office in manhattan was able to overcome the privilege and seize documents from mr. cohen after persuading a judge that they probably contained evidence of criminal activity. in the world of white-collar crime  though  business as usual has meant that the attorney-client privilege has often been a means to keep the law at bay. companies have long used the privilege to shield information about misconduct. for some years in the bush administration federal prosecutors cut deals in which companies waived the privilege. after a lobbying campaign by businesses and an adverse court ruling  though  the justice department barred the practice. all this is an indictment of a criminal justice system that has fed the swamp in which mr. trump and his ilk thrive. industrial-level fraud by americas banks nearly brought the world economy to its knees in 2008  and no senior executive was even charged. this past week  with a billion dollars in new federal penalties for wells fargo  we were reminded that nobody has been hauled into court over a range of its sleazy practices one would expect from a boiler-room scam  not the nations third-largest bank. in his book the chickenshit club  named for how james comey  then a united states attorney  referred to prosecutors who never lost a case because they avoided ones they might not win  jesse eisinger documents how the department of justice has lost the will and indeed the ability to go after the highest-ranking corporate wrongdoers. mr. mueller is showing prosecutors a better way to deal with white-collar crime. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
business,advertisement by emily flitterfeb. 1  2018  three big banks were punished for market manipulation this week  and tucked into the punishment was a single sentence that could pay big dividends for the banking industry. under the 2010 dodd-frank financial regulation law  banks that violate financial rules are disqualified from access to a streamlined process for certain types of business they conduct  unless they receive a waiver from federal regulators. that provision  known as the bad actor rule  was created to make legal settlements with regulators riskier and more financially painful for banks  an incentive for them to avoid the conduct that precipitates such settlements. on monday  the commodity futures trading commission reached settlements with deutsche bank  hsbc and ubs group for a type of market manipulation called spoofing. the banks collectively paid just under $47 million to settle the civil charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. advertisement but while the commission and justice department trumpeted their crackdown on market manipulation  the settlements included language that gave all three banks an automatic waiver from the bad actor rule  drawing sharp criticism from one securities and exchange commissioner  a democrat. advertisement i am extremely disappointed by the c.f.t.c.s actions in this case  the commissioner  kara stein  said on thursday. they did not consult with the s.e.c. before injecting themselves into securities markets in which they have little or no expertise. the implications of the c.f.t.c.s actions are deeply troubling and may put u.s. investors at risk. erica elliott richardson  a spokeswoman for the c.f.t.c.  said granting the waivers lets the agency reach settlements with the banks more quickly. otherwise  she said  the banks would have wanted to apply for waivers from the bad actor rule before finalizing and announcing the settlement agreements. industry observers said the automatic waiver is one of the latest efforts by the trump administration to soften regulation of wall street  which republicans and some democrats believe has gone too far. j.w. verret  a professor at george mason universitys law school  said the c.f.t.c.s move relieved banks of a burden they never should have faced in the first place. outside of the partisan back and forth and outside of the cheap rhetoric about this issue  the reality is its very difficult to apply criminal and civil liability concepts for individuals to large multinational institutions  he said. thats what underlies this whole

regulatory matters. representatives of hsbc  deutsche bank and ubs declined to comment. the securities and exchange commission oversees the sale of securities like stocks and bonds. a longstanding

by regulators for knowingly engaging in misconduct stand to lose the privilege of bypassing the paperwork. the extra work can cost millions of dollars and delay new securities offerings for months or even years  stymying their clients attempts to raise money by issuing stocks or bonds. advertisement they can avoid that fate by applying for a waiver from the securities and exchange commission. regulators generally agree that the s.e.c. should grant such waivers liberally  because the alternative  handcuffing the worlds biggest banks  could have a detrimental impact on their large corporate clients  which employ hundreds of thousands of people and generate crucial economic activity. the waivers used to be granted automatically. but in mid-2015  the commodities trading commission ended the practice. the decision followed public criticism from ms. stein and senator elizabeth warren  a massachusets democrat and leading advocate for tougher regulation of wall street  who said the automatic waivers were an unwarranted sop to badly behaving banks. that change wasnt catastrophic for the banks. it simply meant they had to apply to the securities and exchange commission for the waivers  which were always granted. in december 2016  for example  goldman sachs group agreed to pay $120 million to settle a c.f.t.c. case over manipulation of a derivatives benchmark. the agency did not grant an automatic bad actor waiver as part of the settlement. instead  goldman had to go to the s.e.c. the banks lawyers told the commission that it would be extremely harmful to the bank if its market privileges were revoked. the s.e.c. granted goldmans request for a waiver. ms. elliott richardson said forcing banks to wait for waivers had kept the c.f.t.c. from finalizing settlement agreements. the s.e.c.s waiver process has taken up to nine months  she said. in these cases  this has delayed c.f.t.c. enforcement actions  which otherwise would have been resolved  for almost a year. a securities and exchange commission spokeswoman declined to comment. on thursday  when she learned of the c.f.t.c.s decision  ms. warren said: it amazes me that there are still republican officials who believe the lesson of the past decade is that federal regulators have been too hard on financial firms that break the law. kathryn judge  a columbia law school professor  said the change was a sign of the waning influence of ms. warren. elizabeth warren has done an outstanding job for a long period of time being simply so vocal and so visible and understandable to the public that the administration and regulators were scared to take action that would have invoked her ire  ms. judge said. regulators in the trump administration  however  simply feel less threatened by elizabeth warren as a figure  she said. because of an editing error  an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated which regulator reached settlements with three banks. it was the

business,advertisement by clifford kraussfeb. 25  2018  saudi arabia has long been the dominant force in oil  leaving the world at the mercy of its ambitions and its interests. now the kingdom must refresh its strategy to reflect a weaker hand  and in many ways  a different game. the changing nature of the energy industry  the oil production boom in american shale fields  the persistence of lower crude prices  and the rise of natural gas  has transformed the geopolitical equation. while saudi arabia is still a major energy producer  it must compensate for its lost revenue. and the united states  china and russia are all circling in hopes of gaining a financial advantage. russia  smarting from western sanctions and lower oil prices  is moving to embrace saudi arabia for energy deals despite their rivalry in syria  where the two countries support competing sides. china  with its domestic oil production in steep decline  seeks a stable flow not just of saudi oil but of saudi investment in its growing petrochemical and refinery industries. advertisement and washington is willing to overlook those flirtations in the hope that saudi arabia will continue to be a strategic bulwark against iran. advertisement the desires of all three superpowers fit neatly into saudi arabias strategy to find new investment partners as part of a broader push to diversify its oil-dependent economy  trim large budget deficits and secure the future of both the kingdoms welfare state and its monarchy. the keystone to the project is the proposed initial public stock offering of saudi aramco  the national oil company  a deal that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. the changing geopolitical game was on full display in december when saudi arabias energy minister  khalid al-falih  braved the russian arctic cold as president vladimir v. putins guest of honor at the opening of a giant natural-gas export terminal. for mr. putin  it was an audacious embrace of an american ally as he moved to expand his nations energy riches despite the current sanctions. for mr. al-falih  it was a chance to discuss future gas sales  attract investment in saudi aramco and coordinate efforts to prop up global oil prices. if we continue to work the way we do  we will turn from rivals to partners  mr. putin told mr. al-falih at the public ceremony. the saudi official readily agreed. the ultimate success of the saudi aramco public offering and the entirety of the kingdoms economic reform remain in question  and progress so far has been mixed. nevertheless  american  chinese and even russian financiers are entwined in a complex dance around the initial public offering  which is promised for later this year. president trump has publicly called for the i.p.o. to be listed in new york. a saudi listing now appears more likely  with additional trading in london or hong kong. global financiers say they want a piece of the action wherever it occurs. advertisement the interest in the i.p.o. has given the kingdom greater leverage at a time when the organization of the petroleum exporting countries  through which it has long wielded power  has lost much of its clout. the saudis are compensating for their lost power in opec and they are showing pure geopolitical pragmatism in their new energy and foreign policy  said bill richardson  a former energy secretary and ambassador to the united nations. but they are not just compensating for lost power. they are adding to their power in world politics. saudi arabia has had a central role in global energy since at least world war ii. when the kingdom created a global glut of oil to gain market share in the mid-1980s  it sent prices into a tailspin that contributed to the bankruptcy of the soviet union at the same time that it was financing afghan rebels fighting the soviets. the kingdom was such a crucial supplier of oil to the united states that washington went to war in the early 1990s in part to protect it from a possible iraqi invasion. and when china needed new energy supplies for its expanding economy in the early years of the new century  saudi arabia was there with an ambitious oil exploration program to meet the new demand. but opec can no longer control oil prices alone. a flood of oil from american shale fields has enabled the united states to slash imports of opec oil and begin exporting to markets that were once dominated by saudi crude.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the saudis  led by crown prince mohammed bin salman  are seeking to link cuts in opec production over the past two years with cuts by russia  another oil-exporting powerhouse  to buoy prices. over the longer term  the saudis want to import natural gas to replace domestic consumption of oil for electricity  freeing more crude for export. at the same time  the country is expanding its investments in refineries and petrochemical plants around asia and the united states to guarantee markets for its crude while making additional sales of higher-value gasoline  diesel and other refined products. low oil prices have made the saudi way of life unsustainable  so they have to find alternatives  said bruce riedel  a former middle east analyst for the central intelligence agency and the author of kings and presidents: saudi arabia and the united states since f.d.r. any partner they can find that can help them do that  they are going to embrace enthusiastically. the most surprising partner is russia  which remains on the opposite side of the syrian civil war and is also trying to build better relations with iran  saudi arabias bitter regional rival. advertisement in the fall of 2016  the crown princes father  king salman  made the first official trip to russia by a reigning saudi monarch. multiple cooperation agreements including military sales were reached  as well as a commitment by russias largest petrochemicals company  sibut  to build a plant in saudi arabia. kirill dmitriev  chief executive of the state-run russian direct investment fund  recently expressed interest in the saudi aramco public offering  even suggesting that a group of russian and chinese investors could join in a bid. relationships between the chinese and saudi oil companies had already grown close in recent years. aramco bought a 25 percent stake in a refinery in fujian province operated by the state-owned oil giant sinopec  and the companies have joint refinery ventures in saudi arabia. china and saudi arabia also signed a preliminary agreement last summer to create a $20 billion investment fund for infrastructure  energy and mining projects. we might as well work with them  said sadad ibrahim al-husseini  a former saudi aramco executive vice president. they desperately need energy  and we have a heck of a lot of energy  so the pieces fit. such deals also promote saudi aramcos efforts to become a global refining powerhouse. that can only increase the value of the proposed initial public offering of the company  which already produces more crude than any other in the world. many international banks  including jpmorgan chase  hsbc  goldman sachs  citigroup  morgan stanley and credit suisse  have been seeking to advise the kingdom and have a role in the eventual deal. every global investment bank should be interested in a lead role given the quality of the company and the fact that it would be the largest i.p.o. in history  said osmar abib  global head of oil and gas at credit suisse securities. the kingdom has valued the company at $2 trillion  a number that investment bankers say would be realistic only if oil were worth $100 a barrel  nearly $40 more than the current price. advertisement many energy experts doubt that the stock offering will be completed because of persistent questions about the rule of law in saudi arabia  as well as the special privileges granted to saudi royalty. they predict that members of the royal family will be reluctant to give up the confidentiality of their earnings from the company  which are now hidden from the public. at the same time  international investors have been shaken by the recent roundup of wealthy saudis who were forced to pay large sums of money for their freedom from confinement in a hotel. its going to be very hard for them to persuade anybody to buy a hunk of aramco until they figure out how to be more transparent about the royals take and the actual value of the company  said david l. goldwyn  who was the state departments top energy official early in the barack obama administration. saudi oil executives say the issues of valuation and governance will be worked out in the end because the crown prince and his father view the public offering as central to remaking the economy with more foreign investment. there is no backtracking  mr. al-husseini said. the i.p.o. commitment is driven by a central leadership  by people who are empowered to make decisions. its not a winding narrow road that comes to no conclusion. a

business,advertisement by alexandra stevensonjuly 20  2016  the global banking giant hsbc has repeatedly found itself in the cross hairs of american regulators and prosecutors in recent years. to settle allegations of money-laundering and mortgage abuses  it has paid billions of dollars  but has not been criminally charged. that has spurred an outcry that the bank is too big to jail. but now two senior executives of hsbc face criminal charges  accused of a currency manipulation scheme that federal prosecutors say generated $8 million in profits and fees. the global head of hsbcs foreign exchange cash trading desk  mark johnson  a briton  was arrested by federal agents tuesday night at kennedy international airport as he was boarding a flight to london. he and stuart scott  the former head of the banks currency trading desk for europe  the middle east and africa  were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to a transaction on behalf of a corporate client  exchanging dollars for british pounds. advertisement the charges are a boon to the justice department  which until now has not mounted any cases against individuals in its wide-ranging investigations into currency manipulation by the major banks. advertisement this case demonstrates the criminal divisions commitment to hold corporate executives  including at the worlds largest and most sophisticated institutions  responsible for their crimes  said leslie r. caldwell  the head of the justice departments criminal division. the case against the two men resembles a conventional insider trading scheme  but with a twist because the defendants traded in currencies instead of stocks. hsbc was hired to convert dollars into british pounds for a company as it was preparing to complete the sale of a subsidiary. the complaint does not identify the client  but it was cairn energy  according to a person with direct knowledge of the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity. cairn  a midsize oil and gas company based in edinburgh  was selling its indian subsidiary to vedanta resources  an indian conglomerate owned by the mining magnate anil agarwal. the two hsbc executives are accused of using their knowledge of the deal to trade ahead of the $3.5 billion currency transaction  ramping up the price of one currency to benefit the bank at the expense of its client. the criminal complaint unsealed on wednesday detailed conversations between mr. scott and mr. johnson discussing how high they could ramp up the price of the currency before the company would squeal. in the federal district court in brooklyn on wednesday  mr. johnson  50  was released on a $1 million bond secured by $300 000 cash and his house in britain. a lawyer for mr. johnson did not respond to a request for comment. it is unclear where mr. scott  who is 43 and also a british citizen  is currently located. the case is being led by federal prosecutors in the office of robert l. capers  the united state attorney in brooklyn. advertisement the criminal charges against the individuals follows a broader investigation of banks into alleged manipulation of foreign currency trading that federal prosecutors began about three years ago. hsbc was one of five banks to reach a combined $4.25 billion settlement in 2014 with united states  british and swiss regulators over accusations that the banks had conspired to manipulate currency rates. but hsbc was not among five banks that agreed last year to plead guilty to felony charges in connection with manipulating the price of dollars and euros. those banks agreed to pay criminal fines totaling more than $2.5 billion. hsbc has previously said the justice department is continuing to investigate the bank. it has set aside an additional $1.3 billion for further potential settlements  according to a filing last summer.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. robert sherman  a spokesman for hsbc  which is based in london  said on wednesday that the bank had been and would continue to cooperate with the justice departments foreign exchange investigation. while hsbc was not implicated in wednesdays criminal complaint  the case is another black eye for the london-based bank that has substantial operations in the united states. in 2012  it paid $1.9 billion in fines to united states authorities to settle allegations of being a conduit for illegal money. the deal included a deferred-prosecution agreement with the manhattan district attorneys office and the justice department. the justice departments decision not to criminally charge hsbc in that case received renewed scrutiny last week  when a report prepared by republican staff of the house financial services committee showed that prosecutors at the justice department wanted to criminally charge the bank  but were overruled by top officials in the department  including the attorney general at the time  eric h. holder jr. and hsbc paid $550 million in 2014 to settle allegations that it made billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities appear to be compliant with regulations. advertisement the latest case stems from 2011  when hsbc was one of 10 banks that were invited to bid for the right to execute the currency transaction on behalf of cairn energy. each competing bank was required to sign a confidentiality agreement. in its bid submission  hsbc pledged it could provide one quote for the full amount or even drip feed the market in the utmost confidential nature so as to ensure there are no sudden fx moves against the company  according to the complaint. but when hsbc won the bid in october of 2011  it did the exact opposite  the complaint says. after securing the lucrative job  a supervisor at hsbc told mr. scott on a call that the bank did not want to push the market too much higher and at the same time we want to make money on this  according to the complaint. mr. johnson and mr. scott began to buy british pounds in exchange for other currencies  which they later sold for a profit to hsbc on the day of cairns currency deal on dec. 7  the government said. in a call to discuss the details of cairns transaction with hsbc  mr. scott falsely and fraudulently advised representatives at cairn on the best time of the day to execute the trade  according to the complaint. when an adviser working on behalf of the company questioned mr. scotts logic  he added that if traders in the market were aware of the transaction  they will try to jump in front and start to muck around in the markets  according to the complaint. mr. johnson also gave his own personal recommendation along the same lines. minutes after the call ended  mr. scott and mr. johnson began aggressively buying up pounds. when cairn representatives did notice the sudden spike in the price of the british pound and asked hsbc  the person was told the spike in trading was the result of a russian bank buying pounds at the same time as cairn. mr. johnson  according to the complaint  was surprised to learn that cairn energy decided to go ahead with the multibillion-dollar currency transaction  even as his trading in the markets had caused the price of the currency to soar to its highest point of the day. responding to the news  mr. johnson replied  ohhhh  christmas  using an expletive as an adjective. leslie picker contributed reporting. a version of this article appears in print on july 21  2016  on page b1 of the new york

business,advertisement  white collar watch  by                      peter j. henning  july 25  2016  the global banking giant hsbc is back in the news in another tussle with united states prosecutors. this time it involves a charge of wire fraud conspiracy against two of its foreign exchange executives  who are accused of front-running a trade by the banks client to generate a $3 million profit. the question is whether taking advantage of a clients decision to engage in a transaction with some dishonest statements is enough to produce a fraudulent scheme. or was it just the usual sharp practice seen on wall street countless times before  which did not violate the law even though it might have been unethical? front-running is when a firm trades ahead of a customers large order that is likely to move the market  profiting off the inside knowledge of the impending change in the price. a criminal complaint filed in the federal district court in brooklyn accuses mark johnson  the global head of hsbcs foreign exchange cash trading desk  and stuart scott  the former head of the banks currency trading desk for europe  the middle east and africa  of conspiracy to defraud a company  subsequently identified as cairn energy  in a $3.5 billion currency exchange in december 2011. the company had just completed the sale of its indian subsidiary  and used hsbc to convert the proceeds from dollars into british pounds. advertisement amid broad investigations of the rigging of the currency rates by major banks  these are the first charges against individuals. hsbc itself is not accused of any wrongdoing in the case  but it did pay a $275 million penalty in 2014 in a civil settlement with the commodity futures trading commission for manipulation of benchmark rates used in the foreign exchange markets. advertisement the charge is that mr. johnson and mr. scott engaged in ramping the price of the british pound by trading in accounts they controlled for the bank in advance of the large currency conversion  costing its client money because the exchange rate was less favorable while hsbc reaped a nice profit off its trades. securities firms are prohibited from front-running client block orders by a rule issued by the financial industry regulatory authority  or finra. to prove fraud  however  prosecutors must show more than front-running because the trading is not necessarily deceptive  even though it breaks the rules for brokerage firms. and while it sounds like insider trading  the absence of a fiduciary duty means it falls outside that proscription. in united states v. finnerty  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in manhattan upheld the dismissal of charges against a stock specialist for violating rule 10b-5  the primary antifraud provision  for trading ahead of his firms customers. the appeal court found that the government has identified no way in which finnerty communicated anything to his customers  let alone anything false  to prove the deception necessary for a securities violation. hsbcs currency trading does not involve a security  so the case instead is based on the broad wire fraud statute. the law prohibits any scheme or artifice to defraud another person of money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses  representations or promises. as the finnerty decision makes clear  fraud requires some form of deception  and not just taking advantage of clients  even if it costs them money. cairn energy may have thought hsbc would put its interest first  but the bank was not obligated to so  although the trading certainly does not help build trust with future clients.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. establishing deception means finding a lie  so the complaint outlines in some detail how mr. johnson and mr. scott misled the company about the best way to execute the currency transaction and why the price of the pound seemed to be spiking around the planned time for the conversion. when asked about the increasing price of the british currency  the complaint says that a hsbc supervisor told the company that it was the result of buying by a russian name  failing to disclose that the bank was ramping the value of the pound. advertisement when cairn energy went ahead with the trade despite the rising price  mr. johnson expressed some surprise and told mr. scott in a telephone call  ohhhh  christmas!  also slipping an expletive in there  according to the complaint. shortly after the currency transaction  mr. scott told the company that the bank was taking action regarding the increased value of the pound  but never mentioning how its earlier trades affected the price. the details in the complaint paint a picture of mr. johnson and mr. scott dissembling to keep the customer from learning about how hsbc was taking an advantageous position ahead of the large trade to increase its profit from the $3.5 billion order. an interesting issue is whether any of the statements described in the complaint add up to a fraud  or were intended to ease the mind of a client that decided to go ahead with the currency conversion despite the uptick. there were no misstatements about the price of the pound  and cairn energy was paying close attention to the upward movement in the currency market. it could have pulled the plug on the deal at almost any time  but chose to go ahead. whether anything conveyed actually deceived the company  or was important to its decision to move forward  is something that is sure to be challenged by the defendants. hsbcs own review of the transaction found no violation of its code of conduct  according to the financial times  which is sure to be used by the defendants to argue that they did not commit a crime. federal appeals courts have been unwilling lately to find that sharp business practices involving sophisticated parties are fraudulent when they can be addressed more appropriately in a civil lawsuit for breach of contract. the decision of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in chicago in united states v. weimert earlier this year found that lies told by a bank officer to both side during negotiations for selling a property investment could not be the basis for a wire fraud conviction. the second circuit overturned a jury verdict that countrywide home loans committed mail and wire fraud in a mortgage program that resulted in loans being sold to fannie mae and freddie mac that fell well below the standards specified in their contracts. the appeals court found insufficient evidence of fraudulent intent at the time of the sales because the firm took advantage of the government enterprises but never actively misled them. the charges against mr. scott and mr. johnson depend on showing more than just questionable ethics in profiting off a client. instead  the government will have to prove an agreement to effectively steal from the customer through deception  because fraud is a type of larceny. questionable comments and dissembling about the reason for a rising market may be bad business  but whether they constitute a crime remains to be seen. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

business,advertisement by chad bray and james kanterdec. 7  2016  european antitrust regulators on wednesday fined crdit agricole  hsbc and jpmorgan chase a total of just over 485 million euros for colluding to fix benchmark interest rates tied to the euro. the penalties  equivalent to about $520 million  came more than two years after the european authorities issued a statement of objections  a formal step in antitrust investigations  against the three banks. the inquiry began in 2011. in december 2013  the european union fined a group of global financial institutions a combined 1.7 billion to settle charges that they had colluded to fix benchmark interest rates  including the euro interbank offered rate  or euribor. it was the largest combined penalty ever levied by european competition authorities. the three banks fined on wednesday did not settle in 2013. the potential fines against those that did settle were reduced 10 percent. advertisement asked how much money the collusion had made for the banks involved  margrethe vestager  the commissioner in charge of european competition policy  told a news conference in brussels that she could not give a precise figure. advertisement euribor and other benchmark interest rates help determine the costs of borrowing for trillions of dollars in loans  credit cards and mortgages. to set the euribor and other benchmarks  banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend to one another  on an unsecured basis  in various currencies and maturities. in its investigation  the european commission  the european unions executive arm  found that traders at seven banks  including crdit agricole  hsbc and jpmorgan chase  were involved in a cartel between september 2005 and may 2008 to improperly influence the pricing of euro interest rate derivatives. the commission found that the traders  using chat rooms and instant messaging services  had shared their desired or intended submissions for euribor and had exchanged information on their trading positions or on their trading or pricing strategies.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. ms. vestager noted what she said was vulgar language used by traders in the case. even though its christmas  i dont think i should complement my green dress with very red cheeks  and i think i would be seriously blushing if i were to repeat any of the wording in some of those chat rooms  she said. jpmorgan chase received the largest fine: 337.2 million. crdit agricole was penalized 114.7 million and hsbc 33.6 million. the banks have up to two years to appeal. any appeal would be heard by the european unions general court. we have cooperated fully with the european commission throughout its five-year investigation  jpmorgan chase said in a statement. we did not engage in any wrongdoing with respect to the euribor benchmark. we will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations  including through possible appeals to the european courts. crdit agricole also said that it would appeal the fine  adding that it "firmly believes that it did not infringe competition law. advertisement hsbc said it did not participate in an anti-competitive cartel and was reviewing the european commissions decision and considering our legal options. the european investigation is one of several around the world that have found evidence that traders at banks benefited from falsely reported rates. inquiries by american  british and other regulators into manipulation of euribor and the london interbank offered rate  known as libor  have ensnared a number of large global institutions. eleven people face criminal charges in britain related to the manipulation of euribor. follow chad bray @chadbray and james kanter @jameskanter on twitter. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

business,advertisement by norimitsu onishi and selam gebrekidanapril 16  2018  vrede  south africa  with loudspeakers blaring  city officials drove across the black townships dirt roads in a pickup truck  summoning residents to the town hall. the main guest was a local figure who had soared up the ranks of the governing african national congress and come back with an enticing offer. over the next few hours  the visiting political boss  mosebenzi joseph zwane  sold them on his latest deal: a government-backed dairy farm that they  as landless black farmers  would control. they would get an ownership stake in the business  just by signing up. they would go to india for training  all expenses paid. to hear him tell it  the dairy would bring jobs to the impoverished  help build a clinic and fix the roads. he said he wanted to change our lives  said ephraim dhlamini  who  despite suspicions that the offer was too good to be true  signed up to become a beneficiary of the project. this thing is coming from the government  free of charge. you cant say you dont like this thing. you must take it. but  sure enough  his instincts were right. the dairy farm turned out to be a classic south african fraud  prosecutors say: millions of dollars from state coffers  meant to uplift the poor  vanished in a web of bank accounts controlled by politically connected companies and individuals. advertisement the money from an array of state contracts like this one helped pay for a lavish wedding that a top executive at kpmg  the international accounting firm  described as an event of the millennium  according to leaked emails. and mr. zwane  continuing his meteoric rise  soon leaped to the national stage to become south africas minister of mineral resources. advertisement almost nothing trickled down to the township or the scores of would-be beneficiaries after that first meeting in 2012. the only local residents to get a free trip to india were members of a church choir headed by mr. zwane. in the generation since apartheid ended in 1994  tens of billions of dollars in public funds  intended to develop the economy and improve the lives of black south africans  have been siphoned off by leaders of the a.n.c.  the very organization that had promised them a new  equal and just nation. corruption has enriched a.n.c. leaders and their business allies  black and white south africans  as well as foreigners. but the supposed beneficiaries of many government projects  in whose names the money was spent  have been left with little but seething anger and deepening disillusionment with the state of post-apartheid south africa. while poverty has declined since the end of apartheid  inequality has risen in a society that was already one of the worlds most unequal  according to a recent report by the world bank and the south african government. south africa has a large  advanced economy  an aggressively free press and a wealth of independent organizations and scholars who keep a close watch on government malfeasance. but even with its vibrant democracy  in which the details of corruption schemes are routinely aired and condemned by the news media and opposition politicians  graft has engulfed the country. the nation was governed for nine years by the scandal-plagued president jacob zuma  whose close ties with the gupta family  three indian brothers at the helm of a sprawling business empire built on government contracts  including the dairy farm  outraged voters. their cozy relationship contributed to the a.n.c.s recent electoral losses and helped lead to mr. zumas ouster two months ago. promising a new dawn  mr. zumas replacement  cyril ramaphosa  has said that he would make fighting corruption a priority as the nations new president. but he is also a veteran a.n.c. insider  and the early signs have not been encouraging. advertisement having become party leader by a razor-thin margin  mr. ramaphosa has tried to keep together a fractured a.n.c. by moving cautiously. he formed his first cabinet by appointing some well-respected officials  but also included allies  his own and mr. zumas  who have been accused of corruption by the public protectors office and good governance groups. beyond that  politicians who long oversaw provinces rife with public corruption  including the one where the dairy farm is  now sit at the top of the a.n.c.s hierarchy. national prosecutors  often criticized for being servile to the sitting president  say they are trying to recover more than $4 billion lost to corruption related to the gupta familys undue influence on mr. zumas administration. and that is just a small measure of the corruption that has whittled away at virtually every institution in the country  including schools  public housing  the police  the power utility  south african airways and state enterprises overseeing everything from rail service to the defense industry. almost no one comes out of this looking good. at just under $21 million  the money lost in the vrede dairy farm may seem small. but it is a big test of whether south africas new government has the power and the will to confront public corruption at its source. the police have apprehended some low- and midlevel officials involved in the dairy farm  the first arrests related to a high-profile case of public corruption during the zuma presidency. but notably  they have yet to pursue any a.n.c. officials. mr. zwane has not faced any charges. whats more  the provincial premier who approved the project  ace magashule  was recently elected secretary general of the a.n.c.  elevating him to the top ranks of the partys leadership. the endless scandals have also raised serious questions about the complicity of major western companies  with multiple investigations scrutinizing the role they may have played in enabling corruption and weakening the countrys institutions. south african regulators have urged the police to begin a criminal inquiry into mckinsey  the american consulting giant  over its relationship with a gupta-linked company in a contract involving a state-owned utility. a south african court has frozen the $83 million mckinsey was paid for the contract  and the firm says it will return the fee. advertisement regulators say they have also pressed the police to investigate kpmg  the big four auditing firm based in the netherlands  for its work for the national revenue service in 2015. kpmg has acknowledged that elements of the work should no longer be relied upon and offered to pay back its consulting fees. sap  the german software behemoth  is being investigated by the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission after it disclosed payments to intermediaries on state contracts that may have contravened the foreign corrupt practices act. international banks have been ensnared in the scandals  too. hsbc and standard chartered have been accused by a british lawmaker of laundering the guptas ill-gotten gains. hsbc says it has closed a number of accounts that belonged to front companies operated by the gupta family. many trace the deep corruption in the nation to a fundamental flaw in south africas transition from white rule to democracy a generation ago. in the grand bargain struck between the apartheid government and the a.n.c.  headed by nelson mandela  a transfer of power was carried out peacefully  disproving predictions of civil war and earning mr. mandela accolades as a visionary peacemaker. but the deal was reached on what many south africans today consider pyrrhic terms: the black majority was allowed to control politics  but much of the countrys economic resources  including land  has remained in the hands of white south africans and a small group of other elites. in the early years of a.n.c. rule  mr. mandela and other top leaders  who had helped defeat apartheid but had no personal savings  received houses  vehicles and money from white business leaders  essentially bribes  critics say. a smattering of influential figures  like the current president  mr. ramaphosa  amassed extraordinary wealth. they were allowed to buy shares of white-owned companies on extremely generous terms and invited to sit on corporate boards. they acted as conduits between the governing party and the white-dominated business world. some of the a.n.c. leaders who were left out of that bonanza quickly found a new road to wealth: lucrative government contracts. the public tap became a legitimate source of wealth for the well connected  but also a wellspring of corruption and political patronage  much as it had been for the white minority during apartheid. advertisement over the years  mr. zuma and his allies  while never admitting corruption  often played down its corrosive effect on society and emphasized the need to redistribute wealth to black south africans. it is an argument that mr. zuma is expected to make in defending himself against recently reinstated charges of corruption in an arms deal from the late 1990s. while mr. mandela is still revered in the west  his legacy is regarded more critically in south africa  especially by some young black people. to them  he sold out the countrys black masses to the white business elite. even some of mr. mandelas longtime supporters struggle to defend the deal that he struck to bring democracy to south africa. ultimately  it left most black people in poverty while benefiting a small elite  including the chief negotiator during the talks  mr. ramaphosa. after 27 years as a political prisoner  mr. mandela did not understand south africas political economy and agreed to a settlement that failed to secure black south africans economic independence  said mamphela ramphele  an anti-apartheid activist who became close to mr. mandela. she later went on to serve as a managing director of the world bank. he didnt know any better  ms. ramphele said. the dairy farm case is emblematic of the many ills afflicting south africa a quarter-century after the end of apartheid. it shows how corruption  in a government controlled at all levels by a single party  has entrenched old racial inequalities. about 125 miles southeast of johannesburg  in the province of free state  vrede is a small farming town with discount chain stores  two supermarkets and a gas station. a cemetery and a police station  buffers during the apartheid era  still separate vrede from the neighboring black township of thembalihle. as in so many other townships  the level of local corruption can be quickly gauged by the quality of government housing for the poor. in one of the most common sources of corruption  money and building materials are diverted from a housing project  often leaving behind shoddy dwellings for poor residents who have waited years or decades to move out of shacks. in a new outpost of the township  single-family government houses were so poorly built that many have collapsed  while new houses are being erected on shaky foundations and frames  with deep cracks spreading across extremely thin walls. advertisement in many ways  the area is a microcosm of the enduring economic imbalance in south africa. nationally  black people make up 80 percent of the population  but most remain shut out of economic opportunities. white people  accounting for 8 percent  retain an oversize influence on the economy. nearly all of the commercial farmers around vrede are white  as is the main government contractor. in the adjoining township  black people operate small taverns and basic carwashes. but in the town of vrede itself  white people still own all of the faded buildings on the main street  where they  along with immigrants from other african nations and countries like pakistan and bangladesh  operate shops. black people  who were not allowed to live in the town under apartheid  now own or rent only about 10 percent of its residences. this system that was built for us  blacks  its very difficult for us to create our own businesses  said veli thulani tshabalala  29  who runs a computer and cellphone repair shop with his cousin. they are the only black south africans to operate a store in vrede. pieter bergh  83  a white south african who served on vredes city council in the years immediately before and after the end of apartheid  agreed that little has changed for black south africans since 1994 and that the economic inequality has remained static. they only received the power to vote  that was all  mr. bergh said  adding that he definitely considered that a historical mistake. in the late 1990s  officials were purged from city government and replaced by a.n.c. appointees with little experience. the purge  which occurred at all levels of government across the nation  contributed to the corruption that emerged toward the end of mr. mandelas term. here in free state  one of the first post-apartheid cases of corruption in government revolved around mr. magashule  the a.n.c.s current secretary general. mr. magashule  now 59  has served as the partys leader in free state since the very end of apartheid in 1994. he grew up in parys  a small town in the province. during apartheid  he was an underground a.n.c. operative whose boldness caught the attention of winnie mandela  nelsons wife and an anti-apartheid activist. advertisement after white rule ended  he oversaw economic development in the cabinet of the first post-apartheid provincial premier  mosiuoa lekota. in an interview  mr. lekota said he had caught mr. magashule stealing government funds  a charge that mr. magashule  whose spokespeople did not respond to interview requests for this article  has long denied. mr. lekota said he had fired mr. magashule  but was overruled by his patron  the a.n.c.s deputy secretary general at the time: mr. zuma. in the early days after the end of apartheid  mr. zuma openly complained about the a.n.c. leaders who were getting rich. most  like mr. ramaphosa and tokyo sexwale  another anti-apartheid activist  were favorites of mr. mandela. zuma did go to some of the other guys and said to them  this is what mandela is doing. we must wake up and we must go for the money ourselves   said mr. lekota  who left the a.n.c. to found his own party  the congress of the people  in 2008. mr. magashule went on to flourish inside free state. he became premier of the province in 2009 just as mr. zuma became president. like other powerful premiers  he was able to turn his province into a fief  said mr. lekota and several provincial officials from the a.n.c.  as well as its historical ally  the south african communist party. taxes are mostly collected by the national government  and the money is redistributed to the provinces  where it is spent with little oversight. free state  a rural economy where black people remain dependent on the a.n.c. for jobs and government contracts  has remained a stronghold for the party even as it has lost support among middle-class black voters in urban areas. mr. magashules ambitions  however  were never confined to the province. like mr. zuma  he forged a relationship with the gupta brothers  who had befriended some high-ranking a.n.c. figures after arriving in south africa from their native india in the early 1990s. mr. magashules son  tshepiso  worked for the guptas  and  according to emails leaked from a gupta-company server  served as a conduit to his fathers office. advertisement under mr. magashules governance  many of the provinces public services departments teetered on the brink of insolvency  according to a.n.c. officials and opposition parties. in a harsh report in 2017  the national auditor said that free states government showed a lack of accountability and commitment towards clean administration  adding that the situation had worsened in recent years. if you find that the one who is supposed to be the custodian of the purse like the premier  he is the one who is involved in corrupt practices  it becomes easy then for others also to get involved  said thabo manyoni  an a.n.c. official in free state who was once a close friend and deputy of mr. magashule. you end up in a situation where nobody is able to stop anyone else because we all are doing it  mr. manyoni said. to many  the dairy farm project appeared to be a swindle from the beginning. for starters  there were ample suspicions about the pitchman  mr. zwane. i know this guy  said mr. dhlamini  the would-be beneficiary who was also the chairman of vredes arm of the african farmers association  a national organization for black farmers. i dont trust him.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. as he climbed the political ranks  mr. zwane often came back to thembalihle  the black township next to vrede. sometimes  he doled out fistfuls of cash from the trunk of his latest luxury car  said a.n.c. and opposition politicians  as well as many residents. throughout the township and town  many people shared the same wariness of mr. zwane. his meteoric rise had been too fast and seemed tied to the corruption taking hold in the a.n.c. and in free state. mr. zwane  who declined through a spokesman to comment for this article  grew up on a nearby farm and moved to thembalihle in his teens. people remember him as an undistinguished student who  after high school  taught the children of black farm laborers in a nearby village where he met his future wife. the couple lived next to the school building  in a low  two-room concrete structure that is still used as a schoolteachers residence. there  villagers remember mr. zwane as an engaged teacher  at least until he became a district councilor and his interests turned to politics. soon  mr. zwane rose swiftly in the party  as well as in local and district governments  thanks in great part to his close relationship with the provinces head of the a.n.c.  mr. magashule  according to politicians in free state. he joined mr. magashules cabinet in 2009 and a few years later took over the agriculture portfolio. advertisement when mr. zwane became the provincial minister of agriculture  many black farmers in vrede rejoiced. like others in the country  they had neither capital nor land. with a local son heading the provinces department of agriculture  they thought their lives were going to change  recalled meshack ncongwane  the deputy chairman of vredes african farmers association. a dozen black farmers from vrede chartered a bus  each paying about $20  to attend mr. zwanes swearing-in ceremony in the provincial capital  bloemfontein  about four hours away. even the associations chairman  the skeptical mr. dhlamini  went along. we were happy  mr. ncongwane said  adding  in hindsight  although we were happy for a crook. in 2012  mr. zwane and agricultural department officials arrived in vrede to promote the dairy farm project. flanked by the council speaker  roseline zwane  known as topsy  who happened to be his wife  and by his longtime ally  mayor tlokotsi john motaung  mr. zwane told the crowd about a dairy farm that would empower black farmers and create 150 jobs. shortly afterward  his department signed the first of its two dairy farm agreements with a company called estina. this was a peculiar choice. estina was to buy cows for local farmers and process milk at the farm. but the company was headed by a businessman from india who had a background in information technology  not in farming. yet  importantly  he had long worked for the guptas. despite the projects sketchy details  mr. zwane signed off on it and asked the provincial treasury to start paying estina  according to an investigation by the national treasury. initially  he was overruled by lawyers in mr. magashules office  who deemed the contract invalid because procurement rules  like a competitive bid  had not been followed. but that was only a hiccup. the province signed another contract with estina the following month  this time with the lawyers blessing. that agreement stated that estina would invest just under $20 million in the project and the province would contribute about $30 million over three years. local farmers  the so-called beneficiaries  would retain 51 percent of the shares. advertisement there was something fishy from the start  said doctor radebe  who was a councilor for the opposition democratic alliance in vrede. mr. zwane and the agricultural officials presented no business plan or budget for the project  but they and the mayor insisted on pressing ahead  mr. radebe said. the local municipality quickly decided to hand over 3 400 hectares  or about 8 400 acres  of land for the dairy farm. in fact  the municipality was so determined to get the project underway that it compensated four white commercial farmers  who had been leasing the land for about $80 000 a year  in order to prematurely break their leases. later that year  just before mr. zwane and his local choir left for india  on a trip sponsored by a gupta company  the province leased the farm to estina  rent-free  for 99 years. in an interview  mayor motaung said  we had no doubt that the plan will work. but the mayor acknowledged that mr. zwane presented no detailed plan or document about the proposed dairy farm. even basic details  like the criteria for selecting the beneficiaries  were missing  the mayor said  acknowledging that his role in the project was now under scrutiny. the payments to estina began months later. court documents show that the province deposited just under $21 million in two estina bank accounts over three years. days after every payment  the company transferred the entire sum to other accounts. from there  prosecutors say  the money was withdrawn by individuals and other gupta-linked companies that had little to do with the farm. in fact  prosecutors say that only about 1 percent of the money invested by the province actually went into dairy farming. beyond that  the national treasury found no evidence that estina ever invested its own money in the project  despite its obligation to do so. emails leaked from a gupta company server indicate that some of the money was sent to the united arab emirates and put into accounts registered to the guptas. the money then made its way back to south africa through a maze of bank transfers  according to spreadsheets  logs and an invoice in the email trove. the emails  amounting to thousands of exchanges  were leaked last year to south african news organizations and an anti-corruption group. it is not known who leaked them  though they soon fanned national outrage at the gupta family and at mr. zuma. the guptas denied the authenticity of the emails  but some a.n.c. officials included in the correspondence confirmed that they were real. advertisement in one of the emails  gupta companies paid one another for expenses at a relatives lavish four-day wedding in 2013  including fireworks  dancers  chocolates and scarves. in another exchange  kpmg  then an auditor of the gupta companies  ignored a junior employees protest and allowed the gupta family to write off some of the expenses at the wedding as business costs. i have never been to an event like that  moses kgosana  a kpmg executive who attended the wedding  gushed to a gupta brother in one of the emails  calling it an event of the millennium. the accounting firm has since acknowledged that its actions fell well short of the quality expected. many of the problems surrounding the dairy farm could have been ignored had the province not tried to tap into a national fund for struggling farmers. the national government initially agreed to give about $4 million to the project on the condition that the province submit  among other things  a list of 100 poor farmers who would benefit from the farm. when the government found no evidence that local farmers were involved  it sent national treasury auditors to investigate in 2013. though mr. zwane  sometimes accompanied by his wife  had held meetings to look for beneficiaries  no official list had been drawn. after the auditors started asking questions  a list of beneficiaries  between 80 and 100  depending on the version  was hastily assembled. some were genuine farmers. others  they are not even farmers  mr. radebe said  adding that many were a.n.c. supporters. they dont even have a cat. advertisement estina did try its hand at dairy farming in vrede. when the national treasurys investigators visited in 2013  they found about 350 cows and some buildings under construction. but the seemingly inflated costs  including $215 000 for a manually sliding gate and a guardhouse  drew scrutiny from the opposition party. and while the beneficiaries were supposedly the farms owners  they were never informed of the projects developments. they were not even allowed to visit the premises. those who were serious about farming started to complain. at a meeting with officials in the provincial government  mr. dhlamini and mr. ncongwane  of the african farmers association  said that when they raised questions about the project  they were dismissed as noisy frogs. that especially stung mr. dhlamini  who once was the only black south african business owner in vrede. he ran a small record store called siyathuthuka  or were moving forward  in the zulu language  but was forced to shutter his store because of rising rents. he was now focused full time on farming and owned 35 cows. in early 2014  the national treasury sent a scathing report to mr. magashule  the premier of free state  and told the province to stop paying estina. but it took free state another six months to take the farm back. the province even continued to pay estina another $11 million after officially terminating the contract  court documents show. in the end  a project meant to empower black farmers like mr. dhlamini further enriched the guptas and one of the wealthiest white men in vrede  willie basson. with a fleet of vehicles  construction equipment and billboards advertising his business all over town  mr. basson is the main government contractor in vrede and helped build the dairy farm. but he said that estina mismanaged the business so badly that he ended up having to dig graves for as many as 100 cows  even though he had delivered feed for them. they just do projects like this to get money  he said in an interview in his office. thats how they operate  but  luckily  they paid me every cent  mr. basson said. advertisement hey! its rotten in this place here  he exclaimed  pounding on the table in front of him. and we work with all of them  so we know. it was a measure of how corrupt south africa had become a generation after the end of apartheid that nothing was done about the vrede dairy farm case for years. the national police and prosecutors looked away even after the national treasury raised alarms about the project. in free state  some who spoke out against public corruption were suddenly killed in circumstances that  even in a country with widespread violent crime  aroused suspicions. moses tshake  a provincial government auditor who inquired about projects in the agriculture department  was killed in a carjacking in 2013. in warden  a town where mr. zwane has a large home  vusi mlaba  a politician who had campaigned against corruption in public housing  was fatally shot a dozen times just outside his home in 2016. police investigations resulted in no arrests in either case. as for mr. zwane  the dairy farm hardly hurt his career. during mr. zumas presidency  the gupta brothers increasingly acquired economic and political influence by forging close ties with the president  his son and political allies like mr. magashule  the provincial premier who endorsed the dairy farm project. a lawyer for atul gupta  from whom prosecutors tried to recover public money spent on the dairy farm  did not respond to a request for an interview with his client. the guptas influence  and possibly direct role  in the appointment of ministers and other important government officials has been investigated by the public protector and is expected to be a focus of a recently begun government inquiry into public corruption. in august 2015  according to the leaked emails  tony gupta  the youngest of the three brothers  forwarded mr. zwanes rsum to duduzane zuma  one of the presidents sons  who was a director of many companies operated by the guptas. two months later  mr. zwane  whose highest qualification is a teachers diploma  became south africas new minister of mineral resources  one of the most important  and potentially lucrative  portfolios. advertisement shortly after his appointment  mr. zwane went to zurich with tony gupta and met with an executive from glencore  the giant international commodities and mining firm. at the time  the guptas were trying to buy a glencore coal mine. in a 2016 report on corruption  the public protector called mr. zwanes lobbying in switzerland potentially unlawful. last december  a.n.c. delegates from all over the country chose mr. magashule  free states longtime premier  as the partys secretary general  one of the top four positions in the party. mr. magashule had been one of mr. zumas fiercest backers  along with two other provincial premiers who became known in the south african news media as the premier league. they had endorsed mr. zumas chosen candidate as the a.n.c.s next president. but  at the last minute  one of the premiers  david mabuza  switched sides  handing a narrow victory to mr. ramaphosa. afterward  mr. ramaphosa made mr. mabuza  whose province  mpumalanga  became known for political killings and endemic corruption during mr. mabuzas decade as premier  the nations deputy president. with a new president in charge  the national police and prosecutors have started moving against some individuals involved in the dairy farm case. eight people were charged with fraud  and others had their assets linked to the farm frozen. but a judge released most of the frozen assets in march. the next court hearing in the criminal case is scheduled for august. mr. zwane  who was not appointed to mr. ramaphosas new cabinet  has kept out of the public eye in recent weeks. neither he nor mr. magashule has shown any willingness to answer questions about the dairy farm from the news media or parliament  reinforcing the public perception that a.n.c. officials are above the law. what has gone wrong has gone wrong under their watch  said mathole motshekga  a senior a.n.c. official who is a member of the partys decision-making body  the national executive committee  and is also chairman of parliaments justice committee. we expect  and the public expects  that they should take responsibility for what has happened. we are waiting to hear what they have to say  because we dont expect people in such positions to be absentee landlords. but many have given up on the a.n.c. though the money lost in the dairy farm paled in comparison to the scale of corruption inside south africas state-owned enterprises  it resonated deeply across the nation. government money meant to help poor farmers simply vanished  the way it does across south africa  and so far none of the a.n.c. officials in charge at the local or provincial levels have been held to account. as mr. ramaphosa pledges to clean up the south africa he has inherited from mr. zuma  this case will test his capacity to do just that. a spokeswoman for mr. ramaphosa said he was unavailable for interviews. advertisement one of the would-be beneficiaries  adam khatide  55  retired early from his teaching job believing that the vrede dairy farm would take off. in the fallout  he lost faith in the power of his vote. its voting for nothing  he said. just taking people  putting them in office  and then they eat money. when democracy arrived for black people in 1994  mr. khatide drove elderly neighbors to voting stations  where they elected mr. mandela as the first president of the new south africa. we managed to bring democracy  which is not working for us now. its working for individuals  mr. khatide said  laughing. i cannot cry. when im crying  its just the same. its better i

business,advertisement by michael schumanjan. 20  2018  almost a decade after the financial crisis  economies in just about every corner of the world  the united states  europe  even perennially sluggish japan  are growing in unison. but can the expansion last? many economists predict it will  at least into this year. but they also fret that unresolved problems embedded in the global economy  including income inequality and stagnant productivity  could hamper further gains and stall growth once again. as the worlds business leaders gather this week at the world economic forum in davos  switzerland  confronting these issues will be high on the agenda. we will see the momentum created by the recovery continuing into 2018  said shanta devarajan  senior director for development economics at the world bank. but the biggest question is how sustainable that is going to be. that is what we are mostly concerned about. the world bank forecasts that global growth this year will reach 3.1 percent  a slight improvement from its estimated 3 percent rate for 2017. that would be the fastest pace since the post-economic-crisis bump in 2011. while the worlds advanced nations are expected to slow marginally  the world bank projects emerging economies will gain speed  with 4.5 percent growth this year compared with an estimated 4.3 percent in 2017. advertisement the robust rebound has been a long time coming. year after painful year after the great recession  policymakers and economists anticipated a stronger recovery that never came. some economists speculated that the global economy had sunk into long-term stagnation. bouts of turmoil  including debt woes that threatened the eurozone and financial panics in some emerging markets  added to the gloom. last year  though  the world enjoyed what economists call a synchronized recovery among major economies. joblessness has fallen  trade is strong  stock markets are soaring and  perhaps most important  companies have started to invest again  a key factor behind the improved global performance. advertisement in some countries  including the united states  economists expect even better. the world bank forecasts growth in the worlds biggest economy to accelerate to 2.5 percent this year  from 2.3 percent last year. fathom consulting  a london-based research firm  is even more bullish  recently raising its 2018 projection to 3.1 percent  figuring that the newly passed tax reform package will give the economy a short-term pop. yet there is also some concern that the global growth rate may reach its peak next year. the world bank foresees that growth of world gross domestic product will taper off in 2019  to 3 percent  and 2.9 percent in 2020. we ended 2017 with a lot more momentum in the economy than we had expected  said janet henry  global chief economist at hsbc. momentum is likely to slow through 2018. some key regions of the world are already expected to slow this year  including the eurozone and japan. china  the worlds second-largest economy  could lose steam  too. the government announced this month that growth reached 6.9 percent in 2017  but economists generally dont expect the economy to maintain that pace. the world bank predicts a 6.4 percent expansion this year. policymakers in china are facing the difficult task of overhauling the economys growth model to rely more on household spending  which remains low compared with levels in other large economies. traditionally  china has been propelled by high investment  but that has saddled the economy with too many factories in industries such as steel and a mounting burden of debt  now at about 260 percent of national output. most economists do not expect china to tumble into a financial crisis  like other debt-heavy emerging economies have in the past. but beijings efforts to control the problem by curtailing the expansion of credit could dampen overall economic growth. advertisement chetan ahya  global co-head of economics at morgan stanley  considers china one of the outside risks facing the world economy. though he expects that beijing will tread cautiously on tackling debt  tightening credit too rapidly  he warned  could spark a sharper slowdown in domestic demand. you want to ensure that confidence on growth is not collapsing very quickly  he said. once confidence goes down  you tend to see all sorts of challenges. thats not the only danger lurking on economists radar. the recovery has been greased by the extremely supportive policies of the federal reserve in the united states and the central banks of the eurozone and japan. but now  with improved growth  central bankers are expected to reduce these stimulus efforts  a move that could lead to higher interest rates.

programs  which included the buying of bonds on a massive scale  will also be tricky  as any surprises could spook investors and depress prices of stocks and other assets. economists generally say they do not anticipate that central banks will tighten enough to significantly drag on growth in the near term. but an unexpected jump in inflation  beyond current expectations  could prod them to constrain money more rapidly  possibly posing a bigger threat to growth. concerns remain as well about a disruption to international trade  which would be especially damaging at the moment  because strong exports have boosted the current rebound. the worries center mainly on the trump administrations attempts to renegotiate pacts like the north american free trade agreement and possibly take a tougher line on trade with china. the white house has become a risk factor  said andrew kenningham  chief global economist at the research firm capital economics in london. what worries economists more  however  are long-term problems that continue to plague the world economy. through global growth has improved  it still lags behind the pace before the financial crisis  when it increased at around 4 percent or more each year. meager gains in productivity are probably the biggest headache for economists. without stronger improvements  sustaining economic growth becomes far more difficult. economists recommend greater investment in infrastructure  especially in the developing world  which can lower business costs and enhance efficiency  and education and job training  to increase the skills of workers. another issue is widening income inequality within national economies. not all segments of society are benefiting as they probably should from improved global economic performance. even with unemployment rates plunging  in japan  for instance  to a remarkable 2.7 percent  wage growth has still been tepid compared with past periods of economic expansion. because poor families tend to spend additional income more readily than rich ones  the concentration of wealth at the top could be depriving economies of consumer spending. advertisement ms. henry of hsbc said she worried that the income amassed by the worlds wealthiest might be getting invested in bonds  property or other assets rather than investments that could enhance productivity. at the moment  it doesnt look like the savings of higher earners are going into productive investment  she said. income inequality may already be starting to have a negative impact on growth. distorted labor markets  too  need fixing. some countries  including india and parts of the middle east  have labor laws that are so rigid that they discourage employers from increasing staff  condemning many workers to informal and often poorly paid jobs. making it easier and less costly for managers to hire and fire would probably increase incomes and improve the productivity of labor. mr. devarajan of the world bank worries that the robust economy may lead to complacency and delay such critical economic reforms. the time to act may be now  he said. because the costs of not doing it could be very high. a version of this

business,advertisement  breakingviews  by                      peter thal larsen  feb. 22  2016  hsbc shares are being weighed down by fear of the future. the global lender thinks it can bolster returns even as its balance sheet shrinks. that is why it increased the dividend despite a 7 percent drop in underlying pretax profit in 2015. but investors remain more worried about negative interest rates  chinas slowdown and cheap oil. fresh from its decision to keep its head office in london  europes largest lender might have hoped full-year results would offer frazzled shareholders further reassurance. a precautionary $500 million provision for possible bad loans to the energy industry dented earnings. however  half of its $29 billion exposure to the oil and gas industry is to state-owned companies  with major integrated groups accounting for a further 18 percent of the total. despite concerns about china  bad debt provisions in asia were up a fairly modest 7 percent. and though central banks negative interest rate policies have the potential to squeeze bank earnings  hsbc is not yet feeling much additional pain: its net interest margin in the fourth quarter was only three basis points narrower than in the same period of 2014. advertisement true  paying out 51 cents a share to investors when full-year earnings came in at just 65 cents a share looks aggressive. but this ignores the fact that hsbc is simultaneously shrinking its balance sheet. risk-weighted assets dropped by a tenth to $1.1 billion in 2015. as a result  the banks equity tier 1 capital ratio rose 80 basis points to 11.9 percent  even after it paid out $10 billion in dividends. yet investors are unconvinced. after dropping more than 3 percent on monday morning  hsbcs london-listed shares now yield a hefty 8.3 percent  a level that clearly signals that shareholders do not believe the payout is sustainable. of course  any number of concerns could yet throw hsbc off course: regulators might demand even higher levels of capital; or an economic crisis in china could drag down hong kong. advertisement hsbc executives have made it clear that they think these worries are more imagined than real. investors fear the worst is yet to come. they cannot both be right. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
business,advertisement by victoria gomelskynov. 15  2017  switzerland is home to hundreds of watch companies  the majority of which are small  relatively obscure operations that sell just enough to cover their production costs. in contrast  a handful of brands sell more than $1 billion in watches at retail every year: rolex  omega  cartier  patek philippe and longines. how did these five brands gain such outsize importance in the industry? and what do their billion-dollar success stories reveal about the future of the watch business? below  we offer a few theories  based on interviews with industry analysts  auction experts and retailers. all sales estimates pertain to 2016 results  although rolex and patek philippe  both privately owned  dont release figures  and the others belong to publicly owned luxury groups  omega and longines to the swatch group and cartier to richemont  that dont disclose the financial performance of individual brands. with annual sales estimated at $5 billion to $8 billion  rolex is king of the swiss watch industry  with the crown trademark to prove it. but good luck confirming that figure. for all its global name recognition  ubiquitous advertising and well-documented philanthropic efforts  rolex is among the worlds most secretive companies. founded in 1905 by hans wilsdorf  a bavarian living in london  the geneva-based company is wholly owned by the hans wilsdorf foundation  a swiss charitable organization so private that it doesnt even have a website. advertisement no one knows who runs it  said paul altieri  founder and chief executive of bobs watches  a website specializing in vintage and pre-owned rolex models. i dont think they started out purposefully being the greta garbo of the watch industry  but it works in their favor. if they cant control it  they dont want to be a part of it. advertisement in the past  analysts trying to determine rolexs annual production relied on figures reported by the contrle officiel suisse des chronomtres  known as cosc  a nonprofit organization that certifies swiss timepieces for precision. that strategy worked because nearly all of rolexs production is chronometer-certified. earlier this year  however  cosc stopped including brand names in its annual reports  reportedly under pressure from stakeholders. in 2015  the last year for which figures are available  rolex received 795 716 certificates from the group. that tells us theyre producing about 800 000 watches per year  mr. altieri said. multiply that by the average retail value  i think its around $10 000  and you get $8 billion at retail. while the value of rolex sales remains a matter of intense speculation and some dispute  there is virtually complete agreement on one thing: the brand is mass produced with excellence  said paul boutros  head of the americas watch division at phillips  whose oct. 26 sale of a vintage rolex daytona once owned by paul newman earned $17.8 million. auction house officials said it was the highest price ever paid for a wristwatch at auction. rolex is the watch you want on your wrist when youre in a third world country and revolution breaks out and theres only one seat on the plane and theres a guy standing there with a machine gun  said alexander linz  editorial director of the swiss-based website watch advisor. you give him a rolex and he will give you the seat. its kind of its own currency. founded in 1848 in la chaux-de-fonds  the cradle of swiss watchmaking  omega  like rolex  its no. 1 competitor  positions itself as a master of precision in the sports watch category  with estimated sales of $1.9 billion. in 1932  the watchmaker became the official timekeeper of the olympics  inaugurating a multimillion-dollar marketing effort recently extended to the 2032 games. the relationship complements the brands reputation as an industrial powerhouse  second only to rolex in producing chronometer-certified timepieces (511 861 in 2015  another number determined by cosc certificates). it wasnt  however  until the 1957 introduction of the omega speedmaster  a wristwatch originally designed for car racing  that the brand truly hits its stride. then neil armstrong wore a speedmaster on nasas 1969 mission to the moon  ensuring its status in watchmaking history. advertisement the speedmaster  to many of us  represents what a watch should be  benjamin clymer  founder of the influential watch site hodinkee  said on a youtube video that explains the lineage of the model. its sporty  its a chronograph  black dial  manually wound  has great history behind it  this is what watches are about. mr. boutros credits omegas lasting success to its 1999 introduction of an industrialized version of the coaxial escapement  the part of the watch that controls the speed at which energy escapes from the movement. based on the pioneering work of the legendary british watchmaker george daniels  the revolutionary component requires virtually no lubrication  eliminating a major form of wear and tear. the escapement is just one of myriad innovations the brand has unveiled over the past two decades  made possible by omegas access to cutting-edge research and development through its parent company  swatch group  based in biel  switzerland. (swatch owns several component manufacturers  including the movement maker eta and nivarox  which specializes in making hairsprings.) in 2013  for example  omega presented a new seamaster aqua terra watch featuring a first-of-its-kind antimagnetic movement  resistant to 15 000 gauss. (gauss is the basic unit of magnetic flux density.) unlike some other swiss brands  omega has embraced online marketing to great fanfare  such as the online sale of its speedy tuesday speedmaster limited edition in january  when all 2 012 pieces sold within four and a half hours. unlike the other billion-dollar brands  cartier derives most of its success from jewelry  where its name has sparkled since the companys founding in 1847 in paris. thats the backdrop to the watchmakers estimated annual sales of $1.6 billion. the last decade  however  has not been without its strategic missteps. a few years ago  when the watch industry was enthralled with china and its seemingly limitless appetite for luxury timepieces  cartier  flush with cash and perhaps some hubris  seized the opportunity to court men with the introduction of several inventive and highly complicated watches  each priced at more than $100 000.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. today  however  cartier has done an about-face: previous growth was primarily male-driven  more linked to gift giving  said antoine belge  a paris-based analyst at hsbc. growth in the next 10 years in china will come from women becoming increasingly independent financially. (beijings continuing crackdown on gift-giving doubtless has something to do with the change  too.) mr. linz of watch advisor said  cartier will reduce its engagement in mens watches because it turns out that men are not so interested in cartier watches as women. the cartier client wants style  icons  history  emotions. he referred to the revival earlier this year of cartiers iconic panthre collection of womens watches  which now includes an entry-level steel model for $4 000. advertisement this makes it attractive for customers whod otherwise go for a longines  a frdrique constant  mr. linz said. this may push sales down in the beginning  but if the strategy works correctly  it will bring many more hundreds of millions in turnover. if rolex is king of the swiss watch industry  patek philippe  a geneva-based firm owned by the stern family since 1932  may be its (benevolent) emperor. known for its uninterrupted 178-year history of producing mostly mens watches of extreme precision and style  from the coveted perpetual calendar chronograph wristwatches of the mid-20th century to its sporty 1976 status symbol  the nautilus  patek philippe tops the mechanical watchmaking pyramid with an annual production of 58 000 timepieces and an estimated $1.3 billion in sales. mr. belge of hsbc contends that one reason patek philippe has maintained its place among the top five is that it didnt become too obsessed with chinese consumers five years ago. unlike a host of brands that overproduced to supply the chinese juggernaut  and were left with excess inventory when the market began to cool  patek maintained the so-called scarcity effect  he said. thats why their image is still intact. the stern family has done a sterling job of burnishing that image. it embraced the idea of public exhibitions early  staging large-scale pop-up museums in dubai  munich  london and  in july  in new york. during the 11-day event  approximately 27 000 visitors ogled more than 400 timepieces  historic models as well as new special editions. once every 10 or 12 years  we take a break from our very targeted marketing effort and try to encourage and expand the people who know patek philippe  said larry pettinelli  president of the henri stern watch agency  patek philippes american subsidiary. the big question is  how do you get watches on 20-somethings wrists? if any of those young people follow the auction world  mr. pettinellis job will be that much easier. the brand is a sensation on the secondary market  where its complicated timepieces regularly fetch millions. people believe in patek  mr. boutros of phillips said. theyre a good store of value. since walter von knel became president of the swatch-owned longines brand in 1988  the company has taken advantage of its strong positioning in asia to reach an estimated $1.2 billion in annual sales. the thing about watches is that the primary consumer is not american; hes basically chinese  said mr. belge of hsbc. when a brand is doing $1 billion in sales  they usually do less than $250 million in the u.s. probably the only exception is rolex. advertisement despite longines mid-tier pricing  on average  its watches retail for $2 000  its track record of producing respected chronograph movements such as the caliber 13zn  which dates to the 1920s  justifies the brands place among the greatest watchmakers. the architecture of the 13zn chronograph movement was so beautiful and so high-quality that when a. lange & shne introduced the datograph  they used the 13zn as inspiration  said mr. boutros of phillips. longines has a rich history of focusing on accuracy  a fundamental quality of the great brands. by all accounts  the firm also has a secret weapon: mr. von knel  who joined the company as a sales executive in 1969. hes like a mega-computer  said mr. linz of watch advisor. hes perfectly connected within the swatch group  making excellent deals with eta to get special movements exclusively for the brand. what happens when mr. von knel  76  decides to retire? i have no idea  mr. linz said. continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on facebook (styles and modern love)  twitter (styles  fashion and weddings) and instagram. a version of this article appears in print on november 15  2017  on page s2  in the international new york times.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

business,advertisement by reutersmay 1  2018  2:07 p.m. e.d.t.  frankfurt   the incoming boss of basf has thrown his weight behind the chemical titan's contentious strategy of keeping divergent businesses folded into one company  at a time when its major rivals such as dowdupont are breaking themselves up. the comments from martin brudermueller  who will take over as ceo on friday  provide clarity on a key strategic issue that is dividing investors  in marked contrast to predecessor kurt bock who would not be drawn on which path he favored. the german group has grown from a 19th century indigo dye workshop to a diversified juggernaut worth $95 billion. it is the only major western chemicals player banking on an integrated value chain - which it dubs "verbund" - where a company owns businesses throughout the production process. "we often hear the verbund getting criticized for being too rigid. that's not true " said 56-year-old brudermueller. advertisement "if you have everything under one roof  you can coordinate things much better  that is the sense in which we will develop it further. you wouldn't normally want to sell attractive businesses that are growing " he told reuters and other reporters in remarks released late on tuesday. advertisement at its ludwigshafen headquarters and at five other hubs abroad  basf runs close-knit networks of chemical reactors that churn out products as diverse as basic commodities  coatings  vitamins  drug ingredients and engineering plastics. bock  when asked in february whether basf would continue to have diverse businesses under one roof or was considering other options  said the company might learn from what rivals did but did not say which path he favored. both strategies have potential advantages; break-ups can create more focused individual companies and allow stronger units to attract investors unshackled from weaker ones  while an integrated model can reduce costs. u.s. rival dowdupont is planning to break up into a materials science division that relies on in-house basic petrochemicals plants and a specialty products unit selling more differentiated and complex materials. a third spin-off will focus on agriculture. in other recent separation deals in the industry  bayer spun off its covestro plastics unit and is now selling down the shares  air products spun-off specialty chemicals unit versum and coatings group akzo nobel is selling its specialty chemicals division. shareholders split basf competes with dowdupont in areas such as pesticides  engineering plastics  nutrition  insulation foams and petrochemicals. its rival's three-way split will restore basf's position as the world's largest chemical maker but some investors and analysts would rather see it lose that crown. patrick jahnke  portfolio manager at deka investments  which owns basf stock  said he favored the firm selling its upstream petrochemical assets  saying the benefits of physical proximity to downstream operations could be shared with a new owner. advertisement "you can sell the assets but the factory remains in place " jahnke said. "there are many who would pay a high price (for upstream basf assets). private equity would run the business with higher debt and optimized for cash flows and would arrive at a better profitability " he added.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. upstream refers to basic petrochemicals  and downstream to more complex specialty chemicals. a portfolio manager at a top 20 basf shareholder  who declined to be named as they are not authorized to comment publicly on the investment  also saw the merits of a break-up. "downstream  speciality chems could work separately " the manager said. "to de-clutter and reduce complexity ... tends to increase multiples and returns  but german companies are not well known for it." basf has said that sharing logistics  excess energy and by-products within its chemical complexes saves it more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) per year. there are also supporters of the integrated approach among basf's shareholders. arne rautenberg  of union investment  said there was still a lot of value in the model. "the results this year wouldn't have been good without the basic chemicals assets " he said. any move to separating them from the rest "would very much surprise me and i wouldn't be excited"  he added. tale of two sectors basf has been a tale of two sectors over the past year. supply bottlenecks at rivals and strong industrial demand have flung basf's basic chemicals business into a surprise upward cycle. meanwhile  margins of its more complex  specialty products  the group's designated growth drivers  have been squeezed by higher raw materials prices. "if upstream strength dissipates and the downstream margin struggles continue  then we think investor focus will turn to portfolio questions " hsbc analyst sriharsha pappu said in a recent research note. if allowed to strike out on their own  basf units making construction chemicals  coatings and catalytic converters could bolster their earnings and fetch better trading multiples on the stock market  the hsbc analyst said. advertisement brudermueller  a basf veteran  is currently chief technology officer and deputy ceo at the firm  which is due to report first-quarter results on friday. he said that his focus would be on new technologies after taking over from ceo bock  who by contrast had been the company's finance chief before taking the helm and has a background in business administration. the ceo-designate cited cathode materials for car batteries as one area of focus  and also using basf's new supercomputer to speed up discovery of new compounds. "the fact that i have a background in technology and science will result in us having a change in perspective " he said  adding that he would provide an update on basf's strategy towards the end of the year.

business,advertisement by reutersapril 25  2018  2:58 a.m. e.d.t.  london   bank of england governor mark carney surprised investors last week when he hinted that interest rates might not go up next month - but economists say it would be wrong to rule out an increase. 'forward guidance' about central bank policy intentions was carney's signature policy when he arrived at the boe from canada in 2013. yet even now  as he nears the end of his british sojourn  financial markets are still trying to figure him out. "the bank of england has been behaving like the grand old duke of york " said lena komileva  managing director of g+ economics  likening carney to the commander mocked in a british nursery rhyme for leading troops pointlessly up and down a hill. since the second half of last year  the boe has warned that britain's economy is at risk of persistent inflation even as the approach of its exit from the european union causes growth to lag that of other rich nations. advertisement the boe raised rates in november for the first time since 2007  and in february carney and his fellow rate-setters said interest rates might need to rise slightly faster than the bank judged that markets were expecting. advertisement in march  two members of the boe's monetary policy committee voted for a rate rise and economists were confident an mpc majority would back a rise to 0.75 percent in may. this all changed on thursday when carney alluded to "mixed data"  differences of opinion on the mpc and the possibility of rate rises later in the year in a bbc interview. sterling tumbled by more than a cent  short-dated bond yields recorded their biggest fall this year  and financial markets chopped the odds on a may rate rise to less than 40 percent from 65 percent before  according to thomson reuters calculations. <boewatch> previous jolts investors should not lose track of the bigger picture  said mike amey  a fund manager at pimco  the world's largest bond investor  as market pricing of the chance of a may move crept back up to around 50 percent. "whether they hike in may or not is an open question " amey said. "but we think the underlying momentum in the economy is holding up quite well  and therefore that in due course we will see higher rates than are currently priced in for the next couple of years." pimco expects boe rates to rise once or twice both this year and next - compared with the single rate rises in november 2018 and august 2019 factored in by markets. april purchasing managers' surveys from british businesses will probably be more important for the boe's may decision than the weather-affected preliminary first-quarter gross domestic product figures on friday  amey added. advertisement overall  the economy has held up better than most economists expected after the june 2016 brexit vote  despite lagging the global rebound. and the high inflation that hit consumer demand last year is slowing as sterling recoups some of its losses. unemployment has fallen to a 43-year low of 4.2 percent  and a record proportion of britons are in work. komileva said she saw little case to delay a rate rise. "if the bank were to miss may  it would create serious questions about ... what it would take for them to move again " komileva said. the boe's signals on rates felt more arbitrary than those of the u.s. federal reserve or the european central bank  she said.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. fed policymakers make individual projections for rates while ecb president mario draghi regularly offers hints on policy. this is not the first time markets have been jolted by carney. in 2013 the boe linked policy to the jobless rate  only for unemployment to fall far faster than policymakers forecast. and in mid-2014 and mid-2015 carney suggested rates might rise sooner than markets expected - only to backtrack both times. just two months ago  carney had said he felt he could stop giving hints on rates because markets understood the boe's thinking well enough to draw their own conclusions. after that  brexit worries eased as britain secured an outline brexit transition deal until the end of 2020  and economists said signs of economic weakness were the result of freak snow storms  adding to the sense that another rate hike was coming. waiting for wages? the missing piece of the picture for the boe is wage growth  the key factor for inflation pressure. at an annual 2.8 percent  wage growth is roughly in line with boe expectations but remains weak by historic standards  especially given low unemployment. advertisement former boe policymaker david blanchflower thinks the central bank should hold off raising rates and look harder at the number of people in part-time work but who want to work longer hours  suggesting wages are unlikely to pick up sharply. the boe might feel it has more time to see if wages rise after a bigger-than-expected fall in inflation in march. furthermore  sterling's recent recovery should curb inflation pressures. even michael saunders - who voted for a rate rise last month and looks set to do so again - has said the muted response of wages to the fall in unemployment defied simple formulae. for now  economists are still trying to gauge whether carney's comments were a warning that rates are unlikely to rise in may. alan clarke at scotiabank  who has dropped his forecast of a may rate rise  said they were probably intended to stop mpc members feeling they were committed to a hike next month. komileva said they might have the effect of dissuading wavering mpc members from backing a rate rise for fear of wrong-footing markets again. but hsbc economists simon wells and elizabeth martins - who for now are holding with their view of a may rate rise - said they would take the comments with a grain of salt. "not reacting to every word the boe utters has been a good strategy recently. we stick to this."

business,advertisement by chad braymarch 15  2018  london  unilever said on thursday that it would make rotterdam  the netherlands  its sole headquarters  dealing a symbolic blow to britain as it negotiates its exit from the european union. for nearly 90 years  the consumer products giant  whose brands include dove soap  lipton tea  surf detergent  and ben and jerrys ice cream  has straddled the north sea  maintaining headquarters in london and in the netherlands. investors have pushed unilever for years  however  to eliminate the dual structure  arguing that doing so would make the company more agile and better able to pursue mergers. unilever said last year that it would review its legal structure after kraft heinz briefly flirted with a $143 billion takeover of the company. that review has been complicated  though  by britains planned withdrawal from the european union  known as brexit  and fears that the companys decision could be politicized. advertisement critics of brexit have argued that leaving the european union could stifle britains economy  particularly if companies that have used london as a european base decide to move some or all of their operations to the continent in order to stay within the blocs customs rules. advertisement british government officials had lobbied hard to persuade unilever to maintain its london headquarters  in the hopes of avoiding the symbolic blow of a major company being seen to leave the country at a delicate time in its negotiations with european union officials. unilever officials said on thursday that brexit did not factor into the companys decision. the proposed simplification will provide greater flexibility for strategic portfolio change and help drive long-term performance  unilever said in a statement. it said that it would continue to be listed in london  amsterdam and new york  and that two of its three new divisions would remain based in london: beauty and personal care  and home care. the third division would be located in rotterdam. unilever employs about 7 300 people in britain and 3 100 in the netherlands; none are expected to be affected by the structural change. the company also said it would continue to spend 1 billion pounds  or about $1.4 billion  a year in britain  including on research and development. despite the companys insistence that it would keep its presence in the british capital  rajesh agrawal  the london deputy mayor for business  said the decision was clearly disappointing news for the city. it brings into sharp focus the need for the government to secure a brexit deal that secures london as europes leading business center  mr. agrawal added. unilevers two headquarters mirrored its legal structure  in which the company maintained separate stock listings and corporate entities in both countries after its formation by the combination of the british soap maker lever brothers and the dutch margarine producer margarine unie in 1930. advertisement each of the two operating companies technically has its own board  but the boards are made up of the same directors and senior management.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. while unusual  the structure has been used by some of the largest companies with ties to both britain and the netherlands. the oil giant royal dutch shell maintained a similar system until 2005  and relx group  the business information company that owns lexisnexis legal and was formerly known as reed elsevier  dropped its dual structure this year. as consumers have shied away from traditional brands in favor of products from smaller companies with more natural and organic ingredients  unilever has tried to keep pace by buying companies like schmidts naturals  sundial brands and dollar shave club in recent years. nevertheless  simplifying its structure has been a topic at investor meetings for more than a decade. in the end  the unsolicited bid for unilever by kraft heinz  the maker of heinz ketchup and oscar mayer hot dogs  brought the topic to a head. kraft heinz withdrew its offer days later on friendly terms  but unilever said soon after that it would review its structure. as the company pursued a sale of its margarine and spreads business last year  unilever said  it was apparent that our dual-headed legal structure adds complexity when undertaking such changes. unilevers dual-headed legal structure does not technically impede its ability to issue equity or demerge assets  but it makes it significantly more complex  pinar ergun  a ubs analyst  said in a recent research note. the consumer goods company said late last year that its board considers that unification with a single share class would be in the best interests of unilever and its shareholders as a whole  providing greater ongoing strategic flexibility for value-creating portfolio change. unilever had originally hoped to make a decision on its structure by the end of last year  but paul polman  its chief executive  told the financial times in november that the company had decided to delay it amid rising tensions in the negotiations between britain and the european union. advertisement uncertainty about britains future relationship with the bloc has weighed heavily on decision-making by a number of companies as they try to determine how to continue to serve customers in europe. for example  a number of banks  including hsbc  have announced plans to move some employees to the continent in order to be able to serve their european customers seamlessly when britain is set to leave the bloc next year. other companies have announced plans to stay and made new investments in their british operations. toyota said this month that it would make the latest generation of its auris automobile at its plant in britain after announcing an investment of 240 million (about $335 million) in the toyota motors uk business last year. the impact of brexit may be felt in the future not only as a result of what happens in the u.k.  but also as a result of the strong determination of governments of e.u. countries to make their markets more attractive and the new destination for foreign direct investment from multinationals based in the u.k.  said carmen stoian  a lecturer in international business at the kent business school at the university of kent. follow chad bray on twitter: @chadbray. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

business,advertisement by mike ivesjune 14  2017  hong kong  as pink fins surfaced off the boats port side  the canadian college students scrambled toward the bow  cameras in hand  and began snapping pictures. ten oclock! a spotter with binoculars cried from the boats top deck  pointing at the chinese white dolphins that were swimming along the pearl river estuarys shimmering surface. about 100 meters! click. the students were beaming  and they would see about a dozen white dolphins during the recent all-day survey of the waters near lantau  hong kongs largest island. (despite their name  the dolphins often appear pink  thanks to blood vessels just under their skin.) marine biologists say  however  that the long-term survival of the white dolphin  the official mascot of this former british colonys handover to china in 1997  is in doubt. advertisement last summer  workers began an eight-year project to build a third runway in waters beside hong kong international airport. officials say that the estimated $18 billion project will allow hong kong to maintain its status as a global aviation hub and that a marine park should be created nearby after the runway is completed  around 2023  to compensate for the planned destruction of an area of dolphin habitat roughly twice the size of central park in new york city. advertisement but biologists say the third runway will compound the environmental damage of high-speed ferry traffic and other infrastructure projects  including a nearly completed bridge and tunnel crossing that will link hong kong and macau to the chinese mainland. they say hong kong  a commercial center with a british-style legal system and a high degree of political autonomy  appears increasingly bent on destroying its native dolphins through economic development  just as china drove the yangtze river dolphin to extinction a decade ago. its such a terrible image for hong kong that we cannot protect our dolphins because we want even more money  said samuel hung  a biologist who has been studying the estuarys dolphins for decades and has battled the third runway project  unsuccessfully  in court. the population of chinese white dolphins in the coastal waters of the pearl river estuary is estimated to be about 2 500  making it the largest near chinas coast and perhaps also in southeast asia. a report published in march by the scientific journal plos one  based on a four-and-a-half-year survey by university of hong kong biologists  estimated that at least 368 dolphins used hong kongs territorial waters as part of their range. mr. hungs government-financed surveys  which use a different methodology  indicate that the dolphin abundance in hong kong waters  an estimate of how many dolphins are present at any one time  dropped to a record low of 65 in 2015  from 188 in 2003. were at a critical juncture  he said. the airport authority has said that the third runway will significantly expand flight capacity at the airport  which served 70.5 million passengers last year  and provide $58 billion in additional revenue by 2061. supporters of the plan include cathay pacific airways  hong kongs flagship carrier. if there was already a third runway  it would be utilized  said will horton  a senior analyst in hong kong with the capa center for aviation  based in australia. local airlines are not growing as fast as they could  while foreign airlines are waiting to add flights. but critics call the third runway project a white elephant  in part because it is unclear how much airspace mainland aviation authorities will allocate to hong kong in the coming decades  or whether the city airport can even hope to compete over the long term with its mainland chinese counterparts. advertisement albert cheng  an aircraft engineer and former hong kong legislator  said the city should not bother investing in a third runway because it had already been marginalized by china in every aspect and would eventually lose its cachet as asias aviation hub  lowering demand for flights. another issue is whether the projects proponents have accurately conveyed its environmental risks and whether the government should have allowed it to go forward.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe

bears some responsibility because it has adopted the equator principles  a set of standards many institutions apply to ensure the projects they finance or advise do not harm people or the environment. hsbc has been advising the airport authority on the preparation of the environmental information that financing banks will need  when selected  in order to evaluate this project as lenders in accordance with the equator principles  adam harper  a spokesman for the bank  said in response to emailed questions about the runway project and the banks corporate due diligence process. we are committed to the equator principles. the airport authority has said that its marine park proposal is based on international best practices and that noise from construction vessels will not cause long-term harm to dolphins because they are expected to simply keep out of the way  which is an expected reaction by intelligent animals. the authority said in a statement that the proposed marine park was nearly four times the size of the runway project and would pave the way for a rebound of the dolphin population in lantaus northern waters. it would have been impractical to establish a park there during the construction phase  the statement said  mainly because the designation would have precluded building. but biologists say the proposed park would not protect the dolphins from construction-related noise between now and 2023  or cover critical dolphin habitats in lantaus southwestern waters. the saddest thing is that the experts from the airport say  its o.k. for them to leave. theyll come back later  said mak hei man  one of several researchers who conduct dolphin surveys off lantau as part of a government-financed research project that began in the 1990s. but in mainland waters  its even worse  she said  referring to pollution and disturbances. billy hau  a university of hong kong biologist and a member of the citys advisory council on the environment  said that the runway project illustrated the problems with the environmental permit system. advertisement hong kongs environmental protection department has rejected just seven of 249 applications for approval of environmental impact assessments since the permit review process became legally binding in 1998. mr. hau said the process lacked accountability  because it did not allow for public hearings or the formation of expert panels to review especially contentious projects. many people criticize this as unfair because most of the proponents either have a very strong interest in government  or theyre actually government departments themselves  he said. the department disputed this  saying by email that the process allowed both the public and the advisory council on the environment to inspect projects twice. john wang  a biologist at trent university in canada who studies hong kongs dolphins  said that the process had effectively allowed the airport authority to gamble with the dolphins lives. even after the release of an environmental impact study  he said  it remains unclear precisely how dolphins may respond to runway construction noise or to future changes in high-speed ferry or shipping routes. mr. wang said that at some point  the dolphins could become so stressed and confused by the noise in the estuary that they would stop swimming away from noise sources  leading some observers to assume they were unbothered. people will misunderstand that  saying  oh  theyve acclimatized  theyre o.k. now  he said  standing on the deck of the survey boat. no. theyve just given up. a version of this article appears in print on june 15  2017  on page a4 of the new york edition with the headline: paving the way to progress  and maybe to extinction.

capitalism and the entry point into china  which was then closed off from the world. but as china grew  hong kong tycoons like mr. li faded in importance and a new generation of mainland chinese

nauset beach  including the lifeguards focused on the safety of swimmers  missed the great white itself. they saw only the dying seal with its blubbery entrails visible as it swam in hobbled fashion along the surf  leaving a thick trail of blood in the water. that was the end of the beach day as the authorities  now in great abundance  prohibited further swimming. as yet another heralded 10-year

their necks to peer thousands of miles into space missed the startling event just a few feet away. advertisement in retrospect  of course  i should have been more attentive to the water than the sky. anyone entering nauset beach will  aside from the advertisements for liams clam shack  see the ominous signs warning about the preponderance of great whites  and flags hoisted high bearing the likeness of a shark. nonetheless  the parking lot fills up on most summer days. advertisement so it was with the global banking crisis. there were indications everywhere of a system going awry. a decade on  these are the things financial experts and pundits are returning to in a perverse form of celebration. everyone  it seems  has their view about which of these events from early 2007 and into the first half of the following year foretold the calamities to come. but the truth is more complicated. though intellectually stimulating to revisit with hindsight  in isolation none really explained the whole picture in ways sufficient to avoid the inevitable attack. those who experienced the crisis in the trenches of finance  journalism and public policy will continue a healthy debate for as long as they can remember what happened. its worth recalling some of them since we are now in the 10-year anniversary cycle  but with the simple purpose of recognizing that only the sum total of events can provide a real lesson for future avoidance. and even that will be imperfect. its widely accepted that the canary in the coal mine came in early february 2007  when hsbc announced it was taking an extra $1.8 billion in provisions for mortgage loans provided to subprime borrowers in the united states. mauro guilln  director of the lauder institute at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  starts his timeline of the crisis with this event  which inspired a shrewd breakingviews piece questioning whether subprime would be the first shoe to drop.  please verify

earlier  and unusually  acquired a lender focused on less creditworthy customers  many saw it as an isolated case. they didnt need to look much further for other warnings that the shark  to stretch the analogy  would soon devour the seal. new century financial  a subprime lender  was bleeding out for much of the first quarter of the year  culminating in its april bankruptcy. months later  two bear stearns hedge funds investing in poor-quality mortgage assets went bust. by august of that year it had started to become apparent that the problems were no longer isolated to a few buccaneering market participants. the on-air rant by the cnbc commentator jim cramer that the fed is asleep was followed by a notice to investors from bnp paribas that it could not value a bunch of mortgage-related assets in its portfolio because of a complete evaporation of liquidity. within weeks  central banks were injecting money into the financial system. at the annual federal reserve symposium at jackson hole in wyoming that year  its anniversary comes next week  central bankers appeared confident that no systemic crisis was imminent. in a speech titled housing  housing finance and monetary policy  ben bernanke  then the chairman of the fed  said  it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve  nor would it be appropriate  to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions. advertisement despite these jitters  investors remained calm  even complacent. from the week before hsbc burped to october of that year  when ubs  merrill lynch and citigroup warned of some $20 billion of subprime losses  the standard & poors 500-stock index rallied some 10 percent. the complacency rolled on until the troubled bear stearns was swallowed by jpmorgan chase in march 2008. thats an anniversary that will no doubt merit barrels of ink next year  as will the mother of all crisis celebrations with the 10-year mark of the september demise of lehman brothers and the bailouts of american international group and the mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac. each anniversary is an opportunity not simply to remember what happened  but to recognize that no single event can really be said to have predicted  kicked off or ended the crisis. like all collective delusions and manias of crowds  the failure of most investors  regulators  politicians  bankers and  yes  we journalists to identify the danger lurking just below the surface in 2007 only becomes evident by examining the full arc of what occurred. and there is a further lesson  one that the history of market bubbles and financial panics  as well as mideclipse shark attacks  will confirm: we will almost certainly be looking in the wrong direction when the next attack comes around. rob cox is editor of reuters breakingviews. for more independent commentary and analysis  visit breakingviews.com. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think.

business,advertisement by peter baker and peter s. goodmanjan. 25  2018  several world leaders highlighted integration and cooperation as vital for the global economy ahead of president trumps arrival at the world economic forum in davos  switzerland. davos  switzerland  when president trump arrived on thursday at the conference center where the worlds financial and political elite have been meeting  onlookers crowded a balcony and craned their heads to see the leader who has challenged the very international order that davos represents. at first  it was quiet. then someone called out a question. are you going to be treated well? he was asked. you tell me  mr. trump replied. the reverse question was unasked but hung in the air: how was he going to treat them? if he was not exactly entering the lions den  it was nonetheless a fraught moment for both sides as the america first president ventured into the lair of the we-are-the-world banking titans  corporate magnates and international leaders who have spent decades preaching the virtues of global integration. rather than confrontation  both sides labored for conciliation  at least to a point. for one afternoon and evening  at least  mr. trump threw no protectionist grenades and even broached the possibility  however remote  that he would re-enter a pacific trade agreement that he scrapped last year  if it were renegotiated. for its part  the davos crowd welcomed its top critic with a reception and warm words. advertisement the mood was strikingly different from a year ago  when mr. trump was about to take office and the globalists meeting in this mountaintop getaway reeled in shock  panicked that his campaign promises meant the end of the movement they had nurtured for decades. advertisement a year later  many of the business and political elites remain dismissive of him  privately rolling eyes and using words like madman  but there was excitement about economic growth  and the tax cuts and regulatory rollback he has ushered in. the real test of how the two sides will deal with each other will come friday when mr. trump addresses the world economic forum. mr. trumps plan is not to stick his thumb in anyones eye  aides said  but to soberly promote his view that trade should be fair and reciprocal while selling his story of economic energy and soliciting foreign investment. whether he will follow the script  they acknowledged  was anyones guess. the question is whether hes here to be congratulated by the billionaires of davos or to scold them on behalf of the people who elected him  said robert a. johnson  president of the institute for new economic thinking  a research institution in new york. he will act like hes doing both. asked his message for davos  mr. trump said: the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace  and i think thats the message. its been going really well. a lot of people are coming back to the united states. we are seeing tremendous investment  and today has been a very exciting day. davos has never encountered anyone quite like mr. trump. for one week each year  this ski town is transformed into a festival of deal-making capitalism  international wonkery  late-night parties and earnest save-the-world panel discussions. heads of state  corporate chieftains  policymakers and celebrities slip and slide along icy streets to stop in glass-enclosed  tech-heavy spaces set up by countries like india and south africa and companies like facebook and google along the promenade  the main drag. at times  the tensions of the outside world follow them here. the ukrainians were chagrined to discover this year that the space they rented at promenade 73 turned out to be right across the street from russia house at promenade 72. grim jokes ensued about the russians crossing the road to take over a room in ukraine house. unlike other visitors  mr. trump did not wander the pavilions. he attended a reception in his honor by the forum  and then was host at a dinner for about 15 chief executives from firms like siemens  nokia  nestle  hsbc  anheuser-busch and bayer. advertisement as the executives tucked into grilled beef tenderloin or fried swiss pikeperch with purple carrot pure  mr. trump flattered them as some of the greatest business leaders in the world and invited them to talk about their businesses  much as he does at cabinet meetings back home. like his cabinet secretaries  many of the guests volunteered praise of the president and gratitude for his efforts to cut taxes and regulation. the greeting did not surprise everyone. trump made a christmas gift to everyone with those tax rebates  said charles-edouard boue  chief executive of roland berger  a global consultancy with offices in shanghai and munich. even leaders with grievances against the trump administration seemed intent on playing up to him. i found him to be a different person from his public persona  prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi of pakistan said at a breakfast on thursday  recalling their encounter at the united nations  while putting aside mr. trumps threat this month to suspend most security aid because of what he called pakistans lies and deceit in dealing with terrorism. he is a very warm person and he engaged me. an aide to mr. trump who arrived before him expressed astonishment that he was being received so warmly by people he had criticized so harshly. but outside the presidents earshot  there was still plenty of skepticism and concern.  please verify you're

george soros  the liberal financial trader and philanthropist  called mr. trump the vanguard of a new wave of authoritarian rulers that threatens open society. the survival of our entire civilization is at stake  said mr. soros  while pointing a finger at the rise of leaders like kim jong-un and donald trump. in the days before mr. trumps arrival  the leaders of india  canada  france and germany used a series of high-profile speeches to mount an aggressive defense of the global trading system  while other officials worried that mr. trump and other nationalists posed grave risks. the whole world is concerned that the united states is disengaging from the global trade arena  said cecilia malmstrom  trade minister for the european union. im extremely concerned. unlike bill clinton  the only other sitting president to attend davos  mr. trump has threatened to scrap the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada and a separate pact with south korea in addition to the trans-pacific partnership  or tpp  that he withdrew from shortly after taking office. before leaving washington this week  he slapped new tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. advertisement but as he has on immigration in recent days  mr. trump toggled between being hard-line and accommodating. in an interview with cnbc to be aired on friday before his speech  mr. trump raised the possibility of rejoining the pacific partnership  which was negotiated by president barack obama but never submitted to congress amid bipartisan opposition. i would do tpp if we were able to make a substantially better deal  mr. trump said. the deal was terrible; the way it was structured was terrible. if we did a substantially better deal  i would be open to tpp. for other davos participants  more disturbing than his trade views were his utterances on race and gender  most recently in his resistance to immigrants from haiti and africa. its disappointing to be written off by some ill-judged words  said nicky newton-king  chief executive of the johannesburg stock exchange. our exchange is regarded as world class. were completely proud of what were able to do in one of these countries the president is so dismissive of. lynette wallworth  a virtual reality filmmaker from australia who has traveled the world to introduce viewers to diverse cultures  expressed hope that mr. trump would use his time here to absorb challenging points of view. he seems to talk about barriers  she said. he needs to listen to the people who are gathered here  who are trying to make an inclusive world. tolu oni  a professor at the university of cape town in south africa  asked if mr. trump was capable of absorbing opinions that conflict with his preconceptions. i wonder what he will get from this  she said. i hope that in coming here  there is some degree of learning that national interests are not necessarily in contradiction with being a responsible global citizen.

sports,does the name you give your baby shape the person they become? i agonized for months over what to name my children. i wanted to choose something that was short  or at least had a short nickname  so my boys could have the satisfaction of being able to spell it early on. speaking of nicknames  i wanted to avoid ones that would have them teased on the playground through middle school. then there is the question of initials  do they spell out something unfortunate? and the stern factor  can you say it like you mean it when they are in trouble?  its not just first names that are on the table. will the baby take moms last name or dads?  moms as a middle name? a hyphenated version of both? or perhaps you could go the icelandic route  creating an entirely new last name for each child  depending on their gender and their parents first names.  i looked for a name common enough that it didnt try too hard and uncommon enough that they wouldnt be one of a half dozen who turned around when the teacher said it in class. accessible enough that it wouldnt weigh down a small child  solid enough that it would wear well on an adult.  so i named my first son evan  because i didnt know any evans and he could be the only evan; there were three in his kindergarten class.  then i named my second son alexander  in spite of the fact that i knew lots of boys named alex  figuring wed use another form of it as his nickname to help him stand out from the crowd; he is the only alex in his grade.  i have never loved my own name. i seem to share it with every girl born during the 1960s  and even though there are countless numbers of us  i still have no sense of who a lisa is supposed to be. this past year  the most popular name for girls is emma  and for boys  aiden. thousands of parents out there climbing the mental decision trees and pausing on the same cluster of branches.  thats because while we each look for something fresh and original  our feeling for what is new (even if what is new is a return to the traditional) is pulled out of the same encompassing zeitgeist. a generation of sarahs and janes turned around and gave birth to tiffanys and brittneys  who are now going back to basics with emma and sophia and lily. according to babycenter.com (which released the top 100 baby names of 2008  yesterday) the names shooting up fastest in popularity are all traditional ones: sophie (up 15 slots since last year)  oliver (13 slots)  nathaniel and samuel (up 11) and charlotte (up 10). traditional is in unless you are a celebrity. then anything goes. bronx  which is the name ashley simpson and pete wenz gave their newborn son  is ranked at 7058 by babycenter.com  and sunday  the name of nicole kidman and keith urbans daughter is ranked 8781.  right after the election jennifer 8. lee (yes  8 is her middle name  i wonder where that ranks on the babycenter list) wrote about a rash of newborns named barack. after the superbowl last year  babycenter says  there was an uptick in babies named eli and peyton.  what is in a name? a world of possibility.  comments are no longer being accepted. i wanted to name our baby summer since she was due around the summer solstice.  my husband wanted sarah since that is a common name for his family.  we went with sarah  never realized what a common name that is  so maybe she will decide on summer as a nickname. the problem doubles when youre having twins.  then  you have to pick out names that sound good together and are equally popular/strange (i.e. no john and bookshelf). also  is that journalists middle initial really the number eight? what does it stand for? we named my first daughter rory.  i tend to like unisex names  and i also wanted something simple but different.  we have yet to meet another female rory on the playground  although she often has to repeat her name multiple times (lori?  no rory!  huh? r-o-r-y oh!  cool!)   we also liked how it sounded with our last name.  a great baby name book which dissects the phonological importance of names is the perfect baby name (//theperfectbabyname.com/contact.html). we named our 2nd daughter skylar  and we often call her sky. we have met a few boys here and there with similar names  but not often.  the only difficulty has been that she doesnt pronounce her ss very well  so she introduces herself as ky or kylar.  i think that both names are unique but not too strange  so hoping to avoid the playground teasing.  easy to write and spell early on. i have always despised my name.  the recently i realized that it wasnt the name i despised  it was my parents use of it.  whenever it was used  it was in a negative context: actions  posture  failure to do something or other  and a whole bunch of other stuff. recently  at an advanced age  i am returning to the original.  it saves some confusion  and it doesnt let them win. as a mom of a 2 year old  it amazes me how many children share unique names. there are more madisons and addisons  then there ever were of jennifers while i was in school. we actually know a zahara  and more braydens than i can count  although each one is spelled differently. and lets not get started on the made up names  such as chanley (what does that mean) and makenna. there is also a gage and a chace that we know. we are only in gymboree now so we have a small population to pull fromit will be interesting to hear the names of my daughters classmates when she hits first grade.  we went with a less common  but easily pronounceable name for my daughter and i am so glad we did. she is a shelby  and although we have met a few  they are usually older and so excited to meet someone with the same name. i named my son henry because i love old fashioned english names and because he seemed to have an old soul.  surely no one in his school would be named that  i thought  until i was on vacation and met three other henrys at the pool  all born within weeks of each other. now it seems i meet a henry everywhere i go!  i am still happy with the choice  but dont dare call him hank. i think the more interesting situation is faced by immigrant parents who may have to choose between an american-friendly name  i.e. one that is easily pronounceable by native english speakers  and one that is harder to say but more traditional. spelling is an interesting issue to. my name is often pronounced as sa-pa-na although it should only have two syllables  sup-na.  its spelled with three as to account for inherent vowels and its unfortunate (for me and others like me) that english doesnt really have a good way of handling that kind of transliteration. and to add to all that confusion  lets not forget ethnic names from americas non-english speaking communities. for those of us born into south asian families  a common test for a baby name is to ask the nurse at the hospital to pronounce it  just to make sure it wont be butchered in school.  my husbands favorite test for potential baby names is to play the 3rd-grade-bully and see if he can twist the name into some sort of offensive word that would be hurled at our child on the playground. try sheetal for example! youre right about the initials. mine are bs. the middle one is no better  m. bms. what were my parents thinking? but then  maybe they knew something. im in marketing. you neglect to mention the addictive baby name website with interactive tools that let you chart baby names through time: the baby name voyager.  ( //www.babynamewizard.com ).  hours of procrastination when youre pregnant it was on her blog that we got the suggestion for a march madness style of selecting baby names  letting friends and family participate in voting on their favorite baby names.  we used it for our second child (we were more indecisive that time) but then abandoned the most popular choices when it came down to the wire. there is nothing more frustrating than finding out how popular your babys name is  especially when at the time you knew none. whats a mom to do? alison has is right  nicknames. i thought we were being terribly original in picking out the name zoe for my eldest  now 12. she was born in a rural hospital with about eight maternity beds. the nurse asked us what we were naming her and we said zoe sylvia. oh she said theres a zoe olivia right next door! what an interesting topic.  i like my name because its a mix of unique and regular.  i gave my daughter the same quality in her name.  her first name is regular and her middle name is unique.   are you looking for a way to connect with other parents.  check out sahmanswers.com for parenting tips and advice from other parents whove been there. 8 is the lucky number for chinese  and her last name is lee.  im sure that is why. after finding out i was pregnant  i heard the name joanna in a movie  and decided i wanted a little girl named joanna. it wasnt overly popular  but not unusual  either  plus we could call her joey for my dadperfect!  then i found out i was having twins! now to find another not-overly-popular-but-not-too-unusual name  that also complemented joanna  but not in an annoying  sing-song way. i loved the name lorena  but the woman-with-the-kitchen-knife asssociation scared me off; i also liked elena  but saw that it was up-and-coming in popularity  and didnt want my daughter in classes with three other elenas. we settled on marlenaa little unusual  but lovely  we thought. we were careful to spell it with an a on the end so she wouldnt be called mar-leen (we live in texasit would pretty much be a certainty). did i consider boys names? yesjavier and hankor hank and javimaybe its a good thing we had girls my parents named me juno. i have yet to meet another  although just last week i met the first person to have a friend named juno.  and i confess to being relieved that  after all the buzz about the (great) movie that shares my name  it hasnt made an appearance on the top 100 list. now i just have to figure out what to name my own kids. whatever you name the child  be aware of how much a kid can suffer when his/her name is easily ridiculed.  i once knew a child saddled with the name yucca. i wonder if he became a serial killer. then there was the house family. those parents had the sadistic idea of naming the precious infant intrusted to them maxwell. how can people do such horrible things to an innocent child?! and then there are the creative spellings of classic names. these insure that the individual stuck with them will have to spell his or her name hundreds of thousands of times. if her name is to be cynthia  dont make her spell out synthea every day of her life. it gets very tedious. please  please  parents. consider the child. give your son or daughter a name that can be recognised  pronounced  and spelled by almost everyone. spare the poor kid your attempts at being clever. my mother told me she picked my name because the woman she shared a hospital room with  when i was born  had a daughter named cheryl. my reaction to that  of course  was you didnt come up with a name for me until you were having me?! perhaps because of that  i named my children family names. my daughter is actually named after my mother. my son is a jr. now  some people think that the whole jr./iii/iv thing is high-falutin  but i asked every junior i knew how they liked their names and  to a man  they said they liked sharing their name with their father. my daughters middle name comes from a story  dating back to the pioneer days  from my husbands mothers family. pretty cool.  my kids names are ones people recognize when they hear them but they are not on any most popular lists. and we spell them the accepted way. i have never understood why parents take a traditional name and then spell it funny. is that some attempt to be different? the only effect it has is that the child has to spell out his or her name to people  their whole lives. my son liked having a 3-letter name in kindergarten  although he was a little jealous of aj.  he was a little peeved a few years later  though  when there was a ben on every soccer team we play!  (except for that team that had two.)  hes out of high school and ok with it now.  i will never understand the thinking of my inlaws  who named my husband after his father  but according to plan  always called him by his middle name.  it has caused many many small problems for him  and i dont see why the names werent reversed.  one more thing to agonize over  too  is how the kids names sound together.  we thought benjamin and elizabeth were great names (even though one was old testament and the other new)  but didnt realize how similar their eventual nicknames  beth and ben  would be.  and they used it against usbut i thought you said beth!' first  we made a list of all the names that were already in the family and discarded them. we next considered possibilities in light of  the jewish tradition of naming for a deceased family member. we named our first child rebecca  not knowing how popular biblical names would be in that generation. she never used becky. wherever she goes  she meets other rebeccas. in college  she adopted the short form of bec. we named our second child sandra  veering away from the biblical. it is a known name  but not common. for one week  at age 12  she used sandi. she meets other sandras  maybe twice a year. one thing that was helpful in the naming process was that we had adult acquaintances named rebecca and sandra. so  we saw that these was a life-long names that would serve them as children and adults. my personal pet peeve is when folks create atypical spellings for common names: jayne for jane  as an example. when i see a name like that  i wonder to myself did you make that up to call attention to yourself  or did your parents foist that on you? however  i do respect the creativity of the african-american community; such names reflect a political agenda  just as my choice of a biblical name alludes to jewish values. and we have a nephew named evan. my mom was from mississippi and  a devoted william faulkner fan. she named me faulkner in honor him. when i was in grade school  i wished she had named me william instead. in those days  the teachers read attendance using the last name first. i have always hated my name.  im named after a very strange relative  and my own name means alien  which is apt.  i have never fit into my own family. the name itself is bad enough  but the shortened versions of it are much worse.  and trying to tell people not to use any of those versions gets you known as b*tchy.  of course  the alternative  tammy  was even worse.  sadly  i am too well-known in my field to change it. kari #3  we named our second  a boy  flynn.  his older sister (22 months) could not get that fl out  so she called him pin or pinny  which has stuck as an endearment.  of course  i can still hear him  an exasperated toddler  calling her madowen  so madeleine worked against us  too. i hated the name my parents gave me  and changed it at 16. my parents still call me by the name they gave me (youre our daughter  and we named you  and thats that!) hey  its my name  its what people call me  i think i have the right to answer to a name i like. if your kids hate their names  they are likely to let you know it. lots of people change their names over a lifetime  nicknames or shortened versions give way to more formal conventions  names change with marital status (or not)  people go from being bob and jane to dad and mom to bob and jane again. change is good. we thought we were choosing old-fashion  uncommon names but unfortunatly apparently so did everyone else b/c we run into other graces and liams all the time  i still like the names but laugh at myself thinking i was being so cool and original! the motherlode blog has a weekly email. catch up on any essays  posts and columns you've missed along with book reviews and family news from the times and elsewhere  all free. subscribe to the weekly e-mail. we're all living the family dynamic  as parents  as children  as siblings  uncles and aunts. at motherlode  lead writer and editor kj dellantonia invites contributors and commenters to explore how our families affect our lives  and how the news affects our familiesand all families. join us to talk about education  child care  mealtime  sports  technology  the work-family balance and much more each week  we send out a newsletter containing the news and headlines that matter most to parents.     the times is introducing well family  a new online report with expanded coverage of parenting  childhood health and relationships to help every family live well.readmore     i cant promise that our foster son can stay with us  but i can i try to prepare him for the possibility of leaving without adding to his fear. readmore     as much as parents want to know about areas that our children are struggling in  were also wondering what teachers like about them. readmore     by the time children are in middle school  parents should be stepping back. but what if another child wont stop annoying yours?readmore     in november  this family adopted five young children from foster care. readmore the motherlode blog welcomes our new artist-in-residence  illustrator allison steen.   follow her on twitter and on instagram. advertisement 
sports,a man told his neighbor  i just bought a new hearing aid. it cost me four thousand dollars  but its state of the art. its perfect.  really? said the neighbor. what kind is it? twelve thirty  he replied. that joke  courtesy of the web site www.goofball.com  speaks to a sad reality for people with hearing loss. for many of them  hearing aids just dont work all that well. they pick up background noise  squeal with feedback  cant be used over the telephone and are all but impossible to wear in a restaurant. many people quit using them in frustration. thats why i was so surprised to hear about a hearing aid that people like. shortly after the new york giants won the superbowl  i learned about mike waufle  the giants defensive line coach who uses an extended wear hearing aid  and he doesnt hate it. i wrote about coach waufles experience in todays science times. read about coach waufle here  and then join the discussion below. do you or someone you know use a hearing aid? has it made your life better  or do you hate it? comments are no longer being accepted. so if people hate hearing aids  they dont have to use them. i lost 26 percent of my hearing in the army  then i grew old. i bought a hearing aid. nearly $3k. it sits on my nightstand gathering dust. now im returning to the classroom and must have deafness moderation. sounds great if you have plenty of money. how can health insurance not cover hearing aids? seems like it would be tough for people on a fixed income.  i know things will change when this product is more widely distributed  but this part about getting to the clinic is ridiculous. some patients who dont live near a clinic simply fly or drive to a site four or five times a year. simply fly somewhere 4-5 times per year? should be called elite instead of lyric. from tpp  all hearing aids are pretty expensive as is most medical care. the travesty is that hearing isnt valued enough to be covered by insurance. sounds great but how does it function for those of us who produce large amounts of ear wax  a problem normally enhanced by the presence of a hearing aid (i.e.  a foreign body) in the ear? also  id be interested to learn more about the total cost of the lyric  including initial fitting. from tpp  the subscription covers everything. and yes  extra ear wax just means you have to change it more. ive been using hearing aids (both ears) for the past 35 or so years  and i have a love-hate relationship with them. on the one hand theyre an annoying hunk of wires and plastic  always going bad at the wrong time.  ive learned the importance of carrying spare batteries wherever i go  and to change them as inobtrusively as possible.  plus  while they do help improve my hearing  there still are sounds which i cannot hear.  unlike eyeglasses  which correct my vision to normal  hearing aids improve but never correct my hearing. on the other hand  i simply cannot function without them.  they have made possible a quality of life which wouldnt otherwise exist.  those who fuss and fume about the inadequacies of hearing aids might try going without them for a week. the key  in my experience  is finding a provider who can be trusted  who is up to speed with the latest technology  and who has a private practice rather than a franchise.  thats easier said than done  but everything begins with the provider. im anxious to follow the progress of the new lyric as it moves into the mainstream.  please keep us posted. first i have to get rid of my tinnitus. does the lyric help with this?  from tpp  we just wrote a story about this. click here to read. i am 34 year old hearing impaired woman  and yes  i wear hearing aids in most ears. the thing i hate most about them is the whistling when i speak on my cell phone  i actually have to take it out and listen with my naked ear  which is not impossible with the kind of hearing loss i have but very challenging nonetheless. it can be dangerous to remove a hearing aid in the street  its so small that you can easily drop it into a sewer or a puddle or even step on it. ive come close to doing these things. cosmetically  they are very unattractive too  i am married now but when i was dating i was very self-conscious about them  and dont even get me started on what it was like when i was an adolescent. oh  and they make my ears itch. so do i hate them? sometimes. but i am also grateful for this technology that enables me to live a relatively normal life. my hearing loss would be completely debilitating without them. my father  who is now 85  has been totally deaf in one year for many years  and has profound hearing loss in the other. he is unable to hear at all without a hearing aid  and the ones he uses now are (as i understand it) simple amplification devices  with not much selective amplification at particular frequencies because of the extent of his hearing loss. at the same time  as when more than one person speaks at a time  much of what he hears sounds like noise to him  and even appears to cause him physical pain. he is always on the lookout for a new hearing aid  but is often told that the state of the art technology in hearing aids would present no improvement to his hearing. would the new lyric be of use to him? ive been wearing two has for several years. i can hear better  but not well. terribly frustrating. i have two different devices.  left is a resound open device and the other a resound in-the-canal. i have been advised pro and con about two different devices at the same timw.  generally by an audiologist who would like to sell me two more.  at the cost of these things i cant afford to experiment.  any thoughts on using two different devices? pay a subscriptionwhy that wordof up to $3600 a year? i heard that loud and clear! tara: the lyric must be removed by a hook not a magnet.  the magnet is used to set the level of amplification of the device or turn it off.  i have worn the lyric as a test subject in 2 ttrials.  my ear channels are narrow.  i removed the first one within 24 hours and the second one in 1 week.  i could not stand it. there were abrasions in my one  test ear after a week.   a year later  i was called in again to try a different device.  success! one lyric went dead within hours.  but the other was much more comfortable and i was able to wear it successfully for the trial.   the sound is still tinny compared to normal hearing.  i heard more than i wanted to hear or needed to hear with the device in place.   the ear with lyric gets very itchy. after weeks of wear  there is a lot of junk trapped in the ear channel. it would have been ideal if i could have removed it periodically to clean the ear.  but it is inserted/removed by a professional.  i wear hard contact lens and i like being able to insert/remove aids as needed.  i would turn the lyric up when i needed to hear conversations and i would turn it down when i was by myself.  i like that feature alot. if someone can stand the itch and needs to hear well every day in different situations  it is well worth it.   regards  anna reuter palo alto  california it was recently suggested by a doctor that my grandmother research options for hearing aids. she opted for one that cost $4 000  but is still slightly uncomfortable wearing it  especially because she is used to only speaking to my grandfather because she doesnt like going out in public anymore without hearing well. the new hearing aid still causes her problems  she cant hear the television despite the volume and it bothers her when talking on the phone to her grandchildren. like others  she is trying it out for the trial period but will probably return them and get a refund ive been waiting decades for the baby boomer market clout to kick in on the hearing aid issue. the hearing aid industry is a scam.  they sell products for thousands of dollars that should only cost a couple hundred.  the extremely high profit margins are obvious when you see full page ads for a clinicyou cant afford that unless youre making lots of money.  and then the next travisty is the insurance industry that refuses to cover these overly expensive crude devices.  the boomers will find a way to overcome both! i have worn a hearing aid since the age of 4.  i am now 46 years old and wear 2 aids.  my hearing has worsened over the years and in 2001  i adopted a dog to become my service animal.  puffy is a bichon frise pooch.  for those who say that bichons are not service animals  i beg to differ.  the smallness of the breed as well as hearing sounds that i cannot make puffy a well behaved dog for me.  he was certified when he was 14 weeks old and he was just 7 years old last november 2007. i am 35 and wear hearing aids in both ears. i have worn them for about 4 or 5 years now. just after borrowing the money to buy my hearing aids  i was able to accept a job that required me to take meeting minutes; i couldnt have done that job without my hearing aids. as a result of that job  and the ability to finally hear my lecturers in university  i have advanced my career.  but as great as they are  my hearing aids are not perfect.   i still cant hear many sounds  and some sounds i hear too well.  restaurants and concerts make hearing my companions nearly impossible unless i remove my hearing aids.(theres an article  by the way  in why restaurants dont cater to people who like quiet.)  i still miss or misunderstand many words in casual conversation. (sometimes this is amusing  sometimes this is embarrassing  sometimes this is dangerous.)  i get ear infections. (i have to plug my ears in the bath and shower  and must use a vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution to help prevent the infections.)  cell phones can cause painful and annoying feedback. having said all that  as a result of ear infections or necessary repairs  i have had to stop wearing my hearing aids for weeks. without the hearing aids  conversations with friends were difficult  sirens were impossible to hear (instead of just difficult)  and i felt like i was greatly isolated from the world. i also had to explain more often to strangers and remind friends that they must look at me when they are talking to me. this necessary explaination was both embarrassing and exasperating for me.  i would love to try these new lyric hearing aids  but sadly  i will probably never be able to afford the subscription price of as much as $3600. its too bad that hearing is a privilege  not a right  and not even partially covered by my insurance.  then again  maybe the ability of this company to cater only to the rich  charging outlandish amounts of money  is what prompted this innovation. i would say that i hope i am still alive when the price comes down enough to be affordable  but hearing aid prices seem to defy the normal price models for technology. i am very sorry to know that i will probably never be able to experience the new lyric hearing device  but i am glad that i could borrow enough money from a family member to make my life better with the hearing aids i have. ah  another health advance which will be available only to the affluent.   i am grateful to have the use of hearing aids so that i can continue to teach  but  no  i dont love them  they form a barrier only slightly less than the barrier of not hearing. all jokes aside. dont kid yourself. get the hearing checked  and get hearing aid(s)  if you need them  and can afford them. falling rain drops  rustling leaves  ringing bells and phone rings will sound sweeter  and your wife/girlfriend will sound much better. yes  there are problems  as they are with any device mechanical. sometimes i have to remove the hearing aid in order to hear better  they do whistle  and are inexplicably expensive  and become obsolete in 3-4 years. still  i would not like to go without them. even this computer keyboard sounds much better with hearing aids. great comments; especially by the woman who was a lyric test subject.  this solves a problem for a very small segment of the market; those who can afford it and those whose ear canals can tolerate it.  the bigger problem is getting over the stigma associated with hearing loss  not the further concealment of it.  i have a behind-the-ear aid with a cobalt blue metalflake ear mold that i have pierced so i can wear dangly ornaments.  it currently sports a safety pin.  see it at hearingaidsrcool.blogspot.com.  in-the-ear and behind-the-ear aids work marvellously  especially when paired with bluetooth compatibility and fm remote systems  like the smartlink.  we need to move past the shame of hearing loss and start being smart consumers of technology  without worrying about whether it shows. ive worn hearing aids since the age of 5  and im now 28 years old. in those 23 years ive had 4 sets of hearing aids. i find it very patronizing to go to an audiologist and have them trying to push a new model on me every time i go. i understand that the technology is improving with each passing year  but as a young professional in new york  i simply cant afford to shell out several thousand dollars every few years on hearing aidsalthough i also cant afford to live without them. the bottom line is hearing aids are just an aid; they arent a solution to the affliction of hearing loss. i wish the world of audiology would turn their focus to hair cell regeneration instead of pushing expensive hearing aids onto people. theres no substitute for real hearing at some point in my life  i would love to experience it again! your article was personally interesting.  i couldnt tell what kind of hearing loss coach waufle has.  there is no generic type of hearing aid for hearing loss. my four year old phonak perseo bte hearing aids vastly improved my hearing.  i dont hate them but they are not without many challenges.  these include being at the mercy of the audiologist doing the programming  having to remove them to shower and swim  keeping them in a dehydrator at night.  the things were expensiveover $4000 for the pairand they were only guaranteed for 3 years.  so with my present aids nearing the end of their life  i jumped on the article to find an alternative.  except for the cost (yikes!) and their extended use option  your article was not very helpful. well  i recently got two hearing aids.  although i have some hearing loss  it is not severe  just annoying at timesfor others and for myself.  the problem is that i dont wear them!  i simply cannot seem to get in the habit of putting them in everyday.  some days i am just at home all day feeling like i dont need them  and then when i do go out  i forget about them.  they were very expensive  so im upset about this.  im going to keep trying  but im not sure what to do about this. thanks for a cogent  reasonably comprehensive article on a burgeoning boomer issue and social problem. hearing loss is isolation personally  exclusion professionally for many. truly an american scandal that it isnt treated as the occupational [and insurable] handicap that it is. the hearing aid sales business is amazing.  where else can you look for a product that costs $3000 -$6000  not be able to try it on first  and have a restocking fee of $400 if you want to return it. my audiologist (ex-audiologist) is in a major nyc hospital. i recently went to get my $3000 (one ear) diva replaced. he immediately wanted to sell me at bte pair for about $5 000 and tolde all the things that were wrong with the diva  which he could have told me three year ago when i bought it.  im about to take a chance with a web company that offers a full refund and a resonable trial period. the new york audiologist never tested the diva in my ear;  so i dont see any problem of letting the web company do it  based on a hearing test sent from  new york.  well see. to those who wear hearing aids: is it possible to enjoy music (classical  especially) with them?  from tpp  the last anecdote in my story was from someone who was listening to an orchestra and thrilled to hear all the notes  including the triangle. tara  thanks for this space to make comments on this article. as someone who has worn hearing aids for about a decade now  their lousy reputation is mostly deserved. they are generally very expensive and even the newer ones amplify all sounds  sometimes making for sometimes painful hearing experiences. the new lyric hearing aid is no panacea for those of us with serious or profound losses. ann in comment #11 gives us a somewhat more balanced look at the pros and cons of this new device. it will only be appropriate for a subset of those with hearing losses. having said that  i have been waiting for the boomers and older members of the  silicon valley techie crowd to start exploring the design and manufacture of new  innovative hearing technologies. one that i can imagine that may be in reach soon is what i will call the robo-speech-detection glasses. here is how it would work. a small microphone or two would pick up the speech of the person you are listening to. a small set of microprocessors would turn that speech into text. that text would be shown either at the bottom (or the top  your choice) as scrolling words on the lenses of a pair of glasses you would wear.  as you watched the person speak  you could glance down to help decipher words you could not understand. later  translations of foreign languages may be possible with such an approach. such glasses would alleviate embarrassing conversational lapses those of us with profound hearing losses must now suffer even with hearing amplification.  to don in comment #9: you should go to a good audiologist for a consult. wearing two different types of hearing aids seems odd to me  but your hearing problems may lie elsewhere. you may even want to go to a good eye  ear  nose and throat doctor who has audiology testing equipment. finally  to susan in comment #21. your hearing loss may not be severe enough yet for you to begin wearing your hearing aids. also  you may be in denial of your problem. i still was in denial about my hearing loss well into my 5th year of knowing about it and wearing hearing aids. it is a blow to our egos  and a reminder of what we have lost as youth slips away. and hearing loss carries quite a stigma with in our society. your health questions answered by times journalists andexperts. your questions | all  get well's running email for practical tips  expert advice  exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey. coming soon. advertisement 
sports,one of the more memorable commercials broadcast during the super bowl on sunday night featured a bevy of pop culture icons from the 1980s  including hulk hogan and the actor john ratzenberger. inside metlife stadium  meanwhile  there was a 1980s tableau of a different sort  albeit one that would appeal mainly to connoisseurs of wall street news and culture. henry r. kravis  the prominent financier who co-founded kohlberg kravis roberts  was spotted in a box seat next to the actor michael douglas  who as gordon gekko in oliver stones 1987 film wall street famously declared: greed  for lack of a better word  is good. mr. kravis  while not nearly as widely known as mr. douglas  reigned in the 1980s as a real-life prince of wall street. he earned a place in popular culture after orchestrating the leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco in 1988  a story that dominated the headlines and was recounted in the book barbarians at the gate. in the film version of the book  mr. kravis was portrayed with quiet intensity by jonathan pryce. why were mr. douglas and mr. kravis sitting together? the reason is probably fairly straightforward. the two men are friends from their boarding school days at eaglebrook school in deerfield  mass. still  when the duo appeared on tv during the second half of the game  a number of twitter wits took note. henry kravis sighting next to michael douglas in box.  andrew ross sorkin (@andrewrsorkin) 3 feb 14 that was billionaire financier henry kravis next to michael douglas. #kkr #wallstreet #greedisgood  peter lattman (@peterlattman) 3 feb 14 henry kravis sitting with michael douglas at the #superbowl. wall street.  david gelles (@dgelles) 3 feb 14 what on earth are henry kravis and michael douglas talking about at the super bowl?  rob cox (@rob1cox) 3 feb 14 gordon gekko & henry kravis at #superbowi. gekko to kravis: think we could lbo the nfl? kravis: if we fire peyton //t.co/enjegwutnl  andrew ross sorkin (@andrewrsorkin) 3 feb 14 side note i was just mocked mercilessly for shouting out henry kravis! henry kravis! and not knowing that was michael douglas.  hillary canada (@h_canada) 3 feb 14 advertisement 
sports,advertisement by julia chaplinjan. 29  2006  spending time on the north shore of oahu  just 30 miles from the urban sprawl of honolulu  provides a crash course in the hang-10 lifestyle. old surfboards serve as signposts for the driveways of wooden bungalows  the fronts of shops and the turnoff points for restaurants at this fabled surf mecca. even the barbecue delivery car has a surfboard strapped sideways on its roof as a makeshift billboard. there is hardly a waiter  store clerk or bartender around who doesn't have a ripped physique  a sun-burned nose and flip-flops barely encasing scraped-up feet -- all signs of the hard-core surfer. out in the lineup  in the calm water just outside the break where throngs of surfers jockey to catch waves  it is not uncommon to see hawaiian grandmothers longboarding among teenagers covered in tribal tattoos doing aerial maneuvers. pro surfers  especially those who grew up on the north shore  rule the hierarchy. local surf stars like fred patacchia  pancho sullivan  jamie o'brien and megan abubo  who was the stunt double for michelle rodriguez's character in the film "blue crush " can be spotted hauling groceries to their trucks at the parking lot at foodland or at haleiwa joe's  the north shore equivalent of the ivy in beverly hills  where pros and potential sponsors dine  and contest victory celebrations are held. on a recent morning at cafe haleiwa  decorated like all restaurants here with old surf photos and paintings of giant barreling waves  ms. abubo  tanned and muscular  was fielding calls from producers for television programs and commercials looking for stunt doubles and pro surf specimens. "the north shore is a little like going back in time " ms. abubo said. "even though the crowds have tripled in the last few years  people still hitchhike to get around  and there's a tightknit community. it's the best place in the world for a surfer to live." advertisement the north shore is now in a rather sticky situation of courting fame while trying to preserve an old-school  precrowd vibe. the throngs began to show up  boards under arms  soon after the release of "blue crush" four years ago. the drew barrymore-adam sandler film "50 first dates " episodes of "baywatch" and the wb reality series "boarding house: north shore" were all recently filmed here. advertisement and the primetime hit "lost" -- its base camp in the tropical vegetation between haleiwa  the historic town founded by missionaries in the 1800's on the southwest end of the north shore  and waimea bay -- has set scenes on dozens of the coconut-strewn sandy beaches and thick jungles here. (an amusing pastime for fans is to ferret out locations like the site of a plane crash scene  which was shot just to the left of a y.m.c.a. camp on farrington highway.) yet  its hollywood connections aside  the feeling at this seven-mile stretch of world-class surf breaks and rolling  grassy fields  is like that of a junior high  where the cool kids are surfers and the nerds are outsiders (especially tourists) who don't possess killer tans and/or deft surfing skills. "even celebrities who come here  like owen wilson or brian grazer  get dropped in on in the lineup " said leah metz  a surfer and massage therapist  who was standing in a bikini scoping out the action at the laniakea break with her friend ms. abubo on a recent mid-morning. so far  the local community has succeeded  to a degree  in maintaining its surfing heritage. there are no high-rise condos  only one resort hotel and just a handful of small guesthouses. residents recently stopped a developer's plan to construct a 55-store shopping mall  and the north shore community land trust  a collective that includes the pro surfer kelly slater and the musician jack johnson  has helped to raise $7 million to preserve a 200-acre parcel that overlooks sunset beach and banzai pipeline. this is hardly the strip's first brush with fame. hawaiian royalty braved the swells on impossibly long wooden surfboards hundreds of years ago  but it wasn't until the late 1930's that a few surf pioneers living in honolulu began trekking over in search of bigger thrills. the area was rugged country sparsely populated by farmers and plantation workers  and the waves  which can charge upward of 20 feet in the winter months and once every few years to a heart-stopping 40 to 50 feet  were considered unridable death wishes. (in fact  one 17-year-old surfer  dickie cross  drowned in waimea bay's 35-foot surf in 1943  warding surfers off for more than a decade.) all that changed in the late 1950's  when a group of california daredevils including pat curren  mickey muoz and greg noll  the founder of greg noll surfboards  known for barreling down giant faces in jailhouse-striped swimming trunks  dared to paddle out. they were youthful counterculture rebels living in rustic shacks on the beach  defying nature just for kicks  all with mischievous smiles and beers in hand. their images  documented in surf magazines and movies  wowed the gidget-fueled surf craze that was sweeping the nation  and the lineups have been clogged ever since. "surfing wasn't about money back then " said mark cunningham  a retired north shore lifeguard and renowned body surfer. "surfers always lived cheaply and scraped by." though the north shore is a year-round destination for tourists  the surf culture peaks for a month each winter at the ever-popular vans triple crown of surfing  a series of three surf contests founded in 1983 that is the extreme sport equivalent of the superbowl. (last year's contest ran from nov. 12 to dec. 20 with andy irons winning the title. he dedicated it to his friend malik joyeux  a 25-year-old pro from tahiti who died surfing pipeline last december.) ke-nui road  a dirt alley with puddles and tropical overgrowth between sunset beach and banzai pipeline  the surfer's 90210  is where the action is. during the contests  which draw thousands of surf pilgrims  groupies and fans  surf apparel companies like volcom  billabong and roxy rent out oceanfront homes for their pros and throw frat-like parties -- a sort of beach version of street marketing. advertisement the more out of control  the better the branding -- such as the rager at rip curl's rental during this past year's contest  described on surfing magazine's web site: "brilliant. beers and broken bottles on the floors. condiments everywhere. holes in the walls. then someone came up with the awesome idea of throwing eggs into the ceiling fans so the yokes splattered everywhere. yeah  wreck the place  boys. sick fun." a typical day on the north shore begins early  around 7 a.m.  as surfers start trolling the kamehameha highway  the busy two-lane main drag  for a swell. (it's easy to judge where the conditions are best by the number of cars and bicycles parked along the side of the road  which has no crosswalks and can take up to 10 minutes to get across.) on a day when the swell is pumping  photographers line the beach  as ambitious up-and-comers and pros such as kelly slater or andy and bruce irons show off with tailslides (a cutback maneuver on the top of the wave)  360 turns and green-room tube rides (when the surfer moves through the hollow barrel of the wave). the crowds tend to thin out in the scorching midday sun  which can be the only time for newbies to paddle out and actually catch a wave. many of the surfers return just before sunset  when the wind generally dies down  the temperature is cooler and more civilized  and the texture of the water is glassy. surfers tend to go to bed early  so they can do it all over again the next day  except on thursday evenings  when the action is at breakers  a restaurant and bar owned by the family of the pro surfer benji weatherly in haleiwa. here young men try to impress girls with tattooed navels with tales of surfing prowess. (women who surf are no longer a novelty.) "just don't do anything stupid and its fine " said garrett mcnamara  the current world champion of north shore tow-in surfing championships  who grew up in the rough north shore town of waialua. "but if you don't pay respect  especially in the water  you might get a beat down. sometimes when locals get drunk  they express how they feel about howlie." (howlie is the hawaiian slang term for white people  or in this case  white tourists.) one way to blend is to share accommodations with a handful of surfers. the bulletin board outside of foodland  the main supermarket  is a great resource. (a recent posting read: "mellow  employed  stable people only. no drugs. $600 per month.") and  of course  there are always the hand-scrawled room-for-rent signs posted outside the occasional home along kamehameha highway.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the lack of a tourist infrastructure seems only to have made the place more endearing to surf aficionados and travelers fleeing the overpampered experience at resorts with infinity pools  aromatherapy and evian spray canisters. defunct pineapple and sugar plantations turn into rambling pastures lush with palms and tropical flowers  while grazing horses and goats dot the landscape. famed surf spots line the coast like the stars on hollywood boulevard -- waimea bay  sunset beach  off the wall and velzyland  with their awe-inspiring waves.

sports,advertisement by jer longmanjan. 28  2011  when b. j. raji nimbly intercepted a pass and shimmied in the end zone last sunday  helping to put green bay into the super bowl  the feat was remarkable given that raji is a nose tackle and  at 337 pounds  is thought to be the largest player to score a postseason touchdown in n.f.l. history. forty-four years ago  when the packers won super bowl i  their largest players weighed 260 pounds. as green bay prepares to face pittsburgh in super bowl xlv  13 players on the packers active roster weigh 300 or more pounds  reflecting a trend over the past several decades in which players have become as supersized as fast-food meals. in 1970  only one n.f.l. player weighed as much as 300 pounds  according to a survey conducted by the associated press. that number has expanded like players waistlines from three 300-pounders in 1980 to 94 in 1990  301 in 2000  394 in 2009 and 532 as training camps began in 2010. on one hand  the largest players are celebrated for their strength  spry athleticism and beer-belly physiques that give them an everyman quality. advertisement on the other hand  the enormousness of many players  and the recent deaths of one active lineman and several relatively young retired linemen  have raised questions  and brought conflicting answers  about potential health risks associated with size. various studies indicate that current n.f.l. players are at a greater risk than the general population for high blood pressure and that retired players are more prone to obesity  sleep apnea and metabolic syndrome: conditions like elevated blood pressure  insulin and cholesterol levels and excessive body fat around the waist that together heighten the risk for heart disease  stroke and diabetes. retired linemen have been linked to higher mortality rates than the general public. advertisement i just cant see how they can be healthy  said dr. charles yesalis  an epidemiologist and professor emeritus of health and human development at penn state. yes  some may be 280 pounds of muscle  but then they carry 40 pounds of fat. it just overworks your heart. it puts a strain on your joints. you have the whole issue of concussive injuries. it all adds up to things that are not good for your health  but it makes for a good carnival atmosphere when you see the behemoths out there. a 1994 study conducted by the national institute for occupational safety and health found that retired players had a lower mortality rate over all than did the general population  but that former offensive and defensive linemen had a 52 percent higher rate of death from cardiovascular disease. since then  the players have only grown larger; the average n.f.l. weight is now 252 pounds. a 2005 study by the university of north carolina found that more than a quarter of the n.f.l.s players fit the category of class ii obesity  which is between moderate and morbidly obese. a 2006 survey by scripps howard newspapers of the deaths of 3 850 professional pro football players over the last century found that the heaviest players were more than twice as likely as lighter players to have died before their 50th birthdays. the n.f.l. disputed the methodologies of the north carolina study and the scripps howard study. a 2009 study of 504 active players  funded by the league and published in the journal of the american medical association  indicated that during their careers  players  on the whole  did not appear to be at a greater risk of heart disease than other men their age. the study said that n.f.l. players had similar cholesterol levels and healthier blood-sugar levels and were less likely to smoke than the general population. black players did not show higher cardiovascular risk than white players. the study did find  though  a higher likelihood over all of elevated blood pressure and borderline hypertension. advertisement the question is  if you are an elite athlete  can you be healthy at 300 or 350 pounds? said dr. robert a. vogel  a cardiologist and professor at the university of maryland school of medicine and a co-chairman of the n.f.l.s subcommittee on cardiovascular health. the simple answer is  being physically active is unquestionably a deterrent to the problems associated with weight. having said that  are you at higher risk being a 350-pound lineman than a 210-pound quarterback? yes. another 2009 study  published in the american journal of cardiology  found that retired n.f.l. players had significantly lower occurrences of diabetes  hypertension  sedentary lifestyles and metabolic syndrome than did nonathletes. despite their larger body size  retired n.f.l. players do not have a greater prevalence of heart disease risk factors when compared to the general population  the studys lead author  dr. alice chang  an assistant professor of internal medicine at the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas  said in a statement that accompanied the study. the n.f.l. began to put a premium on weight in early 1980s  with the success of the washington redskins and their offensive line  known as the hogs. rule changes also allowed offensive linemen to use their hands more in blocking. you need to be physically strong enough to do this job  said howard green  a 365-pound defensive end for the packers  whose defensive front is the largest in the league. thats why so many of us are the weight we are. performance-enhancing drugs have also clearly played some role in the larger size of players  though it is impossible to say precisely how much. almost no players admit to using banned substances  and the n.f.l. does not test for human growth hormone  though commissioner roger goodell has said such testing was needed to protect the integrity of our game. the issue of health and player size came to the forefront after the death in 2005 of thomas herrion  a 6-foot-3  310-pound offensive lineman with san francisco who collapsed and died after an exhibition game. a coroners report said that herrions death was caused by heart disease that left a significant blockage in his right coronary artery. reggie white  a 300-pound hall of fame defensive end for philadelphia and green bay  died in 2004 at age 43 of cardiac arrhythmia  with sleep apnea a possible contributing factor. frank warren  a retired defensive lineman with new orleans  died in 2002 of a heart attack at age 43  five days after an interview with the hbo program real sports about the cardiovascular risks of obesity associated with n.f.l. players. another retired 300-plus pound defensive lineman  norman hand  who last played with the giants  died last may of hypertensive cardiovascular disease at age 37. warren  who also had drug problems  told real sports  looking back  i dont know if i would change or not  money  the glory  knowing that im better than the next guy  that i can beat him at will. advertisement the n.f.l. offers sophisticated and free cardiovascular screenings for retired players and urges them to exercise and eat sensibly. mark murphy  the packers team president  who played safety for washington during the hogs era  said: i think the smartest players are the ones that lose weight right away. its not easy going through life that way. ryan pickett  a defensive end for the packers  said he found it difficult to get below his current 338 pounds. my problem is  i can go up too easily  he said  adding that upon retirement  i want to go lower than this  i dont know how much  exactly  but a lot. some players are not waiting for retirement to shed weight. last april  max jean-gilles  a guard with the philadelphia eagles  underwent gastric lap-band surgery after his weight swelled to nearly 400 pounds following an operation to correct an ankle injury. he played this past season at a listed weight of 358 pounds. i didnt want to be 400 pounds after football  then have heart problems  jean-gilles told reporters after the gastric surgery. i said  oh  man  i cant live like this. i was breathing heavy. the issue of weight and heart risks has spread even to high schools  where studies indicate that more than half of linemen are overweight. some medical experts have called for weight limits on players  though that seems unlikely in the immediate future. even so  some former n.f.l. linemen wonder whether it is really necessary to weigh 300 pounds to play effectively today. you can see by looking at the defensive linemen that they carry 30  40  50 pounds of fat  said jerry kramer  the all-pro guard who led the packers famed sweep in the 1960s while playing at about 250 pounds. fat doesnt make you strong and quick. it makes you heavy. muscle makes you strong. weve gotten enamored with the 300-pounder  but give me an offensive guard whos in great shape at 270 or 275 and understands leverage and positioning  and ill bet hell whip the fat guy every time. rob reischel contributed reporting from green bay  wis. a version of this article appears in print on january 29  2011  on page d1 of the new york edition with the headline: superbowl xlv; tipping the scales over.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,updated  july 8  11:30 p.m. | yoshiaki sato  a scholar based in japan  joins our discussion and notes jacksons contribution to the visual culture of pop music. as crowds gathered in los angeles on tuesday morning for michael jacksons memorial  sections of freeways were shut down as the funeral procession made its way to the staples center. more than 1.6 million people registered online to win tickets to the service. several european broadcasters cleared their schedules to show the event in prime time. in death  michael jacksons celebrity seems likely to exceed his popularity even at the height of his fame. given his musical legacy  is this reaction overblown or deserved? does this spectacle say something beyond a public fascination with his story and the ability of his managers to turn a funeral into a superbowl-like event?    john mcwhorter  a senior fellow at the manhattan institute  is the author of our magnificent bastard tongue: the untold story of english.  we got over ed mcmahon a good while ago now  and the scattering of farrah fawcett magazine covers already looks a little 10 minutes ago. what keeps us from getting over michael jackson is partly  of all things  his blankness. the surgery  the falsetto speech and the costumes were someone keeping himself at a distance. we saw a ghost who could sing up a storm and dance better  but so weightlessly in both cases  with the airy voice and always the moonwalking. he was so willfully nonspecific that he became a distillation of brilliance of no race  gender or age  just mesmerizing. his art inhabited the real world only in a gestural sense. lets face it  as good as the songs are  the person snarling beat it has never been in a fight  and its hard to imagine the singer of billie jean fathering anything. all of america could love him  because he made sure not to actually be anyone. it was a fascinating trick and it sticks with us. and what he put himself through to pull it off makes his passing even harder to get over. to black people  the bleaching and chiseling was the tragic self-negating behavior of our wide-nosed boy singer with an afro  grown up and lost. but whites have opened up to blackness to such an extent that they were often just as dismayed by the surgery. cosby became a runaway hit  will smith became hollywoods biggest star  hip hop went mainstream  america elected a black president  and michael died looking like greta garbo. sixty years ago most whites would have wondered why more black stars didnt do what he did. today they mourn him as someone who couldnt face what he was  because they would have loved that  too  or at least given it a shot. in that  our current michael-mania  like obamas election  embodies what america in 2009 is all about.  margo jefferson  a former culture critic for the times and winner of the pulitzer prize for criticism  is a professor at eugene lang college  the new school for liberal arts. she is the author of on michael jackson. a simple fact: our reaction to any and every celebrity death is overblown. the media and its consumers (we the fans  the spectators  the commentators  even the dissenters busily blogging their disapproval) are locked into a feverish ritual. its elements? true grief  a certain relief (we wont have to keep worrying about his life)  and pure voyeurism. (bring on every seedy detail and speculation!)  an embarrassing fact: the ritual of alternately mourning and gossiping about a dead celebrity is a shamelessly welcome relief from knotty political and economic issues. a friend of mine saw a headline that read: michael jacksons death is bad for iran.  it was. that being said  when it comes to great pop culture  which all the world cares for  is there any more spectacular figure? michael jackson the entertainer contained multitudes. he was part of the soul-music tradition that included james brown  jackie wilson  smokey robinson and sly stone. he was part of a stage and screen tradition that produced josephine baker  fred astaire  sammy davis jr. and judy garland.  who better expressed so many contradictions  struggles  achievements  questions  ambiguities  transgressions  about race and gender? about our obsession with youth  with the innocence and eros of children; that oh-so-american drive to reinvent and transform our bodies  our lives and our selves?  theres almost no major cultural story michael jackson hasnt starred in for nearly 40 years.  mark anthony neal  a professor of black popular culture at duke university  is the author of several books including new black man.  his essay can you remember? is featured in a recently released michael jackson box set  hello world: the complete motown solo collection. michael jackson and the jackson five were products of the early moments of the post-civil rights era of the 1960s. part of what was so significant about their successes  the hit records  the sold-out concerts  the saturday morning cartoon  the teen fanzine that they helped spawn  was their crossover appeal  which was not unlike that of their record label motown. by the time michael jackson stepped forward on his own with recordings like off the wall (1979)  and thriller (1982)  his generational peers were of an age where they could fully appreciate what it meant for an african-american man to achieve the level of mainstream appeal that jackson did.   lost in his unprecedented celebrity was the multicultural  multiracial and multi-ethnic component of his audience  and few artists before or after could ever claim such a following. at his peak  michael jacksons celebrity  like his music  had transcended simple labels; the king of pop was apropos.  as his career transcended national borders  michael jackson became a coalescing symbol of global community. a decade before the internet  his music and moves formed the lingua franca of that community.  many of those fans (im sure new york congressman peter king was never among them) surely tired of the sideshow that jacksons life and  to a lesser extent  his career had become. the outpouring of emotion that weve witnessed since his death and so visibly on display in los angeles today may have less to do with jacksons musical legacy  singular as it is  as  with the remembrance of the beloved community that he symbolized.  its not surprising to see how such a community is reconstituted via facebook and twitter and other social networking sites.  it suggests that as the demands of our everyday lives push us in so many different and conflicting directions there are still needs for human contact and shared experience.  michael jackson was  perhaps  the most powerful symbol of those needs.  bonnie fuller  the founder and chief executive of bonnie fuller media  is the former editorial director of american media inc. and the former editor in chief of us weekly  glamour  cosmopolitan  marie claire and ym magazines. michael jackson  like princess diana  has proven that the tragic and completely unexpected passing of a superstar familiar to billions can create an emotional unifying experience for millions. and as human beings  we like experiences that have the power to emotionally unite us with each other. in normal everyday life  we mostly stick to pleasantries or business-type discussions when talking to all but our closest friends and family. those conversations dont allow for any special bonding with each other. then along comes an event that is so stupendous  so unexpected  involving a celebrity of enormous fame that we all know and hold shared fond memories of  and it jolts us out of our everyday constraints. it doesnt matter who we talk to  a friend or a stranger in line at starbucks  we can suddenly  without any normal hold-backs  just share our thoughts  about michael jackson. share our shock  our regrets at his passing. the fact that michael jackson sang the songs that were the background music for so many of our growing-up experiences  gives us the basis for this connection. its impossible for almost everyone of certain generations in western-influenced cultures not to feel the enormity of the loss of his talent  or to wonder what might have been if he had been able to make the comeback he hoped for. ultimately  being able to share our collective grief is a cathartic and hugely satisfying experience for us as human beings. yoshiaki sato has taught american literature and popular music at the university of tokyo and elsewhere. his various publications include japanese translation of thomas pynchons vineland and gregory batesons steps to an ecology of mind. when mtv first appeared and music needed a clear visual definition  michael jackson was right there at the frontier. his thriller album defined an entire pop culture  and destroyed forever the idea that music is only for listening. michael  along with the rest of the 80s bunch  made pop music easy and spellbinding to watch. after that  the makers and deliverers of music were able to announce to a global audience  to borrow a phrase from michael  we are the world. indeed. just watch michael on stage in bucharest at the 1992 dangerous world tour. watch the radiant eyes and the bouncing bodies of that enormous crowd and how mesmerized they were by his presence.   michael may have been a bigger force in history than all the unused hydrogen bombs. his moonwalk may have been a bigger leap for mankind than apollo 11. just imagine one billion people on earth having watched one minute of michael every day for 15 years of their lives. altogether that would make some 90 000 000 000 total hours of attention. this is power. and its potentially a huge  efficient  cultural  and political power. comments are no longer being accepted. for me  and i suspect for most people  its the music.  it is absolutely addictive and can move even the most serious people. mj rocks! money  pure and simple.  ad revenues generated by media covering his death and profits generated by the sale of jackson-related merchandise will keep this mania going for as long as possible. michael jackson was bigger than this world in his thinking. i cannot name any other artist that wrote about unification of humanity and love in the way that he did; he was ahead of his time/our time.  globally  while many fans collectively grieve  i am not sure if as a nation  as a world we will ever get to that place that michael jackson sung and spoke aboutwith passion unmatched.   people were hung up on the things that were fodder for conversation in the absence of  or the shying away from that which we collectively negate as juvenile: love and collective humanity. he loved in ways that we had not seen and that were not socially normed  but is celebrity a social norm?  michael jackson transcended barriers in ways that we have never seen.  he morphed himself into someone who did not look black or white  male or female  so to that degree something in him led him to sacrifice himself on multiple levels to leave a legacy on the world.  he was absolutely someone and many people were somehow internally frustrated by his physical changes because he forbade us from assigning him a label  thus much of the media (and many people) resolved to bullying and name calling in the worst way.  the accusations  the bullying broke a mans spirit and regardless of whether he could be assigned a race  a gender  or a sexual preference; he was in fact human. i  like countless others grieve the loss of a spirit that many people (often the relentless media) would rather crucify than embrace  this is why i grieve. he was unprecedented in his talent  his genius  his work ethic  and his philanthropy.  so i speak on behalf of why i grieve and sure there are things to chat about  wonder about  and questions that should  in respect of his privacy  go unanswered to the public  but in terms of spirit and global presence we grieve the loss of goodness much like we grieved others who have gone before (jackie onassis  princess diana) and countless others who left their global fingerprint on the human spirit. michael jackson will be missed. i  mostly agree with john mcwhorter about him ending up looking like greta garbo. the memorial was heartwrenching to watch. it is impossible to explain the response to michael jacksons death in any logical rational way or even by referencing jackson himself. this kind of unrestrained mania can only be explaind as a human hunger being fulfilled. our need for heroes and someone to believe in. confirmation that live is more than our day to day existence. that there is something more. no matter how good a singer and dancer michael jackson was no entertainer really has the kind of impact on society or on individual lives the response to jacksons death would have us believe jackson did. michael jackson in this context is an actor on a stage in death who allows us to suspend reality in favor of becoming one with a fantasy we are watching and doing our part to create to fantasy. a self-fulfilling prophesy enhanced by the media machine. as such we become fulfilled if only momentarily. no one ccnsumed by michael jackson the last few days will find their lives or society any different a week or month from now because of michael jackson. but you can be forgiven for thinking so right now based on what we see today. part of the mania is nostalgia  remembering a happier  simpler time when michael jackson had his earliest successes. there also has not be any musical artist/dancer/entertainer to emerge in the last 25 years who comes anywhere close to being as talented. sadly he couldnt handle the fame he courted and it killed him as surely as anything else did. the weirder he became  the more he reminded me of norma desmond from billy wilders classic  sunset boulevard  right down to the pet monkey. r.i.p. mj. i think we have wronged mjhe music will live on foreverwe will always be the mediocre people who will hate him because he dared to be different!! he has the potic license to do as he pleasesocienty can never bind genius!! it was his voice. michael jackson was a child that sang his heart out arpegiating up and down with precious melodies. i thought then that he was sweetness itself. this boy was love that could be experienced at listening  then he taught himself taking masters for tutors how to dance and so he danced! that grace that was his own never ceased to attract and hold longer that any other man on earthit was as if he could sign forever by me. i actually chose to dine out only at the place where they carried his sound tracks finding in his voice comfort in the midst of my own troubles. he had me rest  ironically! it was more than art  michael was personal  intimate and so very mine. in very many ways although i am nothing like him i feel there was a love relationship with this tiny man that found so much trouble in the world of the grown ups and for that i held him soi am as hurt and as captive of him as the first time i heard his sweet darling voice. i know what i am about say will make a few of you readers angrydoes america realize that we are making a huge deal over a child molester!! i mean we all know he did it  twice and he had more than enough money to get himself out of it. why else would you have a house called neverland  why invite little kids over to your house when you are the only adult no other children around. sure he had great music but that was before all the alligations. taxpayers are paying 3.5 million for this and i think it just crazy. he died whoopie moving on. rip i am a huge michael jackson  and jackson 5  fan. a single observation among many one could make: perhaps great numbers of us  in michael  saw and connected with two different people: first  the artistic and physical genius we admired and wished we could be  and 2) the lonely  sad  and perhaps abused or neglected person we in fact are. we craved what he had  and we believed he understood and cared about some bruised and lost parts of ourselves. he was both a fantastically gifted and thus remote figure  and an ordinary boy/man who wanted to love and be loved. in life and in death  this powerful combination attracts us. i have been thinking a lot of this situation and i dont know what anyone else thinks  but i personally am anger at his death people fight day and night like farrah for their life and just like elvis i dont think michael death was suppose to happen at 50 years old.  the drugs whether prescription or not was something that could of been kept from happening just like elvis death.  they both should of been able to grow old with their children and families.  i think that is what makes this more sad is it just did not have to be this way for both michael and elvis. i dont know what drives michael mania on the whole; i can only offer a personal perspective.  my michael mania is steeped in gratitude for the example of the potential a solitary life can have. the singing  the dancing  the creating  the teacher  the student  the humanitarian and the celebrity are all apendages to that notion.  each is crucial in defining his singular example  but its the entire package that drives the mania  the bad and the good mixed together.  say what you want about him personally  but the man drove many people to do genuine  sincere and drastic goodeven if the worst assumed about him happened  on that count he deserves respect.i am maniacal for those i sincerely respect. i am curious why the black community imbrace him now when he did everything in his power to be white. he even bought white children. i find that insulting and i am white. i still can;t get over the fact that he is on record saying there is nothing wrong with an adult male sleeping with little boys. did everyone forget that? maybe i would mourn him if he had died before all the surgery and sleepovers. ditto to daves comment.  the media mania is only about the media  specifically money and ratings. the media are unfortunately meeting an apparent insatiable public need to broadcast about michael jackson ad nauseum.  sad at many  many levels. its the music  stupid.  the guy is really really good!  americans dont get it! i spent the last two weeks reading everything i could about michael jackson with the purpose of writing a very poignant and factually accurate account of the incredible life he lived.  if youre a fan of the king of pop  or if youre a fan of good writing  check out my story on the worlds most famous entertainer. //balmer.typepad.com/keithsmooth/ a funny writer  a funny blog he ranted against jewish people and pulled the race card when it fit his purpose. the rest of the time he tried to deny being black  good grief he is whiter than i am as being of irish decent. his children (who are not of his dna) are white. he thought it was ok to sleep with little boys. all of that is forgiven now that he killed himself with drugs? not for a lot of us. i do not more the passing of someone like him. he was a very disturbed person. based on the reaction to his death  there are great many more out there. some of us grieve out of guilt  of our slander  lies and jeering   which acted as a guard against the times when we couldnt comprehend how he had embodied humanity  as we had envisioned  and yet we ourselves seem to stumble in the opposite every time. we all had lost an anchor of love and passion in the sea of violence and hedonism that we swim. its not so much about michael jackson was but what his fans are not.  to me  people who scream and cry and faint over a distant man they would never meet indicates a profound emptiness inside themselves. that millions worship emotionally infirm people like princess diana  elvis and michael jackson is proof to me of a sad  sick society. that today  in a state passing out ious and cutting valuable programs for the needy is a multi million dollar memorial service for a wealthy man that molested children is truly sad. i want to comment on an episode in michael jacksons life that needs to be noted for the record  for posterity.  when the cable music station was created and becane popular across the usa  canada and other countries  blatant racism on the part of the companys executives kept black performers off the channel. all protests were ignored  all sorts of transparent excuses were offered with snickers and jocular put downs. for myself  i personally hated these mtv executives  a small handful  with a boiling raging hatred. had i been an american  i would have found some way to act against them.  it was michael jackson himself acting on his own initiative that ended this racist discrimination by mtv  an organization that was becoming almost indespensible (at that time) in the business of popular music. for this   and the music too of course thank you michael.  and if the heaven that you believe in really does exists  may you rest in peace and joyful tranquility. c. alexander brown whats driving the mania?  thats easythe media.  were told he was the king of pop and he became so.  were told that he was electrifying and he became so.  were told he was a perveted weirdo and he became so. he was a good singer and dancer  but there have been (and will be) lots of others.  i dont miss him at all.  hes no more gone now than he has been for the past several years.  his music and videos will be around forever on the internet.  he has done anything notable (in music  that is) for a long time. well have enough controversy and conspiracy about his death for a long time.  the king of pop is dead?  not really. john  one day youll understand it all. its called

sports,advertisement    david carr     the media equation feb. 12  2012  i was going to tweet about roland martins suspension from cnn  but i decided to write a column about it instead. its safer this way. let me explain. big media companies love when their employees hit twitter. after all  the short-form social media platform gives consumers direct access to media personalities  and along with it  an intimate connection that large media organizations  and the public  revel in. until something goes wrong. roland martin  who is paid to spout opinions on cnn  posted a controversial one on twitter and now he is on suspension. like a lot of us  mr. martin watched the super bowl last sunday and like many of us  he frolicked on twitter as one more way of watching the big game  including commercials. advertisement mr. martin  a syndicated newspaper columnist and a political analyst for cnn  got in trouble for writing  if a dude at your super bowl party is hyped about david beckhams h&m underwear ad  smack the ish out of him! #superbowl. advertisement many  including gay advocacy groups  felt that the post advocated violence against homosexuals. mr. martin  a longtime hater of soccer  saw the immediate blowback on twitter and said he was just mocking that sport  and nothing more. cnn also saw the outcry and suspended mr. martin indefinitely  saying in a news release that his post was regrettable and offensive. this is not the first time someone who makes a living on one platform has been clobbered for making remarks on another. octavia nasr  senior editor for middle eastern affairs at cnn  was fired in 2010 for praising on twitter mohammad hussein fadlallah  a shiite cleric and inspirational figure for hezbollah  after he died. that same year  an arizona daily star reporter was fired for writing posts critical of colleagues and of the city of tucson. the national labor relations boardsaid his dismissal was legal  in part because he had been warned by his employers not to post about work-related issues. markos moulitsas  the founder of the daily kos  was temporarily barred from msnbc after getting in a twitter dispute with joe scarborough on his show morning joe. the list goes on  but you get the idea. the great thing about twitter is it offers a friction-free route to an audience  if it can be thought  it can be posted. thats also the bad thing about twitter. for employees of almost any company  but especially media companies  it creates an ongoing tension: yes  build your personal brand and  by proxy  bring social media luster to your employer  but do it in ways that are consumer-friendly and taste-appropriate. that kind of contemplativeness is not generally a twitter impulse  as mr. martin found out. maybe he had too many nachos as he watched the game  or a few too many adult beverages  but when you are using twitter as companion media to big events  be it the oscars or the super bowl  its hard to resist the urge to say something sassy  transgressive or inappropriate. its been a busy week for the intersection of twitter and mainstream media. the bbcinstructed its reporters to make sure they were breaking news on the bbc and not only on twitter. chris hamilton  the bbcs social media editor  said in a blog post  weve been clear that our first priority remains ensuring that important information reaches bbc colleagues  and thus all our audiences  as quickly as possible  and certainly not after it reaches twitter. sky news  took an even more aggressive twitter stance in an e-mail to its staff last tuesday: it banned the posting of stories from other media outlets  saying  dont tweet when it is not a story to which you have been assigned or a beat which you work. that is a sure-fire way for the twitter accounts of sky news employees to get little traction going forward. advertisement in the current paradigm of media organizations and twitter personalities  good reporters are expected to serve as a kind of wire service for information  and that includes providing links to important stories that they themselves may not have written. there is an expectation that good journalistic posters will be agnostic and even gracious about where information comes from. (rupert murdoch  a prolific twitter user himself and someone who links to media whether he owns it or not  took to twitter to say: i have nothing to do with sky news. well  other than owning a chunk of it  but why split digital hairs?) twitters speed and ease make it the world headquarters of snap judgments. from reading mr. martins post about mr. beckham and another one about a patriots fan dressed all in pink  i saw little evidence per se that what he said was homophobic. so i could have joined the digital debate with something like: hey haters  cool it  let martin be martin. lets move on  people.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. but i didnt  even though i am something of a free speech absolutist  partly because my twitter bio identifies me as someone who writes about media for the new york times. when i do post on twitter  i often look at it through the eyes of my boss and his bosses and ask  is this congruent with the journalistic values of the institution  or  more succinctly  will it create a headache for my employer? in the 15 000 or so tweets and retweets i have written  there are a few id like back and a few that probably made my betters uncomfortable  but mostly ive stayed out of the ditch. the rule at the times is that there is no rule  but there is an expectation  as philip b. corbett  the standards editor for the paper  told me in an e-mail: we expect times journalists to behave like times journalists  and they generally do. a twitter post is not a small news story or a column. it is a thought burped up  generally without consideration. most big media organizations mediate the discourse of their employees because thats the business they are in. more and more  media outlets may be seen as a federation of voices  but there has to be a there there  a single unifying principle or value. and even though i write a column  it has to be based on reporting. a funny thing happens when you report  things get more complicated  and less tweetable. when i thought of writing about mr. martins suspension  i was inclined to believe it was a bone-headed move by a company drunk on correctness. i found some agreement from james poniewozik at time  who said  denounce the remarks  but as ive said before  id rather journalistic outlets  which are in the business of expression and ideas  err on the side of letting people screw up. (he also said that mr. martin  who is fond of wearing ascots  should probably not point a crooked finger at the fashion choices of anyone else.) but i also asked around among my friends  something i would never do as a precursor to tweeting  and got this response from simon dumenco  a longtime media observer and a twitter savant. he wrote in an e-mail: the idea of joking that a dude expressing a positive opinion about a david beckham ad  which was really not about david beckham the soccer star  but david beckham the half-naked sex god  merits a smack-down? thats actually not hilarious to me. its actually scary to me because it reminds me of social situations in my life where ive felt like it would be literally unsafe for people to learn im gay. obviously  what seemed like harmless knuckleheaded banter to me landed very differently with people who generally share my values about free and unfettered discourse. i heard the same thing from other smart people who spend a lot of time on both reporting and twitter. advertisement so while im all for letting the tweets fall where they may  ive come to understand that just because a thought is tapped out on twitter doesnt mean we shouldnt take it seriously. complicated  i know  and just the kind of nuanced conclusion that would never fit into 140 characters. e-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n a version of this article appears in print on february 13  2012  on page b1 of the new york edition with the headline: twitter is all in good fun  until it isnt.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
sports,at ellis island on tuesday morning  the crowd eagerly awaited joe namath. he was a guest of honor at an annual awards ceremony at which his family was being honored for the nobility of its immigrant experience.       but across the hudson  at battery park  the football legend with the million-dollar smile was just another guy in the queue waiting for the ellis island ferry. it was his opportunity to get a small taste of what his hungarian forbears had experienced when they set foot here nearly a century ago: long lines  hard benches and a gaggle of uniformed officers trying to keep things moving.      approaching the metal detector  the jet once known as broadway joe had to empty his pockets: wallet  coins  the sharpie he uses to accommodate autograph seekers. then he removed his super bowl ring from 1969  the upset win against the colts that he famously guaranteed. he laid it in the bin. a security officer handed it back  but did make him take off his belt.     mr. namath reminisced while waiting for the boat about his first impression of new york: a trip with some university of alabama chums to the worlds fair in 1964. to this day  it amazes him that his car was waiting where he had haphazardly left it in manhattan.  that wouldnt happen today  he said.      no ticket  either. maybe they didnt want to bother with out-of-state plates  he mused.     wearing a gold apple in his lapel and accompanied by his daughters  jessica and olivia  he wondered aloud how his grandfather andras nemet and his father  janos  neither of whom spoke english on arrival  had the fortitude for the long journey from the carpathian mountains to the pennsylvania steel town where he was raised. neither made much fuss about what they had endured and just worked hard to assimilate  according to mr. namath.       his paternal grandfather  later known as andy namath  arrived in 1911 aboard the r.m.s. pannonia. but janos was left behind with his grandparents and did not rejoin the family until his mother went back for him in 1920. by that time  the boy was 11. to this day  it just gives more credence to my belief that he came through big-time  mr. namath said of his father.        on the ferry  he ran into candice bergen  the actress who had been asked by the statue of liberty-ellis island foundation to formally announce him and the other winners of family heritage awards  a rarefied circle that included jerry seinfeld  the comedian  and dr. eric r. kandel  the nobel laureate. she also gave gloria and emilio estefan  cuban-born entertainers  a separate award that goes each year to newer arrivals.    i hope i dont get seasick  mr. namath confided to ms. bergen. this is not my kind of boat  really.     hes half-joking  explained his elder daughter  jessica. she noted that her father owns a 24-foot fishing boat named xii in homage to his longtime jersey number. she said he caught his first swordfish this jan. 12  the 40th anniversary of that superbowl win.     he had spent the day catching spanish mackerel  went home for a nap and then went back out at midnight to try his hand at swordfish. to get swordfish   you have to go at night  she explained. its a whole nother thing.  comments are no longer being accepted. broadway joe  we still need heroes. thank you for being you! enem as a native alabamian  not sure why he picked u of a to go to college but i suspect it had a lot to do with the legendary coach bear bryant  when he said will you play for me?  you did and im glad he did  as he did a lot for our state. glad someone did a nice thing for him  broadway joe. bear bryant referred to joe willie namath as the greatest athlete he ever coached.  now  really  what more needs to be said?   i literally grew up idolizing joe willie  he hit bama when i was 11  and my dad and i would eat the golden flake potato chips and coca cola that were the shows sponsors while we watched the bear briyant show every sunday afternoon during football season and listen to the bear growl about how great namath was.  the guaranteed victory over the colts my senior year of high school just topped off what i thought was the career of the man i thought had just unseated johnny unitas as the greatest qb in the nfl.  and you cant imagine what a trip that had to be until you visit beaver falls. namath will always be a hero in this town.by the way in hindsight that super bowl winning jets team had agreat roster and deserved to win super bowl 3 a great story about joes family. living in alabama and a crimson tide supporter i have followed joes career for many years. it was great to learn this about his family. take care joe! one of the greatest things about broadway joe is that he is still an everymandespite his nicknames connotation.  i had the pleasure of meeting joe a couple of years ago.  being a life-long supporter of the crimson tide  i was beside myself with pride and emotion.  yet joe took a few minutes to talk to me  he signed a football i had with me  and shook my hand and wished me well. few of the greats in the nfl would repeat such a performance to a mere fan.  (peyton manning excluded  he was a terrific guy when i met him too.)  i hope joe will also be recognized as an ambassador for the sport and an elder statesman; not simply for his brilliance on the field but for his character off of the field. joe was one of my heroes growing up  bookended by mickey mantle and walt frazier. he is the reason i have been a diehard jets fan for 43 years and counting  despite now having lived  like tequesta  fl resident joe himself  in dolphins territory for a number of those years. joe is the greatest!! new york today is still going strong! though no longer on city room  new york today continues to appear every weekday morning  offering a roundup of news and events for the city. you can find the latest new york today at nytoday.com or in the morning  on the new york times homepage or its new york section. you can also receive it via email. metropolitan diary continues to publish! since 1976  metropolitan diary has been a place for new yorkers  past and present  to share odd fleeting moments in the city. we will continue to publish one item each weekday morning and a round-up in monday's print edition.  you can find the latest entries at nytimes.com/diary and on our new york section online.  city room  a news blog of live reporting  features and reader conversations about new york city  has been archived. send questions or suggestions  by e-mail.  advertisement 
sports,amid the flow of super tuesdays  superbowl surprises  news about faltering energy projects and rising solar cities  ive been collecting threads that relate to a central theme of dot earth: the implications of humanitys growing numbers and resource thirst. here are a few from the last few days: -a radio commentary quoting one of the less-familiar dictums of adam smith  who is best known for championing economic growth  but in this case was warning about too much of a good thing. -the hypnotically unnerving documentary manufactured landscapes  which glaringly displays the increasingly human-shaped face of earth. -a sociology paper proposing that the best way to lessen consumption for its own sake is to reduce how much people work. (is there a win-win here  or am i missing something?) -a paper in the journal science on sustainability showing that  by one measure  afflictions related to affluence take away as many years of life as do ills associated with poverty. these papers and observations all circle around the two questions at the heart of the sustainability puzzle that will largely determine the quality of human lives and the environment in which they are lived: how many? how much?  how many people will inhabit earth in the next few generations?  how much stuff  energy  land  water  marine life  will they consume? a few examples: the overlay of rising demand and lagging supply of oil or comparable liquid fuel will shape everything from economics to international conflict. the amount of coal extracted and burned (along with the oil) will influence climate for centuries to come. the extent of land used to grow fuel  food  or fiber will determine the costs of those necessities and also the fate of the worlds last untrammeled ecosystems. back to the related nuggets above. i was listening to the public-radio program marketplace and heard a guest commentary by charles handy  an expert on business management who founded the london business school and is in residence at the drucker school of business of claremont (calif.) graduate university. he was musing on the ideas of two departed pillars of economics  adam smith and peter drucker  in relation to limits to growth. an excerpt:   i wonder how [peter drucker] would have reacted to some of the things that bother me. for instance  how would he respond to what i call adam smiths great conundrum? adam smith  the father of economics  250 years ago  said: an investment is by all right-minded people to be commended  because it brings comforts and necessities to the citizenry. but  if continued indefinitely  it will lead to the endless pursuit of unnecessary things. now that i am living for a while in california  i am staggered by the amount of unnecessary things that i see in the malls that dot the suburbs. america is no different from anywhere else  of course  just more so. the conundrum is this: all that stuff creates jobs  making it  promoting it  selling it. its literally the stuff of growth. what id love to ask peter drucker is: how do you grow an economy without the jobs and taxes that these unnecessary things produce? drucker saw business as the agent of progress. its main responsibility  he said  was to come up with new ideas and take them to market. but not just any new ideas  please  only those that bring genuine benefits to the customers  and do not muck up the environment. the market  unfortunately  does not differentiate between good and bad. if the people want junk  the market will provide. so we have to fall back on the conscience of our business leaders.  then there was manufactured landscapes  a film examining how human demands for resources and products are transforming the physical world  and the environment experienced on a daily basis by humans caught up in the rush of urbanized  mechanized  work-centered life. it does so over the shoulder of the canadian photographer edward burtynsky  who has made chronicling the face of the anthropocene epoch his lifes work of late. i saw a snippet of it when writing a post on the urban age last week  but finally had a chance to watch the dvd. it is an unforgettable experience  something like a mash-up of  apocalypse now and modern times. it is a sobering view  particularly the scenes in sprawling chinese factory cities churning out the (unnecessary?) things that prosperous people seem to need in ever-rising amounts. watch the hands of a young woman as she speeds through the 20 or so manipulations necessary to make an electronic device whose purpose she only can guess at. she makes 400 a day. then watch as the camera pans cavernous halls full of similar workers  then cuts outdoors to the cordons of thousands of workers heading to yellow dormitories.  how many factories? how much stuff? then came sustainable consumption and worktime reduction  a paper by juliet schor  a sociologist at boston college  that i stumbled on while surfing a 2005 special issue of the journal industrial ecology on the global impacts of cities. the entire issue is enlightening.  she chronicles how industrialized economies have generally translated productivity gains in the workplace into making more stuff (and money to buy stuff) instead of making less work (reducing work hours).  a world heading toward 9 billion  however  following that path of ever more work and money to buy ever more stuff  cannot be sustained  professor schor concludes:  achieving a sustainable and equitable global solution is clearly incompatible with a worldwide replication of u.s. lifestyles or even the somewhat less damaging ecological impacts of the lifestyles of other industrialized countries. in such a situation  inhabitants of the global north can and should opt for a new economic and social vision based on quality of life  rather than quantity of stuff  with reduced work time and ecological sustainability at its core. such a vision has the potential to create broad-based pressure for an alternative to the current system of ecologically destructive  inequitable consumer-driven growth. indeed  the future of the planet increasingly depends on it. this paper echoed ideas i explored in 2005  when writing on bhutans experiment with gross national happiness as a substitute for the more familiar gross national product.  finally  there was science and technology for sustainable well-being  a paper in science by john p. holdren  the harvard expert on energy  environment  development and lots of other things.  the paper is a sprawling portrait of a world poised between a livable path toward 9 billion and one wracked by disruption and suffering  along with a menu for limiting losses as we head into crunch time these next few decades. but one chart really grabbed my attention. by dr. holdrens analysis  when you measure human tolls in years of life lost (e.g.  a child cut down by disease loses decades; a grandmother dying of a stroke at 80 loses a few years.)  the major afflictions of poverty and affluence do us in at roughly equal rates.  childhood and maternal malnutrition  he estimates  erased 200 million life years in the year 2000. high blood pressure  cholesterol  obesity  and lack of physical activity erased 150 million life years. (theres a long list of other causes  from war to tobacco.) so at each end of the development ladder  from not enough to too much  we get into trouble.  so are we now locked into the endless pursuit of unnecessary things? in thinking about this warning from adam smith  i cant help but feel bad for thomas malthus  who has taken all the heat from free-market champions of eternal growth over the years.  maybe it was adam smith who was the first malthusian prophet of doom. comments are no longer being accepted. what about all these e-mails you yourself are collecting? one does expect a founder of the social science of economics to appreciate the ultimate implications of the law of dimunition at the margin. im not sure the goal of reducing the amount of output is as desirable (even with the prospect of less work!) as it sounds.  perhaps the better approach is instead of slowing people down we attempt to influence the perception of what success means. if you understand what is learned in the book  the millionaire next door  youll see that successful (and often happier) people produce a lot more than they consume.  on the contrary  people who suffer in this economy tend to be at the other end  consuming more than they produce.  often they do this in some attempt to keep up with their peers  while what seems to be happening is an arms race of consumption by folks completely unprepared to pay the cost of the race. perhaps re-applying stigma to financial failure  something that the bankruptcy-mill law firms have been working to remove (its not your fault!  call us and well get you out of debt!) would be valuable  especially if taught in school. nobody is entitled to an ipod or a wii or a 50 inch plasma tv or bling or even a car until theyve achieved the wherewithall to actually pay for it.  and generally  once youve actually accumulated the money necessary to afford such things  you start to value other things more than the ostentatious display. heres the new message.  it is your fault.  if you cant afford it  put it back.  if you dont make enough  either work harder or get more training/education.  carrying revolving debt consisting of past burrito purchases is dumb. it really is easier to spend debt than to spend savings.  perhaps a refocusing on financial education would help solve this problem of excessive consumption. and youd be surprised  when people are relieved of the psychological load of excessive consumer debt and the demand to keep up  they will (imho) look more carefully at resource consumption on a larger scale.  because theyll notice their friends who have a designer purse full of maxed out credit cards and be repulsed by the idea. when the government can no longer tax us to pay for the drugs to treat hypertension  obesity  diabetes and atherosclerosis  it will tell us to work for food  and the problem will resolve itself. =================== jeez  andy  get with the program: the american way of life is non-negotiable. thats george bush is comment on the rio earth summit. an attitude that probably began with herbert hoovers campaign promise of a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage. our political culture cannot handle talk of the endless pursuit of unnecessary things  unfortunately. doesnt poll well. there are exceptions  like the late senator gaylord nelson who said (borrowing from herman daley?) the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. thank you andrew for asking these questions. i have been posing this scenario to any who will listen: we can also reduce our co2 emmissions by reducing consumption. for instance  junk mail. certainly few would oppose putting a stop to junk mail. post office will need fewer employees  mail trucks will drive fewer miles  the mail trucks will need new tires less often and less maintenance.a few mechanics will lose their jobs  a lumber jack and trucker lose their jobs  somewhere a paper mill will close and a printing press will go quite. you might imagine all the other workers and families that are affected. we have burned less fossil fuel  reduced our carbon emmissions  cut fewer forests and no more junk mail  all good things. but thousands of people lose their jobs. i look forward to hearing what your readers have to say on this subject. chris  imagine all the things we can how much longer can the earth be reasonably and sensibly expected to sustain the colossal  unbridled growth of human consumption  production and propagation activities now overspreading the surface of our planetary home?  the current scale and unlimited growth of human population numbers worldwide as well as of the seemingly endless production and unrestrained human consumption of unnecessary things on a planet with the relatively small size and makeup of earth inevitably becomes unsustainable at some point in space-time  does it not? whatsoever is is  is it not? thomas malthus was not considering the side-effect of excessive food in the environment leading to obesity. powerful and advanced machinery combined to food industry technology can produce food in all shapes  tastes  colors  and preferences to hunt man at any niche of his existence. fresh fruits contain around 70% water while biscuits contain just 10%. fruits satiate faster and with more appropriate nutrition delivering less digestible nutrients and more balanced vitamins and minerals. food in the chain is not only excessive but also highly processed and inappropriate to feed humans to a healthy lifestyle. processed food also are more digestible for receiving mechanical  and thermal treatment  and additives to chance color  taste  texture  and flavor.  human appetite was designed wildly to gulp on plenty times and store fat to cope common shortages that presently was razed from our modern environment. nowadays it becomes even difficult to sociologists to address such complexity in modern life when nutrition and physiology play a strong factor within the food chain and agricultural systems. malthus was not taking into account also that all sorts of machinery expanding the power of human muscle work to change deeply the environment would help to mold a new modern man sedentary and flaccid hurting the physiological functioning. it is predicted by the increasing obesity trend that by 2050 half of the population will be obese. obesity brings general side-effects to human life like diabetes  apnea  organs failure  and less reproductive power.  i believe that modern man will not reach 9 billions before start crumbling to its own failure to achieve a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. the truth is that we are hurting ourselves in the same way that we are spoiling the environment. the solution for a balanced lifestyle is easy to discuss and confirm  but very hard to achieve on a broad scale of human affairs. eating plenty of fruits and vegetables as well as keep a body fit with any sort of body activity. the world changed a lot recently on our power to know and understand. i am posting this opinion now. everyday i can get fresh news around the world since i have a news alert at google sending me links of anything in the internet that mention the word obesity. i know about obesity going on in new zealand  japan  australia  england  denmark  africa  china  hawaii  etc. malthus was not aware on what the food industry could do to change human feeding habits. he did not see much about the power of food marketed in plastic packaging and tv ads. slowly we are learning about the side-effects of excessive food  alcohol  drugs  smoking  and sedentarism. people doing body fitness are having a healthier life  more calcium in their bones  less stress on their routine  more neurons in their hippocampus for more memory and cognitive senses. body fitness improves sexual performance and capacity to work harder or have more adventure in their lives for standing higher body demand.  people caring for their health drink less alcohol  avoid drugs or smoking keeping their body fit should be ready to cope other stress in the surviving struggle we are facing in the course of modern life. the system is very tricky with flaws to endorse the economic system. milk is the product that nature designed to feed new born mammals not necessary after we are weaned. milk is good for the economy and not necessarily for human health. so  we can understand the underlying reasoning behind government guidelines for nutrition and many other things  promote the economy. indeed we are made to believe that we need something when in fact that requirement is more for an economic growth than a real benefit.  actually we have to be very careful on our real need supporting the economy that is also profiting from our disgrace.  the economic system makes money selling excessive food  selling diet pills  selling baric surgeries. money goes around and comes around fattening us  and making us shedding weight; selling machinery to replace our mechanical work and selling machine to make us get fit. a healthier lifestyle is a personal decision to adopt many shortcuts that slow down the economy profiting on our blatant collapse. not everything is bad and not everything is good  but a wise decision to accept or adopt only those ones that can keep human lives in balance with the fundamentals of our existence is the keystone. down the line we are understanding how much modern life is tricking and spoiling our fragile existence. what we really need is a new way of looking at life itself  or  rather  a new way of living it.  as edward abbey  pointed out two decades ago  it should be clear to everyone by now that crude numerical growth does not solve our chronic problems of unemployment  welfare  crime  traffic  filth  noise  squalor  the pollution of our air  the corruption of our politics  the debasement of the school system (hardly worthy of the name education)  and the general loss of popular control over the political processwhere money  not people  is now the determining factor.  though this was written two decades ago  the elections of 2008 in the united states would have stunned abbey with their gross extravagance.  he would not  however  have been surprised at all by vice-president al gores comment that over and over again  wealth and power have become concentrated in the hands of a few who consolidate and perpetuate their control at the expense of the many.   john saul put a finger on one major problem when he noted that the central perception of globalization [which affects us all today] is that civilization should be seen through economics  and economics alone.   there are cheerleaders for globalization.  for example  thomas friedman wrote that . . . what the flattening of the world [his view of technology and globalization] means is that we are now connecting all the knowledge centers on the planet together into a single global network  whichif politics and terrorism dont get in the waycould usher in an amazing era of prosperity and innovation.  though billions of people live outside those knowledge centers friedman even cites bill gatess comment that natural talent has started to trump geography.  im not so sure about that  though i do agree with brett wallach that so far globalization probably has had more benefits than costs and that were in this globalization to our eyeballs  and were in it together  regardless of our passports and bank books.  im less convinced that wallach is correct when he asserts that . . . globalization goes far beyond products  companies  and jobs.  it goes to the way people think.  it creates a global civilization with a single shared  sustaining ideology.  if that ideology is driven by a belief in sustained economic growth  then i do not agree.  rather  i am closer to john saul  who suggests that it may be that we are now not only at the end of the globalist period but also at the end of the western rationalist period and its obsessions with clear linear structures on every subject.   defense of the rationalist period can be found among virtually all economists  but it has led us now to a paradox.  on the one hand our material wealth has grown beyond belief  but on the other hand we are increasingly aware of the vast damage that we have done to earths ecosystems.  we are ambivalent about our success. steven levitt and stephen dubner wrote that morality  it could be argued  represents the way that people would like the world to workwhereas economics represents how it actually does work.  economics is above all a science of measurement.  but not everything of value can be reduced to numbers and formulas  as pascal was well aware.  for example  adam gopnik pointed out that numbers and honesty and transparency only get you so far in the world.  our experiences of everything are too mediatedby contexts and intentions and likenessto be summed up in a number.   just as our population cannot grow forever  our lives require more for satisfaction than endless shelves of cheap goods at wal-mart.  as edward abbey noted  growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.  the world as it is in 2008 is simply not sustainable  despite what economists argue.  sustainable growth is an oxymoron  as we will almost assuredly find out during the current century.   whether abbey or saul are right or not  it is clear that we live in a time when individual hedge fund managers on wall street are making over a billion dollars a year while most people in the poorest countries are surviving on less than one or two dollars a day.  as immanuel wallerstein  wrote  we live in an imperfect world  one that will always be imperfect and therefore always harbor injustice.  but we are far from helpless before this reality.  we can make the world less unjust; we can make it more beautiful; we can increase our cognition of it.  finally  as edward abbey  put it  a world entirely conquered by technology  entirely dominated by industrial processes  entirely occupied by man and machine  would be a world unfit to live in. as andy suggests with adam smith  and as ive suggested with other classical economists such as malthus  david ricardo  and john stuart mill  these folks had wide-ranging minds and saw the world in very different and more complex terms than do modern economists.  today our world view is dominated by the calculus of neoclassical economics  and underlying that view is the notion that growth is always a desirable goal and that resources are infinite.  that defies both common sense and ecological reality. people are part of the problem  as are some of our uses of technology  globalization in its present state  and our endless assault on the environment.  the following quote is from john stuart mills principles of political economy (1848)  a time when the population of the world had just topped its first billion and there were about 23 million people living in the united states: it is scarcely necessary to remark that a stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement.  there would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture  and moral and social progress; as much room for improving the art of living  and much more likelihood of its being improved  when minds ceased to be engrossed by the art of getting on.  even the industrial arts might be as earnestly and as successfully cultivated  with this sole difference  that instead of serving no purpose but the increase of wealth  industrial improvements would produce their legitimate effect  that of abridging labour. . . . only when  in addition to just institutions  the increase of mankind shall be under the deliberate guidance of judicious foresight  can the conquests made from the powers of nature by the intellect and energy of scientific discoverers  become the common property of the species  and the means of improving and elevating the universal lot. let me end with a few final observations that scientists and others have made about population  quality of life  and the environment.  mark bush  an ecologist  noted that the human population is  therefore  the root cause of most environmental problems  and the sheer number of humans plays a very significant role in degrading the environment.  writing about the industrial revolution  joel kotkin commented that this new industrial society may have been creating unprecedented wealth  but at the cost of every basic human value.  bruce babbitt echoed similar thoughts  stating that development should enlarge the possibilities for human progress  creativity  and quality of life  which it cannot accomplish by continually eroding the beauty and productivity of the natural world.  according to jared diamond our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course. . . thus  because we are rapidly advancing along this non-sustainable course  the worlds environmental problems will get resolved  in one way or another  within the lifetimes of the children and young adults alive today.  whether that resolution is pleasant or not will depend on choices that we are making today  and must be making in the years ahead.  jack weatherford went so far as to suggest that whether we take an optimistic view or a pessimistic one  it seems clear that we stand now at the conclusion of a great age of human history.  this ten-thousand-year episode seems to be coming to an end  winding down.  lester brown  wrote that if we cannot stabilize population and if we cannot stabilize climate  there is not an ecosystem on earth we can save.  richard heinberg  warned us that overpopulation is currently one of humanitys greatest problems  and it will become a far greater one with the gradual disappearance of fossil energy resources.  pimentel and wilson  pointed out that as the world population continues to expand  all vital natural resources will have to be divided among increasing numbers of people and per-capita availability will decline to low levels.  when this occurs  we believe that it will become quite difficult to maintain prosperity  a quality life  and even personal freedoms for those who already enjoy them  much less secure those benefits for the billions currently living without.

(and so beat out my colleague norman myers by over two centuries.) adam smith considered the subsidies to the scottish herring industry in his 1776 book the wealth of nations.  he called them bounties. herrings were an important part of the food of the common people.  subsidized herrings might  he hypothesized  contribute to the relief of a great number of our fellow-subjects  whose circumstances are by no means affluent.  he rejected this hypothesis by concluding that the legislature has been very grossly imposed upon in paying bounties. bounties had the effect of encouraging rash undertakers to adventure in a business they do not understand  knowing that the government would bail them out if they failed.

at its core.  its likely few people appreciate the value of promoting and protecting a less that 40-hour work week. trinifar yes  the major issue of our times  particularly for americans  how do you remove society from production as work and consumption as reward hamster wheel when it is the dominant culture paradigm. it has created its own church and priesthood that defines and thus controls reality to as great as an extent as the church did in medieval europe. just look at how al gore  silicon valley  and some of the top enviro groups are defining the solutions to global warming as a major economic opportunity. finally  as the american economy enters a recession  we will watch a very narrow debate between keynesian demand or supply-side stimulus  two sides of the same coin. peace joe andrew and commenters  welcome to the party. now this conversation is getting serious and to the point. those interested in this topic might want to take a look at john feeneys site: growth is madness  at: //growthmadness.org/ hes been engaged in a responsible discussion of this topic for quite a while. we are  indeed  on the threshold of comprehending that the classical view of economics is dead wrong in many regards. evolutionary and ecological economics show the human-built world to be every bit as much a part of the ecos as any wild landscape. the only difference is that man has a penchant for turning raw materials and energy into non-contributing stuff. its a one-way process  whereas the rest of nature works on material cycles and natural (read solar  tidal  and geothermal) energy flows. we cheated by dipping into the bank of fossil energy stores with abandon. poor judgments about what is important in life  at what rate should we proceed to develop  what is our natural balance with the rest of nature  and so forth have dominated our history. i have been concerned about this abandon for years. my own interest is in the phenomenon of wisdom  or rather the lack thereof  in human decision-making. as a species we seem to not really have a long-term  wide-angle  reality-based  and love-motivated view of the world (a terse definition of wisdom). yet todays complex  interrelated world requires global-scale wisdom and judgment. i fail to see this in any of the crop of leaders and wannabe leaders today unfortunately. but i am encouraged to see these kinds of conversations emerging from the crowd.  the coupled issues of over-consumption and population are critical factors in all of the global issues we have been discussing. they are proximal causes of the degradation of the world. but they are also  themselves  caused by the evolutionarily determined behavioral psychology of homo sapiens. people do these things and are married to these ideas because there is a deep wiring of the brain that once benefited humans but now seems to lead to non-sustainable and selective disadvantaged behavior en masse.  there is  however  a way out. we are not slaves to ancient genetic endowment. the prefrontal cortex provides humans with a capacity to override behaviors and tendencies based on a grander understanding of the situation. the problem we face  as a species  is that the prefrontal development is relatively stunted compared with our needs in a globalized  complex world. wisdom comes from an ability to think far ahead in time with comprehensive models of how the world works. the latter comes from the capacity (natural) to think and learn systemically. it derives from a motivation to love and integrate with all of nature. humans  on average  have some capacity for this kind of mentation. but it was just emerging in the late pleistocene when the development of intelligence and creativity seems to have overtaken the growth of wisdom and led to our drive for invention and domination over the natural world (agriculture and artifacts). if and when future human evolution produces greater prefrontal capacity we will see a shift in human behavior away from self-  family-  and tribal-centered and selfish  near-term judgment to much more inclusive  caring and sharing behavior. our judgments will be more comprehensive and oriented toward a more universal good. the development toward that end is already visible in the past evolution of our species. there is a trajectory found in the development of altruistic and cooperative social behaviors over the course of hominid evolution. follow the trajectory. and note that there are a few examples of this kind of mind among us today. unfortunately  that evolution may proceed through another bottleneck. it may be that a significant collapse of the current population will restrict the survival of the qualities of prefrontal capacity needed for wisdom. given our current course of actions (and failures to understand and act in timely fashion) one could easily project such a scenario. however  i would like to believe that if conversations such as this can find some purchase in our current less-than-optimal state of wisdom  we will use our significant cleverness (combined intelligence and creativity) to find humane ways to ease the population down to some sustainable level while evolution does its thing. i realize this is a giant leap for most reading this. i have a tendency to think way outside the box. definitely  i question the conventional wisdom! george //www.questioneverything.typepad.com/ ps. at my academic website you can find a bibliography of evolutionary behavioral research and wisdom research. //faculty.washington.edu/gmobus/research.html consider what happens to deer on an island with no natural predators to keep their population in check i was going to write a long response to this  but really  my sentiments have been echoed by many other posters and i wont take up more space. i just urge everyone to take a look at this video: //www.thestoryofstuff.com its a really amazing 20 minute walk-through of how we got to be the consumer society we are  a look at the actual processes of production  distribution  consumption  and disposal  and thoughts on how we can change. thanks as always for the stimulating posts  mr. revkin. yes  in agreement with above  a great post. one of the consequences of the milton friedman dream of stripping the government out of the free market is that one ends up being governed by consumers  rather than citizens. bravo  andy. thank you for this article. id like to quote  roderick frazier nash  professor emeritus of history and environmental studies at uc california  santa barbara. this is a perfect place to insert an excerpt of an essay he wrote in 1996 in plateau journal. i picked it up after id hiked out of the grand canyons phantom ranch  where i was humbled in a way i never knew possible. talk about a miniscule nothing? looking at the geological history in a place like that canyon should shake everyone into acting on behalf of saving whats left of this wild planet. though how  as you so eloquently chronicle above in terms of economics  remains the bigger question. i think my life is bad sometimes. jesus  those people in that assembly line photo above..god help them. as a result of our sheer numbers (5.8 billion and counting at the rate of 10 000 new human lives each hour)  our unprecedented technological power  and our lack of an ethic that embraces the environment  we are no longer thinking or acting like a part of nature. or  if we are a part  it is a cancerous one  growing so rapidly as to endanger the larger whole. our species  in a word  is a terrible neighbor to the 30 million or so other species that share this planet. right now we desperately need a time out to learn how to be team players; we need to learn how to live responsibly in the larger community called the ecosystem. what wilderness provides is precisely this time out. its presence reminds us of just how far we have separated from the rest of nature. in wild places we stand naked of the civilized habitat our technology has created  open to seeing ourselves once again as large mammals totally dependent on the health of our environment. we learn gratitude  humility  and dependency. we are reminded of the old ways that nourished us both ecologically and psychologically for so long. thoreau was more correct than he knew about the critical importance of wildness and wilderness to the preservation of the world. the human being is inextricably linked to the health  diversity and normal functioning of the global ecosystem.  i hope julia butterfly proves right: no matter how far down the wrong road we go  we can always turn around and go back to the right road. that right road being to just stop for gods sake  and regroup toward less of everything. elizabeth tjader itd be nice if all these gadgets were repairable. now  they are sealed shut  even with batteries  and we cant get them fixed. we have to buy whole new units. talk about wasteful. by asking about the sustainability of our collective future in terms of how many people and how much will they consume  i hear  four horsemen in hair shirts clattering toward us to save the planet!   but when they arrive  will americans  chinese and everyone else mend their too many and too much ways in the face of war  famine and disease?  fear and want rarely bring out the best in us and dire conditions can turn anyone into an immigrant or a case of population excess.  perhaps this hair shirt foursome will make us profligates mend our ways and emulate the environmentally virtuous  but dont count on it. today  sustainability and climate arent make the cut of top issues in the us presidential race.  the fact is that by casting these critical issues as a matter of consumer choice and lifestyle is deeply apolitical and it means that they wont make the cut.  but its not too late to find the public and collective aspects of a path toward sustainability  but we have to start by asking the right questions.  [andy revkin belatedly says: you stopped too soon. what are the right questions?] em  given the success of some efforts to recycle unused stuff (and prevent the creation of more) such as craigslist  freecycle etc  perhaps it would make sense for some of the green-minded and technologically gifted among us to create gadget recycling services  where theyd accept items deemed unusable  harvest usable parts and recycle the rest. with some effort  they might even be able to identify common design and manufacturing flaws that lead generally cheap (too cheap to repair) items breaking down and becoming the refuse we arent able to deal with.  they could put that sort of information into the public sphere and 1)influence purchasing decisions  2) shame designers and manufacturers into improving their output  3) create a parts inventory for people who would like to fix an item rather than throw it away. they might even shame designers into making items repairable.  many small gadgets have to be broken to get to the innerts.  if that werent the case  repair would be more common. sustainability  morality (in a broad sense)  the media  the big elephant  and etc. as i have posted before on dot earth  perhaps ten times now  i believe that it can be shown (based on the latest science and on sound reasoning closely attached to that science) that: morality itself (in the broad scientific-philosophical sense of the term) is most foundationally about the sustainable and healthy survival of the human species along with plentiful biological diversity along with the sustainable health of our home  planet earth  all accomplished in a way that respects human equality (in important senses) and embraces a living and somewhat fragile planet. i post this here  again  because several people on this thread make very good points that preview  or point to  or underscore  certain key elements of this broader picture. the recent google announcement also points to and illustrates this notion  just as one example.  the movie children of men illustrates  in part  the central theme.  and so forth.   shifting subjects (although all of these subjects are interrelated  of course): there is  of course  a problem that needs to be acknowledged  faced  and addressed  which is this:  although we humans do have an issue and (in some cases) habit of over-consumption  the media themselves get their lifeblood (in other words  revenues) in large part from advertisers  who provide those revenues because the ads help sell us more stuff  much of which we dont need.  this fundamental point is still the big elephant on the table in the room  culturally speaking.  the media would rather discuss anything but this point.  they cant  of course  explain precisely why this point should not be discussed or addressed  at least not rationally.  instead  they just assume it away or hope that it goes away.  but it wont  this time around  especially as problems (and considerations) of the (lack of) sustainability become increasingly more obvious and harmful  to more and more people.   in a sense  there seems to be a competition of sorts to see who can remain in greater denial for the longer period of time  on different (but both vastly important) issues:  the media  or the coal industry?  of course  there are at least one or two other major segments of the economy in this competition as well.         the situation has already gone past the point of being orwellian  in my view  when media outlets discuss over-consumption even as most of the paper is devoted to ad space. earlier today  i visited the area on the times website devoted to the candidates views on global warming.  i visited the area at least three times  perhaps four or five  while i was trying to read about the candidates specific views regarding coal.  each time i visited  an online color ad appeared  on the climate change page of the times site  and it was a chevron ad. although i dont necessarily agree with him on every single matter (but i do on several key matters)  if i remember correctly  al gore raises concerns about the relationship between media (and news) and money in his great book  the assault on reason.  many other people have also pointed out the problem  of course.  but  the media seem to ignore the problem  and it just gets worse  and we seem to let it pass.   so  ill end with three great quotes:   anyone who wants a certain result  but is quite happy with the absence of what would bring it about  has obviously no understanding of either causes or effects.  petrarch the significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.  albert einstein facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.  aldous huxley i hope this post is helpful in some way.  sorry to shout so loudly  but it seems that whispering on this issue does not get anywhere with the media. re:  comment #15 dear mr. mobus  in large part  our behavior is motivated by instinct. if we did not have the instinct to desire to have things  then how would we have survived as a species in the first place?   advertising manipulates this instinct  causing us to believe that things will give us satisfaction and pleasure  even if they are completely unnecessary. furthermore  in recent times  the culture of the u.s. has been transformed by television. it must be clear to one and all that human beings are nearly addicted to this form of visual stimulation.  our mass culture is now very much driven by what we see on television. television is all business. if we  as a people  are to turn in another direction that is away from consumption of the many needless goods offered to us  how shall we accomplish this? i think that the answer  for our culture at any rate  must lie with business and consumers working together. for all of us  there must be an increased awareness of the consequences of our consumption/production. we must be taught to waste not  want not  and to like it. andrew  this following little adverbial phrase of yours: glaringly displays the increasingly human-shaped face of earth  is a tiny window into your mind  an innocently written phrase that suddenly makes your otherwise hidden nihilism *glaringly* clear.   maybe you should think about the role of inchoate *human-hatred* in all this discourse about climate change.   as far as im concerned  climate change is another way to speak about original sin.  like the dogmatic religious thought it so bizarrely and unwittingly mimics  thought about climate change is a way of *hating human beings* for their complex and aggressive nature. think hard about these points.

sports,sunday puzzle  there is nothing more important than looking after your health  and finn vigeland is back today to remind us to see our doctors. if you look carefully  youll find plenty of them in todays crossword. thank goodness for those sunday puzzle titles. you read them  dont you? if youre just joining us  the sunday crossword is the only one in the new york times that runs with a title and its a leg up to the theme  if you need one. mr. vigeland has added the letters dr (the abbreviation for doctor) to a set of common phrases and then clued them in a wacky way. some of these work better for me than others  and i noticed that the ones that seemed stretchy to me were the ones that the 113a revealer  the doctor is in  matched most closely  which were the theme entries that had dr on the inside. for example  it took me a while to parse do dr. no harm (from the phrase do no harm) and baby dr. ruth (from the candy bar baby ruth). anyway  here is the full theme set: 23a: dr. pepper spray (dr. pepper soda + pepper spray) 34a: baby dr. ruth (baby ruth candy bars + dr. ruth westheimer) 48a: dr. whos your daddy (dr. who* + whos your daddy?) 64a: dr. j crew (basketballs dr. j + clothing catalog j. crew) 85a: the wizard of dr. oz (dr. [mehmet] oz + the wizard of oz) 98a; do dr. no harm (the phrase do no harm + dr. no)  *side note for my fellow bbc doctor who nerds: yes  the show is actually called doctor who with the dr. spelled out. please re-holster your sonic screwdrivers and lets move on. some great nontheme fill here today. i particularly liked team u.s.a.  at signs  may i see  slays (used in a fairly modern sense)  super bowl m.v.p.  mt. pocono  hug it out  presses on  jdate and jlaw  seth rogen and san francisco   i thought that mr. vigelands cluing was fair and that there werent too many really twisty clues  but some of them go back pretty far. in order to help our younger solvers  lets introduce a few people who pop up in crosswords that solvers should get to know:  herbert lom was probably best known in the united states for playing chief inspector dreyfus in the pink panther films starring peter sellers  and he was hilarious. primarily known in that role for his nervous laugh and eventual twitch as inspector clouseau inadvertently drove him insane.  peggy lee was a jazz and pop music singer and whether or not you know it  you know who she is. have you ever watched the disney movie lady and the tramp? she voiced the role of peg  and sang that vampy number  hes a tramp:  dr. j is the nickname of the great julius erving.  dr. ruth westheimer is an american sex therapist and media personality who became a cultural icon of sorts in the 1980s for her frank and enthusiastic talk on television  her petiteness and a german accent that seemed incredibly appropriate for a psychologist. ironically  dr. ruth released a book with the same title as todays revealer.  dr. no was a james bond villain who was the main antagonist in the 1957 novel and 1962 film of the same name. he was the one of the inspirations for mike myerss character dr. evil in the austin powers films.  janet weiss is one half of the couple that winds up at dr. frank n. furters  castle during the 1975 cult film rocky horror picture show. she was played by susan sarandon. if youve never seen it  check this out and then go watch the rest of the film.   yasir arafat was  the leader of the palestinian liberation organization  president of the palestinian national authority and a founder of the fatah paramilitary group. lets hear from mr. vigeland: this is my first add-a-letter-and-create-a-wacky-phrase puzzle in the times  and my 10th new york times puzzle overall. considering my penchant for puns  im surprised it took this long! dr whos your daddy is definitely my favorite themer. (dr whos on first was another contender for the dr. who entry  but this one fit better  and made me laugh more.) sundays can be a slog to solve sometimes  but they are certainly a lot of fun to construct given the larger canvas to play with. i really enjoyed fitting in entries like superbowl mvp (so many consonants!)  seth rogen  san francisco  frat bros  hug it out and oh boo hoo  as well as introducing shorter stuff like jdate and jlaw (and who doesnt love those js?). im pleased that will and joel kept probably 90 percent of my clues. ive always preferred gridwork to cluing  so its a nice affirmation to see that im getting more on track with variety  difficulty and length of clues. everyone feeling better now? good! on to the monday puzzle we go. but first  your thoughts? welcome to our conversation about word games. here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the variety puzzle. along with discussion about the day's challenge  you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from the times's puzzlemaster  will shortz. deb amlen is a humorist and puzzle constructor whose work has appeared in the new york times  the washington post  the los angeles times  the onion and bust magazine. her books  it's not p.m.s.  it's you and create your life lists are available where all fine literature is sold.  numberplay is a puzzle suite that will be presented in wordplay every monday. the puzzles  which are inspired by many sources and are reported by gary antonick  are generally mathematical or logical problems  with occasional forays into physics and other branches of science. while written for adults  many of the concepts here are suitable for and can be enjoyed by math students of all ages.  gary antonick  who has created or edited over 100 logic and math puzzles for the new york times  secretly believes every math problem can be solved using circles and straight lines. he is a visiting scholar at stanford university  where he studies mathematical problem solving.     the new york times weekly puzzle blog numberplay has moved to a new and improved location. come check it out!readmore     try these olympics-themed puzzles from po-shen loh  team lead for team u.s.a  winner of this years international mathematical olympiad. also  if you could train with the best  would you? perspectives from olympians gwen jorgensen andclark burckle. readmore     activate your olympic spirit with a challenge from the rio resident and mathematician marco moriconi.readmore     kurt mengel and jan-michele gianette help us get organized.readmore     ruth margolin returns with a puzzle thats double the fun.readmore follow advertisement

sports,advertisement by elissa gootmanoct. 7  2011  if most jobs in television are not as fabulous in real life as they seem from the battered couches of the people watching at home  the job of ny1 early-morning traffic reporter has a particularly high grunge-to-glamour imbalance: youre on the air at 5 a.m. your job is to tell viewers when the 2/3 trains are running local south of 34th street and just how backed up the bqe is  in exactly 60 seconds. but there is jamie shupak  on the new york observers list of 50 media power bachelorettes. there she is in a fashion spread in the new york post  holding onto a subway pole while posing in a marchesa chiffon dress and glittering badgley mischka peep-toe pumps  dark tresses tumbling down her shoulders. the headline: trans-it girl. because fame begets skewering  ms. shupak has even inspired a blog whose unprintable name approximates what is jamie shupak wearing? (we all love to be comfortable at work  but puke-colored khaki pajamas? reads one entry. no.) there  too  is ms. shupak in complex  a magazine aimed at cosmopolitan young men  for which she moonlights as an online dating columnist  taking on another of the citys most treacherous realms. i love the traffic  she said in an interview at a jane street cafe that was interrupted briefly when a female passer-by spotted her and mouthed i love you! through the glass. i love that youre giving people information that they actually will use. its a statement that could also apply to the complex column. some of ms. shupaks relationship advice: saying sorry shows that youre a man. refrain from updating your facebook status during a date. and never  ever  text a love interest while intoxicated. more on that later. advertisement since first appearing on ny1 in the summer of 2010  ms. shupak  who is 29 and 5 feet 1 inch and in real life looks like the younger sister  possibly still in college  of her made-up televised self  has become a new york personality  mixing up the channels morning report with her colorful diane von furstenberg dresses and some lively banter with the morning news fixture pat kiernan. she has 4 100 followers on twitter  far from al roker territory but a start. advertisement shes only on for a minute every half-hour  and yet within a few months of her arrival  people were talking about her and tweeting her and commenting on my interaction with her  mr. kiernan said. it takes some people years to have that level of familiarity in a media market as saturated as new york. the week when the united nations general assembly convened and president obama visited  one follower  jonathan wald  the executive producer of piers morgan tonight on cnn  commented on twitter: this is your royal wedding  superbowl  emmys and burning man all in one @jamieshupak. lets keep it moving. she has what i think is the key to success on television  and that is she looks like she feels like shes got the greatest job in the world  mr. wald said in an interview  adding that in reality  the hours alone are enough to kill you. ms. shupak grew up in suburban philadelphia and majored in communications at the university of maryland  with dreams  she said  of being a serious hard news reporter. the first job she was offered came from news 12 traffic and weather  on long island. i was like  i dont know any roads in new york   she said  but she took the job. she left after a couple of years to do freelance work for other stations  still determined to do the hard news thing. but she had a constitutional problem. every boss i had  they were like  you cannot stand in front of a house that just burned down and youre smiling. you have to stop smiling. i was like  i cant. i just couldnt. stick with the traffic  she was told. so she did  landing a fill-in job in philadelphia  then a full-time freelance deal at the philadelphia fox affiliate. that ended after about a year  in september 2009. she moved back to new york to freelance and live with her fianc  whom she had dated since college. in september 2010  she discovered that the fianc was seeing another woman  via a text message that popped up on his phone as she was getting ready for work  no less  ms. shupak said. (her ex disputed that in a brief telephone interview  saying he was not dating anybody else at the time and that it was not like that at all.) my life had been derailed like one of the commuter trains i report on each morning  ms. shupak wrote in a recent column. and like those trains  it only takes a split second for everything to go careening off course. advertisement but she stuck to her routine: awakening in her west village apartment at 3:20 a.m; cabbing it to ny1s headquarters  in the chelsea market building  keenly aware of the perils of keeping a car in manhattan. after a quick check to ensure there are no major disasters on the roads  she does her makeup and irons her hair (her natural curls are too unpredictable for tv)  while listening to otis redding or bruno mars on her iphone. around mascara time  she is joined by mr. kiernan; this may be the only time they are actually in the same room  as their tosses are filmed from separate locations. then its up to the ny1 rail and road studio  an isolated room down a hall and up a staircase  with bright green walls  thick dark shades that block the sun after dawn and a dozen screens showing various channels and maps. the first text of the day gives a hint as to why ms. shupak  who forswears even decaf  is so very perky so very early. its from her mother  helen  at 4:55 a.m.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mom: good morn sweetie pie. how ru? fun last night? (shed been out  but with an old friend  so its unclear whether it was technically a date.) another exciting day for u in jamieville? daughter: yea good good mama. how ru? mom: good. goin to gym. have a good day. love u. if you think the morning is a stressful blur of traffic-checking e-mails  fact-checking phone calls  furious script-scribbling  or rehearsals of what ms. shupak will say on air  youve got the wrong traffic reporter. ms. shupak seamlessly glides among a database listing delays and construction spots  colorful computerized maps showing traffic patterns  and instant messages from a producer giving her informational feeds in shorthand like rl (for right lane). during free moments  she trades e-mails with a romantically confused friend  listens to a sports podcast and tweets. then  somehow  just in time  she strides in front of a bright green wall  smiles  and delivers. in addition to reporting for ny1  she files reports for the stations geographically zoned 24-hour traffic channel and sister station  ynn hudson valley. mr. kiernan said he had received tons of positive feedback about his on-air interactions with ms. shupak. others  he said  have written in and said  why is pat wasting my time flirting with the traffic girl? for most of its 19 years  ny1 did not have a traffic reporter  relying instead on voiceovers from an outside contractor. that changed in 2010  when the station started the 24-hour traffic and transit channel  available to time warner cable subscribers in manhattan  brooklyn  queens  staten island  new jersey and the hudson valley. ms. shupak was hired  along with two other traffic reporters  who split the night and weekend shifts. it was an opportunity  said bernie han  the vice president of news for ny1. ny1 tends to be very regimented. people like the consistency of weather on the ones and rail and road on the eights  but i wanted to introduce a lighter element. advertisement it was that element that caught the attention of noah callahan-bever  the editor in chief of complex and an ny1 watcher. pat is so hilarious; hes so dry  mr. callahan-bever said. i obviously noticed that there was a new younger woman that was now sort of razzing him. mr. callahan-bever tweeted about it  and he and ms. shupak got in touch. her column had its debut in march. it wouldnt work for a mostly male audience if she was incredibly bitter or hung up on all the ways shes been wronged by either her ex or all the men shes encountered since then  mr. callahan-bever said. she is able to have a sense of humor about it  and i think that goes a long way. ms. shupak is no carrie bradshaw or amy sohn: there are no salacious details. she is at her best when documenting the unique challenges of dating in the age of twitter and texting  posting cringe-inducing screen grabs of texting exchanges like one from last new years eve. a sample: ms. shupak: ill come to u. tell me where. man she was interested in: 19th and park. are you serious? i just told you twice. js: k gimme a few. ill come to u. be patient man: meet at hurricane club js: where? im there man: 26th and park js: still there? js: where? im there. man: i dont really have the patience to keep up with your texts. unfortunately  ms. shupak did not gracefully end the conversation there. nor did she let it go to waste  posting the exchange with hopes that readers might learn just how dangerous texting under the influence can be. talk about news you can use. a version of this article appears in print on october 9  2011  on page mb1 of the new york edition with the headline: stuck in traffic? a star is born.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

sports,advertisement by yilu zhaoapril 3  2004  city halls where gay marriage vows are uttered  the superbowl half-time show and movie theaters showing ''the passion of the christ'' would seem to be prime battlegrounds in the latest culture wars. but to conservative crusaders like david horowitz  the main action is still on college campuses  which he insists have been colonized by ''tenured leftists'' and turned into ''their political base.'' so mr. horowitz  author of ''left illusions: an intellectual odyssey'' (spence publishing  2003) and the president of the center for the study of popular culture  is spearheading a campaign to end what he calls discrimination against conservative faculty and students. at its core is an ''academic bill of rights '' written by mr. horowitz  that asks universities  among other things  to include both conservative and liberal viewpoints in their selection of campus speakers and syllabuses for courses and to choose faculty members ''with a view toward fostering a plurality of methodologies and perspectives.'' the campaign  which is resurrecting the disputes that characterized the culture wars' first wave in the 1980's  has caught the attention of republican legislators and conservative student groups  much to the chagrin of many university administrators and faculty members. on march 23 the georgia senate passed a nonbinding resolution almost identical to the bill of rights drawn up by mr. horowitz  who had flown in to testify before the senators on liberal bias. in mid-march a similar bill was withdrawn from the colorado legislature after the presidents of four universities  including the university of colorado  agreed to publicize their grievance policies on campus and pledged to make their institutions open to all political viewpoints. meanwhile  jack kingston  a republican congressman from georgia  has introduced mr. horowitz's bill as a nonbinding resolution in the house of representatives. advertisement ''we are only trying to get their attention '' mr. horowitz said  referring to university administrations. he said he was turning to legislative lobbying only as a last resort  after having waited unsuccessfully for a year for the state university of new york to adopt his bill of rights. ''i am using the legislative resolutions as an inducement to have universities look into this. i have no intention of going to congress to impose a politically correct faculty on a university.'' advertisement ''some people have no problem to have the government come in to meddle on the basis of skin color '' he added. the bill  he says  is based on the tradition of academic freedom  but many scholars argue that the legislative approach adopted by him and his followers could erode the very freedom the bill champions. although several congressional aides said mr. horowitz's bill of rights had little chance of passing  the american association of university professors  a washington-based nonprofit organization that first codified principles of academic freedom in 1940  has posted a rebuttal to the bill on its web site  www.aaup.org. ''the danger of such guidelines is that they invite diversity to be measured by political standards that diverge from the academic criteria of the scholarly profession '' the statement says. it also argues  for example  that ''no department of political theory ought to be obligated to establish 'a plurality of methodologies and perspectives' by appointing a professor of nazi political philosophy  if that philosophy is not deemed a reasonable scholarly option within the discipline of political theory.'' at the heart of the dispute is whether the kind of bias cited by mr. horowitz -- the discrimination against scholars with right-leaning views in hiring and promotion and the stifling of conservative student opinions -- is indeed prevalent. last year the center for the study of popular culture surveyed the political opinions of professors in the humanities and social sciences at 32 top universities and concluded that democratic views vastly outnumbered republican ones at each of them. to many of mr. horowitz's supporters  that is strong evidence.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. ''we have 60 members in the department of government '' said harvey mansfield  a well-known harvard professor. ''maybe three are republicans. how could that be just by chance? how could that be fair? how could it be that the smartest people are all liberals? many liberals simply don't care for the kind of work conservatives do.'' many academics interviewed for this article who described themselves as democrats acknowledged that college faculties were dominated by liberals  partly as a result of leftist activists' entering academia in the 1960's. the question  which has been roiling for nearly two decades now  is whether that has meant a smothering of conservative views. advertisement stanley fish  the dean of the college of liberal arts and sciences at the university of illinois at chicago  fumed at the suggestion that a liberal conspiracy existed among faculty. ''i have interviewed 250 job candidates in the last five years '' he said. ''there is no room at all  in the hiring process  which is heavily scripted  for revealing political and religious orientation.'' ''the question you should ask professors '' he said  ''is whether your work has influence or relevance.'' ''a public resolution that is on the record has its own coercive force '' added mr. fish  whose work on postmodernism as an english professor has long drawn the ire of conservatives. ''it can lead faculty members and students to feel that they are under surveillance.'' mary burgan  the general secretary of the american association of university professors  said that universities already had guidelines against any kind of discrimination -- including political -- and that each year the organization itself looked into 6 to 10 accusations of bias  including ones made by conservatives. students for academic freedom  a campus organization working closely with mr. horowitz  has a web site  studentsforacademicfreedom.org  where students can report incidents of discrimination. in 2001 mr. horowitz led a campaign to place advertisements in college newspapers denouncing calls for slavery reparations to black americans. at brown university  where one of the ads ran  student protesters destroyed copies of the brown daily herald and demanded it pay ''reparations'' by giving free advertising space to proponents of reparations. (the paper refused but expanded space for opinion articles the day after the incident.) mr. horowitz spoke at brown in october at the invitation of the brown spectator  a conservative magazine founded by stephen beale  a senior  and christopher mcauliffe  a junior  who have asked the student council to pass the academic bill of rights. ''we are trying to get the university to say on the record that we embrace intellectual diversity '' said mr. beale  the son of a theology professor from massachusetts. mr. mcauliffe  a florida native  said: ''i have been assigned marx four times at brown. adam smith? not even once.'' were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,for those who missed the q&a with the timess greg bishop yesterday  im moving it from the comments section and making it a separate post. (greg didnt get a chance to answer questions until evening because he was traveling to seattle.) steve glaser just three questions/comments: 1. doesnt favre (and his arm) look tired? his production and accuracy as well as deep ball ability seem to decrease each week. greg bishop: good evening everyone  and sorry for the delay today. im actually on assignment this week  and this is the first chance i could get to answer all these questions. i will try and get through all of them. for starters  favre has been asked this question in a million different ways over the past month. i will agree that he does indeed appear to be tiring  but thats only from my own personal observation. he says he doesnt feel any worse than before. 2. do the players like or respect mangini? seems theres no fire. greg bishop: its tough to get an honest answer from players about how they feel about their coach. i will say that players seem to like mangini more now than they did previously. thats in large part because of the things he has done  starting a players committee to handle issues  shortening practice times  especially during training camp  etc. i agree with most fans who wish they could see more fire from mangini. i can also tell you there wont be any more coming. 3. love leon w.  but why does he let so many punts bounce instead of fair-catching? greg bishop: excellent point  steve. he should have fielded or fair-caught both punts that were downed inside the 5-yard-line against the bills. mangini said this week that the worst-case scenario on punts like that is to have them bounce inside the 10 and down near the goal line. gene how is it possible for the jets run defense to go from stellar to just plain awful so rapidly? is jenkins hurt? why does it look like the whole defense has forgotten how to tackle? wheres the pass rush? greg bishop: gene  i think you hit on all the answers in your question. jenkins is bothered by nagging hip injury  one that appeared on the injury report last week. he has not seemed like himself the past few games  but part of that could be because of the constant double teams hes facing  and part of that could be from wearing down. now  tackling is a different story. that fred jackson run? the one where he dragged half the defense into the end zone? embarrassing. it would have been a huge deal had the jets not pulled off their miracle victory. joseph why is sutton still around? i thought he was a goner last year but he survived. at times it seems like hes just trying to prove he wont change. everybody (including the results) is crying for more blitzing but week after week he fields his pathetic pass rush. it puzzles me. greg bishop: joseph  this is a question ive been getting a lot lately. there really is not a definitive answer. last year  and again this year  mangini has been peppered with questions as to why he continues to employ bob sutton. his answers have yet to provide any insight. in suttons defense  there have been bright spots. last season  the jets defense played well after the bye week. of course  it came late in the season. this year  the jets have shown glimpses of a fearsome pass rush  and until three weeks ago  they stopped the run. what continues to mystify analysts is why the jets dont blitz more. watching replays of the games it is pretty obvious  the jets routinely rush three or four people at the passer  rarely more. when pressed  mangini claims to not have any problems with his pass rush. but the numbers are there  in plain sight  of the decrease in production. rich in atlanta 1. are we getting any more stability in the secondary or are we still juggling players? greg bishop: the jets are still in the process of finding the right combination  which is strange and scary at this point in the season. drew coleman  for instance  played against san francisco  but was inactive  some would say with good reason  again last week. what seems to have solidified are the starting cornerbacks  recently named pro bowler darrelle revis and ty law. side note: both went to aliquippa high school in pennsyvlania. 2. is there any sign that the jet braintrust plans to do anything about the consistent lack of pressure on the opposing qbs? greg bishop: see the above answer for a more detailed response  but the short one is this: no. the game plan has not changed in recent weeks. sunday another opportunity presents itself: seattle. the seahawks have line issues  will be without quarterback matt hasselbeck and have struggled to run the football. the stars appear to be aligning  3. do you think clowney will get more touches? greg bishop: he sure made one heck of a first impression. it all depends on special teams  though. say brad smith returns from the concussion this week. it would not surprise me if clowney was inactive. the more catches he makes like that  though  the more likely he is to be playing on sundays. 4. how is a billion dollar sports franchise unable to move a charter flight from friday to saturday? greg bishop: brilliant question. my favorite of the day so far. im stunned that was the explanation. kathie do you think the jets defense just had a bad game or is it a real problem? .. what do you think are going to be the keys on winning this sunday at sea? greg bishop: well  kathie  i think the jets defense has become its main problem. its not just the pass defense anymore. its the pass rush. its the rush defense. its all sorts of stuff. keys to winning in seattle: pressure quarterback senaca wallace  stop the run  force turnovers. seattle is a loud place to play  and this will be the final game for coach mike holmgren. the jets are going to need to win this one on defense. peter glaser 1. why is it that the jets seem unable to bring their a game whenever they play on the west coast; does the 3 hour time change really affect players that much? greg bishop: peter  i covered the seahawks for parts of six seasons before i moved to new york  and i can say this having seen it both ways  the jets struggles on the west coast are atypical. for a team like the seahawks  traveling across the country and playing in the 1 p.m. time slot is difficult  their body clocks are at 10 a.m. for the jets  traveling to the west coast should not have posed that kind of problem. theyre playing at 1 p.m. anyway. records for teams across the league bear this out. very few west coast teams have won at 1 p.m. after traveling. many east coast teams have won the other way. just not the jets. 2. also  ive noticed that in games theyve won  the jets typically run the ball and score early  whereas in games theyve lost  theyve gotten behind and abandoned the run before the end of the first quarter. why do you think the mangini is so quick to abandon a running game that is one of the top in the league? greg bishop: in the games in which mangini has abandoned the run  many times the jets havent had possession of the ball long enough to get enough offensive snaps. that still doesnt quite explain some of the games where thomas jones is limited to 10 touches  or leon washington is limited to three. steve may will the jets staff ever learn how to make adjustments? greg bishop: adjustments have posed a problem this season  but you have seen some from game to game  if not quarter to quarter. paul whats the jets salary cap situation this off-season and do you think theyll make a (lesser) splash in free agency or the draft? (id also be interested to hear what you think their biggest area of need is.) greg bishop: paul  i appreciate the look ahead. the jets have a lot of money tied into the players they traded for or signed this past off-season  alan faneca  kris jenkins  damien woody  etc. brett favre will again have a high cap number  but that could change depending on if he retires or decides to play another year (at 40  unreal  but i digress). as for needs  three stand out. 1. secondary help: with dwight lowery  this years rookie cornerback  having a year under his belt  and with darrelle revis making the pro bowl this year  the jets could add another cornerback to either start opposite revis or cover the slot  with lowery moving back to the starting cornerback position that he lost. 2. quarterback: should favre retire  as many expect  the jets have kellen clemens and brett ratliff. clemens struggled in the games he started last season  but lets not be too quick to judge  because that came behind an awful offensive line. ratliff has been impressive. but thats still a lot of question marks at one of the most important positions. 3. kicker: the jets must decide if they want to re-sign mike nugent  the kicker they took with a very high draft pick in 2005. nugent was injured this year  in stepped jay feely  and now the jets have what you could call a place-kicking controversy. who would have thought? steven looks like the pennington/favre swap could backfire big time for the jets. is this perception sinking in anywhere in or around the organization and if it turns out to be the case are tannenbaum / manginis days numbered? greg bishop: i dont agree with the backfire  although it would be almost poetic if pennington knocked the jets out of the playoffs. that would be their worst nightmare come to life. i still think that youve got to make the favre trade. pennington had struggled last season (behind  we know  an awful offensive line). favre brought the jets instant recognition and psl money and a hall of fame arm that has played well  at times  this season. pennington has been a complete surprise. he deserves all the credit that he is getting. but at the end of the day  on aug. 15  if you had a choice between the two  who would you have chosen? now  if the jets do not make the playoffs  if they are bounced by  say  pennington and miami  absolutely i would say that eric mangini and mike tannenbaum would have some answering to do. i would expect the seats they sit on to heat considerably. george s. how long before our hearts are shattered? greg bishop: george  that was an extremely powerful question  one that cut to the heart of what it means to be a jets fan. and you did it in one sentence. my editors wish they were so lucky  anyway  it just seems like its going to happen  right? the jets win a tough one here in seattle  the dolphins win again  and then there comes chad pennington next week to wreck the dreams of all the fans who loved him  or criticized his arm strength. that would be the typical jets ending. reason for optimism: more veteran leadership  including several signings who have won super bowls. we will see just what kind of leadership favre and faneca and company can provide. kirby whats the real deal with gholston? did the jets just make a lousy pick or is there any hope for this stiff? greg bishop: the jury is still out  and this will not be an answerable question for at least another year. gholston has struggled this season  there is no doubt about that. but there are plenty of linebackers  willie mcginest comes to mind  who did not make an immediate impact. i appreciate the fact  sounds like mangini  right?  that he is the sixth overall pick and expected to make an impact  if not an immediate one. remember  gholston is switching positions. he missed mini-camps. he still has time. but the spotlight isnt going to dim. chris was at the game on sunday and i noticed the defensive players were doing a lot of pointing/talking to each other before each snap  moreso than other teams  it seems. have you noticed this? is that a sign of confusion or is that just normal communication? greg bishop: normal communication. of course  when youre rotating as many defensive backs in as the jets are  it could increase. but this isnt anything out of the ordinary. alyse can you explain to me why inveterate jets fans keep pointing to favre  instead of the play-calling and suspect defense/secondary  as the problem  all-the-while suggesting their former never-winner/no-mvp pennington would have fared better? no ones negating the int record  but the man executes many successful drives that the coaches and defense then fail to support..just wondering what your take is. greg bishop: is that the voice of reason  i hear? im inclined to agree with you. the problems on this team do not start with favre. the problems in most games do not start with favre. no one is going to argue about the head-scratching interceptions  but the jets knew they were getting that when they traded for him. the main issues on this team are on defense and with play calling. those will ultimately determine the jets postseason fate  if there is one  more than favre will. ian do they really have a shot at beating a hot dolphins team  and if they do  will they be able to win a playoff game? greg bishop: let me phrase your question a different way. if you had asked it three weeks ago  it would have been: do the dolphins really have a shot at beating a hot jets team? see how quickly things change in the nfl? that said  the jets have not played like a playoff team the past three weeks. say they beat the dolphins  at home  which isnt a stretch. i think winning a playoff game would be. the jets simply have too many holes. a leaky secondary that could have to face a passing team like indianapolis. a pass rush that now crawls. of course  there is still time  not much  to right the course. mike demaio my comments today deal with the coach. i think its fair to point out that he took one team to the playoffs  his second team had no qb  and this team is 9-5. he deserves credit for that before we jump all over him. my first question is what is the strategic advantage to calling a timeout at 2:06? other coaches do it  and i dont get it. i wish someone could explain this to me. greg bishop: mike  always a pleasure. the short answer is that the jets could have forced a punt  if all went according to plan  with taking the least amount of possible time off the clock. essentially  by calling the timeout  they forced two plays in six seconds. but yes  i agree with you that this falls under curious but often-used nfl strategy. 2. ive watched sundays post game press meeting twice now (yes  i need a life). i thought maybe i missed something the first time. do you think he really believes that the fumble was primarily caused by his heroic team? correct me if im wrong  but werent the jets the benefit of one of the worst play calls in recent memory? compounded by a qb not knowing when to throw the ball away? yes  the defense made a play (how amazing is elam?)  good for them. but doesnt he realize that his offense slept-walked thru the 2nd half  failing to get even one first down after a great return  down 3 with 5 minutes to go and their season on the line. did his defense just give up 27 points to a team that had scored a total of 6 points the last two weeks? i really dont get it. as horrible as the play call was  i give jauron a lot of credit for being man enough to step up and take full responsibility for it. for all we know the play caller made the call. regardless of the call  the qb screwed up big time. a big time coach takes the fall for the mistakes of those under him. kudos to ralph wilson for extending his coachs contract. mangenius should have acknowledged  in my view  his teams recent shortcomings  instead of trying to make it sound like his inspirational talk all week about find a way to win the game was the reason the ball bounced into elliss lap. give me a break. greg bishop: well put  mike  on all counts. the spin afterward left me a little dizzy. the whole talk of mangini telling them they were going to win  he didnt know how  but they were  and then this crazy miracle fell into their laps. i mean  come on. if the bills just run the ball there  they win. plain and simple. of course  crazy things happen in the nfl  but they are unexpected  as this obviously was. 3. we all can see how poorly this team is playing. i would suggest a simple acknowledgment of this would go a long way towards keeping his critics at bay. for him to pretend its not happening makes me wonder how much of a handle he has on the situation. you cant fix something if you dont think its broke. again  eric  we have eyes  we can see the game. does he talk to his team like this? he keeps saying things like we talk all the time about our core values i could see him after the game congratulating them on sticking with the core values. if he talks like this to them  its no wonder they dont play hard for him greg bishop: short answer: yes. 4. finally  a respectful shot at you and your colleagues. i heard someone ask favre how he felt about thomas jones great year. is that an attempt at serious journalism  or just a desire to suck up? after a game like that  why would anyone care what he thinks about that? how come you or someone else didnt ask him something like it seems youve played below par for three weeks in a row now. is there any reason to think you can reverse that trend? and by the way  what is the problem? greg bishop: fair enough  mike. we spent a lot of time criticizing people  so i think its fair to ask that question. this will give you a little insight into my process: i skip favre in the post-game and usually go for only half of mangini. i find i have more success working the locker room than fighting to ask questions with two dozen of my closest friends. i would add that favre has been asked a bunch about all the criticism he has taken. but i do see your point. walt bennett greg  i have no questions for you today  because i know you have no answers. well all just have to wait and see. regards  walt greg bishop: walt  i just about fell out of my chair on that one. you  sir  are a riot. answers? guilty as charged. just try and figure this team out  and they will do something the next week  good  bad or awful  that you never expected. would you prefer it any other way? wdef why is it the jets always seem to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and break their fans hearts? seriously  in your opinion why do you think that the jets over the past 40 years have been unable  other then a few glimmers here and there  to be a successful franchise? is it because being in the nyc area they dont have to worry about attendance or revenue? is it because the jets manage to be owned by people who dont really care to win? though if it were being in nyc  then the giants would not have the 3 superbowl victories since the 1980s greg bishop: the jets have been losing longer than i have been alive. the first thing i did when i started the beat was read gang green by the longtime and excellent times beat reporter gerry eskenazi. he sums it up better than i ever could. i will add this  however. i covered the seahawks team that won a playoff game in 2005 for the first time in more than 20 years. and i do believe that losing for a long time  in strange ways  will eventually wear on the psyche of a team  even if the players are far removed from the old days. i think that plays into it  that here-we-go-again mentality. steve after watching both defenses in the steeler  ravens game  the jets d has a long  long way to go toward scaring any qbs. there is no fire. do you see them making any pass rush adjustments over next 2 weeks? or will we see more of this coverage d? greg bishop: i wish i could say that i see it  but i dont. the jets seem content to not send too many guys after the quarterback. if they are going to do it  this week (see above) would seem ideal. jl if i was mangini  in these last two games  i would: set the linebackers loose! either they put the opposing qb on his back or we go home. get conservative on offense! run first: give thomas jones and leon washington 40 carries a game  combined. theres a lot of talent and money on that ol  challenge them. use the run to set up the favre play action. thats how favre and gb got to the nfc championship game last year. greg bishop: sounds like a solid blueprint. some of your fellow fans might disagree with the second point  though. theyve been asking me for weeks why the jets havent opened up the offense. herb why arent they running the ball more to keep their lousy defense off the field.they have two of the best running backs in the league and the highest payed offensive line. the only way to protect a suspect d is by controling the clock and keep the offense on the field  and of course score some points.some of the biggest plays this season have been from simple running plays. a more consistent running game will also open up some big pass plays. greg bishop: good point  herb  and for more proof  just look at the games the jets won. in most of them  they ran the ball effectively. or look at the times that favre has thrown deep. most of those plays were set up by the run. the good news  for you fans at least  is that snow is on the ground here in seattle. and more is predicted for the weekend. so you could see conditions in which the jets may have to run the ball  putting this theory to the test. scott 1. who are the likely candidates to replace sutton next year? ive heard crennels name mentioned  but wouldnt he want to return to new england in some capacity before becoming manginis subordinate? clearly mangini isnt much of an xs and os guy and crennel might think its beneath him to report to someone of manginis limited experience? greg bishop: crennel is the obvious name  but i wouldnt count sutton out yet. i didnt think the jets would bring him back this season  but they did. remember the rob ryan rumors? that said  you make a good point on crennel. he and mangini were always at or near the same coaching level. i wonder if hed want to come in as a no. 2. 2. also  assuming the favre expiriment is a 1-and-done  whos got the edge on starting qb next season? clemens seems to be the obvious choice but ive heard theres a lot of support for ratliff among the players and coaches. any chance we have a diamond in the rough in ratliff? greg bishop: at this point  youd have to give the edge to clemens. he does have starting experience. he was in a competition to become the quarterback in training camp. the coaches are really high on ratliff  too  but clemens would have the edge based on experience. mike do you have any observations about brian schottenheimers play-calling during the recent mini-swoon? during the win streak  particularly the tennessee game  the jets seemed to be calling many more quick-release slants  screens  and other fast-paced short stuff that kept the defense on its heels. lately the team has slowed and often stalled  and schott seems to always call the wrong play just when the defense is ready for it. any thoughts? greg bishop: good question  mike. in the nfl  things change so quickly  so what analysts are saying is that teams have figured out the jets short passing attack. thats why the offense has looked so confused lately. what had gone so well during the winning streak hasnt gone well after it. teams are covering those short passes  which should lead to play action  but has not. normhud will joe namath be at the seattle game?  greg bishop: i doubt that he will be there  but im not sure. adam h why is it that the linebackers  who are involved in stuffing the run  dont seem to be that involved in either the pass rush or effectively dropping back into coverage? the secondary (or the non-revis/rhodes half) justifiably pick up a lot of blame for inconsistency  but i just dont see a lot of short passes/screens being broken up by certain converted des greg bishop: fair point. the jets have struggled in coverage  but part of that blame can be assigned by the linebackers. they also were missing david harris for much of the past month or so  leaving david bowens  a pass-rush specialist  covering more than the jets would like. calvin pace has also struggled at times in pass coverage  although im still amazed a man of that size can run the way he can. think  please which of these do you agree with: 1) leon washington allows the ball to bounce  as opposed to fair-catching because: a-its a risky catch b- letting it bounce out forces the opposing d to keep chasing it til the play is dead. c- poor ball judgement greg bishop: a pop quiz  i love it! my answer would be c  although it has been atypical of leon washington to mkae those kinds of mistakes. mangini basically said on monday that those balls should have been fielded or fair-caught. 2) is it possible to get this message across to the jets d: i dont care if we lose a game  make those tackles! 3) i think its still likely that brett will return next year; however  i also think based on his on-field stature  brett ratcliff will be an excellent replacementshould brett not be able to return. there is something in his posture that just remind me of favredo you agree? greg bishop: im with you 100 percent. i like the way that ratliff carries himself. i like the way he throws. i wouldnt be suprised at all if he turned into a diamond in the rough. william j sherman i have been a jet fan and a season ticket holder for a long time .. it has not been easy! it seems as though everytime it looks like we are getting something going poof! it is gone. i really think that big tuna was the only chance we had and that vinny t just wasnt up to making the summit sad to say we will see mangini run out of town before long. the way it is meant to be i can only suppose greg bishop: i feel for jets fans. one of my good friends  joe  is among the biggest jets fans you will ever meet. i can hear the frustration in his voice. i can see how he keeps waiting for the proverbial other shoe to drop. some team has to break the curse. right? jeff s 1. i think that tannenbaum and the rest of the front office have been given a pass on their incompetency of allowing pennington to go free agent and sign with a division rival. the party line is they had to do somethng by 4 pm the next day and didnt have time to arrange a trade. they should have been working on a plan b at the same time they were negotiating with the packers regarding favre. i cannot believe a team like minnesota or tampa bay wouldnt have been delighted to get pennington at a discount. and then to lie and say  well they did it out of respect for chad. give me a break. well see how much of a break chad gives them next sunday to thank them for allowing him to sign with whomever he wanted. greg bishop: this is a good and often overlooked point. the party line from the jets end is that they had to clear $6 million in cap space  and penningtons salary happened to match. plus  he wanted to play. now  to allow him to sign with a division rival certainly raised some eyebrows. i mean  bill belichick did it with drew bledsoe  but at least he received a first-round pick. i dont think anyone expected pennington or the dolphins to make this kind of turnaround  but youre right  the results could be absolute disaster. 2. the fact is their offense was not geared to favre. what good does it do to have a guy who can fling the ball downfield if you dont have receivers who can achieve separation downfield? and no more of this idiotic noodle arm charge on chad. take a loot at miamis passing statistics for this year and how many long receptions miami has. the fact is mangini and tannenbaum had no respect for chad. they couldnt wait to get rid of him despite the fact he led them to the playoffs 3 times in recent years and won a playoff game in san diego and came within a missed field goal of winning another in pittsburgh. they had chad penningtons offense. why not have chad pennington lead it. and when favre reitres after this year  theyll be left with nothing. what a bunch of morons the front office was this year. greg bishop: harsh words  but definitely worth discussing depending on how these final games play out. one thing i would add is that pennington was no lock to be the jets starting quarterback in the first place. he did appear to be winning the job  but it was a competition. jim stanford it seems the jets coaching staff has had trouble making adjustments at halftime of games. also  when the momentum shifts during a game and the jets get into a rut  particularly on offense  it seems the coaching staff does little to change things around  other than standing there looking slightly dismayed. thoughts? greg bishop: jim  i addressed this a bit earlier. the simplest answer is that they have not adjusted well  that they stick too much to the script and dont go as much with the hot player/plays they have in the play book. this will be something to follow down the stretch. l. taylor why do you think the giants are so much better than the jets? is it the coaching? the talent? the history? the superior look and style? the prideful reference to greatness as opposed to the cheesy green west side story reference? the stadium name constantly reminding the jets of their second-class status and inherent inferiority? their 14-year-old boston educated coach? that festering  impossible-to-get-over crush on broadway joe? i dont hate the jets. i just dont understand why they fail  and fail  and fail  and the giants are just so damn classy. explain. greg bishop: ouch. jets fans on this board can probably relate to what youre saying  even if they dont appreciate you saying it.  kevin clarke l. taylor  giants fan since 2/08. greg bishop: double ouch! rich in atlanta 1) are you starting to wish youd showed up at 9:00 a.m.? greg bishop: yes! mike demaio i just want to thank you  im sure everyone who writes in agrees  for taking the time to put up with us hapless jets fans. greg bishop: i appreciate you guys as well. i appreciate your enthusiasm  your knowledge of the team and your tortured history. next week will probably be similar since i will still be in seattle. feel free to post questions during the day  and i will do my best to try and find time to answer all of them. joseph did the jets have a shot at michael turner? greg bishop: this is a good question to end things on. i dont see that happening  not with the players they have under contract. or with how turner has played. comments are no longer being accepted. the new york times will report on the giants and jets throughout the season. you can also find links to coverage from around the league  tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.     the content on the fifth down blog is moving to the pro football page on nytimes.com.readmore     the jets receiver became a critic of the game and its role in american society. but the decision to walk away was also personal.readmore     john idzik  the general manager of the jets  will not retain scott cohen  the assistant general manager. ari nissim  another high-ranking executive  also will depart.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  answers questions from readers.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  will answer questions from readers.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,advertisement by mark scottfeb. 6  2015  london  for many  soccer remains the beautiful game. but for others  it has become more like moneyball. just how much the sport has been transformed into a business was on show on friday as the television rights for the english premier league  the worlds most-watched domestic soccer league  were auctioned off to the highest bidder. the price of the television rights for british broadcasters is expected to rise more than 50 percent  to around a combined 4.5 4.5 billion pounds  or $6.9 billion  for the three-year period starting in 2016. the premier league will likely pocket an additional $3 billion when it sells the rights to international broadcasters  including those in the united states  later this year. friday was the final day to submit bids for the television rights  and an announcement about which companies won the auctions could be made as early earlier as saturday. a second round of bids may be required if several broadcasters submit similar offers  which may postpone an announcement until next week. advertisement as part of the process  the premier league is selling the rights to 168 soccer games that are divided into seven tv packages  each of which must be bid for separately. no broadcaster can win the rights to show more than 75 percent of the games. advertisement despite the high price tag  live sports are an ever-important strategy for broadcasters and advertisers. as people turn to online streaming services like netflix to watch television programs and movies  sports programming is one of the few remaining television categories to consistently attract large audiences.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. that is particularly true for the english premier league  whose games are broadcast to more than 170 countries and are watched regularly by more than three billion people worldwide  according to the english premier league. in contrast  roughly 160 million people tuned in to watch nfls superbowl earlier this month. in britain  the tv rights sale has pitted the satellite tv-provider sky  which is part-owned by rupert murdochs 21st century fox  against bt  the countrys former telecom monopoly  which has pushed aggressively into offering live sports alongside its traditional broadband services. a number of other potential bidders  including discovery communications  the american television group that is partly controlled by the billionaire john c. malone  may also bid for the right to broadcast games that include global soccer brands like manchester united  chelsea and arsenal. currently  sky broadcasts 75 percent of the 154 english premier league games a year  while bt has the right to show the remaining 38 games. with the popularity of the countrys national sport remaining strong  analysts say the price that broadcasters must pay to hold onto the tv rights is expected to rise. this years rights auction will show how far bt and sky are prepared to go to keep hold of what they see as an essential asset for their future success  said paolo pescatore  a media director at the consultancy ccs insight. with so much at stake  we can expect to see a frantic bidding process. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,after two weeks of non-stop  searing comparative analysis of the super bowl matchup  you might ask: whats left to discuss? pants. simply speaking  two teams with yellow pants is too many teams in yellow pants.   the packers whirl of forest green and cheddar cheese yellow pitted against the steelers black and frenchs mustard yellow summons thoughts of meals i hope to never have: squash and bananas. a lemon and saffron sandwich. couscous and buttery corn on the cob.  a plate of mustard and  well  you get the idea. it is  to borrow a word beloved by sports talk radio  a violation. it might sound preposterous  but it is a violation of football aesthetics. its not that i abhor yellow. its a fine color for a living room wall.  or a van gogh painting.  but you would not want your sofa to also be yellow. ill bet a bowl of m & ms that there will be people grumbling into their beer sunday because they are not always 100 percent sure who has the ball. add some mild color blindness and you might even hear someone pine aloud for their old black and white tv.  a super bowl matchup with proper color disparity was superbowl xiii. the steelers facing the cowboys provided a stark differentiation in uniform  the black vs. white  which almost casually underlined the narrative for the game. the steelers black was a perfect embodiment of their gritty  blue collar reputation vs. the gleaming silver and white of the sanctimonious cowboys.  on the flip side  you had the giants and patriots playing in super bowl xlii  about which i can hear the likes of tim gunn saying with pursed lips and stentorian tone  just too much blue! in this super bowl  like that one  to tell the teams apart  keep your eyes on their helmets.  the new york times will report on the giants and jets throughout the season. you can also find links to coverage from around the league  tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.     the content on the fifth down blog is moving to the pro football page on nytimes.com.readmore     the jets receiver became a critic of the game and its role in american society. but the decision to walk away was also personal.readmore     john idzik  the general manager of the jets  will not retain scott cohen  the assistant general manager. ari nissim  another high-ranking executive  also will depart.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  answers questions from readers.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  will answer questions from readers.readmore follow advertisement

sports,seattle outmatched denver from the beginning of the game to the end  crushing peyton manning and the broncos offense. times reporters  editors and photographers offered updates all day and throughout the game on everything from the weather to the commercials  from the traffic to the halftime show. they even mixed in some football analysis.    11:01 p.m.another season comes to a close    photo  the seahawks celebrated their super bowl victory in the locker room.credit john branch/the new york times   even the most ardent fans of the seattle seahawks were likely not predicting super bowl xlviii to be so lopsided. from the flubbed snap on the games first play right up through the fourth quarter  seattle outplayed the denver broncos in every way. a week that was dominated with talk of peyton mannings legacy ended up with one of the most embarrassing losses in super bowl history  and manning was largely responsible for his teams struggles. this super bowl proved a number of things: experience can sometimes be less important than talent; a great defense and a good offense beat a great offense and a mediocre defense; and just because you call something the first cold-weather super bowl does not mean it will actually be cold. metlife stadium proved to be a good site for the actual game  with the main issues centering on the inability to provide adequate public transportation for the 80 000-plus fans in attendance. whether or not there is another outdoor super bowl in a cold-weather city is uncertain. commissioner roger goodell was noncommittal when asked about plans for more. but it would be surprising for the league not to try again after this experiment has seemingly been a huge success. as the few remaining fans (all of whom appear to be seahawks fans) linger in the stadiums lower seats  the n.f.l. season is officially over.  benjamin hoffman     10:47 p.m.sherman sounding like not-sherman   apparently all of richard shermans powers of braggadocio were contained in his injured ankle. his postgame comments  even if they were screamed  seem like the words of a much more humble and gracious man than the one the world met after the n.f.c. championship game. we had a lot of hard work  a lot of dedication and the team deserves it  sherman said. russell wilson  earl thomas and kam chancellor  they deserve this. the legion of boom  baby. i hope we etched our names in the history books. this is the no. 1 offense in the history of the n.f.l. and we were able to play a good game against them. peyton manning may go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game  and were just blessed to have an opportunity to play against him. i cant believe it.  benjamin hofffman     10:44 p.m.the seahawks have left the building    photo  seahawks players left the field after winning the super bowl.credit chang w. lee/the new york times       10:41 p.m.lynch opens up   marshawn lynch was noted for being tight-lipped all week. he kept that up in his press availability after the game. he answered three of the questions with a total of 12 words. but he did open up about not celebrating on the field: man  they know how i feel about it. this is big time. this has been a tradition since i came  since forever. its just what i do. everybody knows it. they respect it. for lynch  that was quite a bit of talking. for his teammate richard sherman  that would barely be enough words to clear his throat.  benjamin hoffman     10:35 p.m.harvin discusses kick return   we had bounce-right  counter-right. we were calling for it all week. we knew it was a good chance. we had to put that on film all year  and the guys did a heck of a job blocking. as soon as i caught the ball it was open field.  percy harvin on his 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.  benjamin hoffman     10:20 p.m.fourth-quarter ad update    the whistle has blown  the seahawks have won and the ad bowl within super bowl xlviii is over. a quick wrap on the last quarter: 11 spots  by my count  on par with the third quarter  also 11  confirming previous patterns of networks running more spots in the first half than in the second half  as insurance against just the kind of lopsided result there was sunday night. many might say the ad bowl saved the best for last  or at least the most-watched and most-liked before the game for last  in that puppy love spot for budweiser ran in the fourth quarter. it kicked off an all-nice  all-awwwwww  hap  hap  happy commercial pod; it was followed by a cheery song in a godaddy spot and the second of two doritos spots that won a consumer contest  which featured a boy  a dog and a cute ending. (question for the creator of the doritos spot: do kids really still play cowboys  or is that something out of dennis the menace?) another notable ad in the fourth quarter was for sodastream  featuring scarlett johansson. it had a different line from a previous version because fox would not let the company knock coca-cola and pepsi-cola as it wanted to do. (the spot fox would not run was uploaded to youtube  a strategy that sodastream followed last year  too  when cbs rejected a coke/pepsi poke in an ad.)  in an unfortunate juxtaposition  the sodastream spot was preceded by one of three ads for t-mobile; the third t-mobile spot was a plain-looking thing  with only text on screen  and joked that maybe next year t-mobile would run an ad with overpaid movie stars. then came the sodastream spot with ms. johansson. oops! the 11 ads in the fourth quarter  added to 11 in the third  17 in the second and 15 in the first  brings the super bowl xlviii ad count to 54. that is about par for recent ad bowls. looking back across the entire evening  there were some dominant themes and approaches among the spots. patriotic appeals and celebrations of americana were plentiful  in ads for  among others  weathertech  chrysler and coca-cola. as noted in a previous post  the parade of stars was one of the biggest in recent super bowls  with the later quarters adding to the ranks ms. johansson  danica patrick  three cast members of full house  three british actors known for playing bad guys  johnny galecki  richard lewis  bob dylan  bruce willis  laurence fishburne and mandy patinkin. and there was  in general  a sweeter tone to many of the ads compared to previous years when sexy sales pitches  sight gags and sarcasm predominated. to be sure  there were some brands that sought to be daring  like butterfinger with the sex joke in the marriage counselors office. but brands like bank of america  beats music  budweiser   cheerios  chevrolet  coca-cola  doritos  godaddy  honda  microsoft and toyota took a higher road. be sure to come back here on monday  and check the print edition of the new york times  for another look back at all the ads of super bowl xlviii.  stuart elliott     10:17 p.m.fans asked to stay in place   an announcement was just made in metlife stadium that anyone hoping to use public transportation should remain inside the stadium until given further instruction. congestion is apparently so bad that the platforms cannot handle the waiting passengers. as the night starts to get colder  the success of the first cold-weather outdoor super bowl could be tarnished if fans are expected to stand around for too long. the line for the train at metlife is really long. #super bowl //t.co/q2a1imlzdc  steve eder (@steveeder) 3 feb 14   benjamin hoffman     10:16 p.m.smith gets m.v.p.    photo  seahawks linebacker malcolm smith was named the most valuable player of the super bowl.credit chang w. lee/the new york times   malcolm smith was named the super bowl most valuable player. the award had gone to an offensive player in 40 of the previous 47 super bowls  but smiths interception and fumble recovery were crucial to the seattle win. all week the teams secondary  known as the legion of boom  got the attention  but it was smith who intercepted a pass to clinch the n.f.c. championship  and once again he came up huge for his team. the third-year player was the 242nd pick in the 2011 draft.  benjamin hoffman     10:12 p.m.unused confetti   there is blue and green confetti everywhere  with plenty of it still floating in the air. my colleague steve eder points out there are cannons full of orange and blue confetti somewhere sitting unused  right? it makes you wonder if that confetti is then sent to lesser events  similar to the way the denver broncos super bowll xlviii champions t-shirts will all be sent to developing countries. what happens to all the unused orange and blue confetti? #superbowl //t.co/zsndkj3prm  steve eder (@steveeder) 3 feb 14   benjamin hoffman     10:07 p.m.the traditional handshake   chang w. lee/the new york times john fox and pete carroll after the game.     10:05 p.m.putting things into perspective   the concourse outside the open-air press box became a sea of orange as denver broncos fans fled. one man in an orange broncos jacket and cap  who said his name was mike  had three words for what had happened in the stadium. epic failure  he said. disappointing. its just football  though  you know what i mean? he said. theres more important stuff in life than football games. and no  he would not say what his last name was. im a family member of a player  he said.  james barron     10:01 p.m.puppy finds a best bud    i feel like that budweiser commercial made me want to buy a puppy more than buy budweiser  jacob giesler (@jacobgiesler) 3 feb 14  the most anticipated commercial of the super bowl  and thats because budweiser floated this ad out early last week  and it stars a puppy  finally ran during the two-minute warning. obviously  budweiser was hoping its heartstring-pulling puppy/clydesdale love story would get the most attention this late in the game. and that strategy backfired with a dreadful blowout that has put fans in a coma.  that said  you cant not love this commercial. hate bud. hate commercialism. hate bad super bowls. but you have to love the puppy.    lynn zinser     10:03 p.m.seahawks are just beginning   as the confetti was fired from cannons and fell back down onto the players heads  van halen played because a more recent song would just be far too scary. but for seattle  a brand-new team with a young roster  this could be the first celebration of many  and a fresh song would have felt more appropriate.  seattle won this game by sticking to the teams principles and exploiting the weaknesses of a team that until now did not seem to have any flaws. it was a perfect example of playing together to reach a team goal. while some fans left early  undoubtedly trying to avoid the transportation nightmare they experienced getting here  most of the fans made it through a noncompetitive game that at some point started to feel like a commercial for just how good the seahawks are.  every super bowl team has its share of players who suddenly believe they should be paid far more money and leave the team for greener pastures  but this team is filled with lower-round draft picks in their first few seasons  so they should have at least a few more years together to continue to dominate the n.f.l.  benjamin hoffman     10:01 p.m.giving thanks   chang w. lee/the new york times seahawk players prayed after winning the super bowl.     9:59 p.m.final: seattle 43  denver 8   thats it. a shockingly lopsided super bowl ends with a shockingly lopsided score. the seahawks win their first title  and peyton manning is the bridesmaid again.  the real star of the game was the seattle defense  which produced a safety on the games first play and never let up. the broncos didnt pick up a first down until the second quarter  but lost four turnovers and looked out of sorts all night.  seahawks quarterback russell wilson passed for 208 and 2 touchdowns (both the jermaine kearse) for seattle  but more important avoided the mistakes that haunted denver all night. in addition to mannings two interceptions  the broncos had four fumbles  losing two of them. manning finished with 34 completions (a super bowl record) and 280 yards  but he also threw two interceptions  including a crusher that malcolm smith returned for a touchdown in the second quarter.  adding to his forgettable night: this crushing defeat was mannings 12th postseason loss  the most in n.f.l. history.   andrew das     9:53 p.m.two minutes left   not surprisingly  tarvaris jackson (!) couldnt lead the seahawks into the end zone. so manning will get a couple more plays here and we wind it down. pete carroll  meanwhile  will join jimmy johnson and barry switzer in adding a super bowl ring to an n.c.a.a. football championship. well done. his team was unstoppable today.  andrew das     9:53 p.m.not much happening here    photo  peyton manning and the broncos offense stood around for most of the game.credit chang w. lee/the new york times       9:49 p.m.sherman is on crutches    photo  richard sherman leaves the game after an injury. officials say he will not return to the game.credit chang w. lee/the new york times   hes waiting just off the field  with his foot in a boot  to join in the celebrations.  andrew das     9:50 p.m.jackson is in for wilson   question: can tarvaris jackson call himself a super bowl-winning quarterback after this game? i say yes.  benjamin hoffman     9:48 p.m.fourth-and-11 and going nowhere   manning keeps trying  but at this point hes just padding numbers no ones going to remember. on fourth down he drops back and gets the ball knocked out of his hands by chris clemons as he throws. fumble!!! and of course seattle recovers it at the denver 29. theres 3:44 left and seattle can rub their noses in it if they want.  andrew das     9:46 p.m.richard sherman is in a good mood    photo  credit bob eckstein    bob eckstein     9:46 p.m.and then there were 13   with the seahawks about to win a super bowl for the first time  the list of teams that have never won it all has shrunk to 13. the minnesota vikings  buffalo bills  cincinnati bengals  philadelphia eagles  san diego chargers  atlanta falcons  tennessee titans  carolina panthers and arizona cardinals all came up empty in their super bowl appearances. the cleveland browns  detroit lions  houston texans and jacksonville jaguars have never even had the chance to lose. the browns and lions at least had a life before the super bowl  each winning n.f.l. championships before the creation of the leagues signature event.  seattle will now have championships in football and basketball (seattle supersonics in 1978-79). the rabid sports fans of their city can now focus their attention on getting the mariners and sounders to join the citys champions club.  benjamin hoffman     9:43 p.m.these broncos fans are unhappy  but warm   they are disconsolate  the denver broncos fans who have tickets that let them retreat to the huge  heated lexus club at metlife stadium. i cant stand to be outside waiting for my team to show up  said jim grunditsch of vail  colo. i can take three steps and get a painkiller  or stay outside  where seattle fans will wave towels in my ear. what would you do? jamie darvish  wearing a washington redskins jersey  said he too was rooting for denver. he said he had paid $6 000 for a ticket with a face value of $2 500  but he had his reasons for leaving his seat and going inside. its all seattle fans where we are  he said  so i will stay in here. if you had to pick two teams that have the most-chilled fans  it would be these two. oh  that was tough. sorry you missed that touchdown. but still.  james barron     9:40 p.m.third-quarter ad update        three quarters down  one to go  and already there is mumbling online about the lopsided score and whether advertisers in the second half of the game will regret their ad buys. that is why there historically have been more ads in the first half of a super bowl than in a second. also  the last few games were close until the final whistle  so buying later in the game is not on its face a foolish idea.           in any event  there were by my count 11 national spots in the third quarter  including a biggie from chrysler for the new chrysler 200 with a new theme  americas import  echoing imported from detroit with eminem from a previous big game.           this time  bob dylan replaced eminem and delivered a paean to american manufacturing and detroit that was the second such spot in the game  after weathertech in the second quarter.            and who would have bet that two commercials in a 2014 super bowl would feature mr. dylan  much less two in the same quarter? a chobani ad in the quarter used his song i want you.            (chobani brought another bear  too  after carmax and beats music. poor stephen colbert  he hates them!)          there were many kinder  gentler ads in the third quarter  among them the goldieblox girl power salute  sponsored by intuit; axe peaces paean to love; the heinz ketchup salute to happy; audis pitch for adopting rescue dogs; and a surprise honda spot with bruce willis urging hugs as a proxy for auto safety.          forty-three commercials down  by my count  lets see what the fourth quarter brings.  stuart elliott     9:36 p.m.the seahawks keep pouring it on    photo  doug baldwin scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter.credit chang w. lee/the new york times       9:35 p.m.thomas delivered  his team did not   demaryius thomas has 13 catches and was just targeted by peyton manning for the 17th time. he already holds the super bowl record for receptions  many of them coming against richard sherman  and has been the only thing working for denver. he may not come away with a super bowl ring  but he has had a memorable performance. unfortunately for the broncos  he has been the only thing working on offense all game.  benjamin hoffman     9:35 p.m.records? you talking about records?   manning has 33 completions and demaryius thomas has 13 catches. both are super bowl records. and nobody will care. the broncos turn the ball over on downs. just under 10 minutes left  and if this was a college game the walk-ons would be a getting a run.  andrew das     9:32 p.m.sherman leaving on a cart   he was helped off a few plays ago  limped behind the bench and now is riding to the locker room on a cart.  and you know what? he doesnt have to say anything today. as muhammad ali famously noted  it aint bragging if you can back it up.  andrew das     9:30 p.m.remember the orange crush years?   by my count  after tonight five super bowls will have been decided by 30 points or more. the broncos will have been on the losing end of three of them. update: yup  just checked. thats right: super bowls xxii (vs. redskins)  xxiv (vs. 49ers) and xlviii.  andrew das     9:27 p.m.enough is enough for broncos fans   those denver fans had traveled so far  paid so much and come with such hope. and with a quarterback like peyton manning  some could still believe  even down by 36-8 in the third quarter.  but the truth is  broncos fans have started heading for the exits at metlife stadium. more than one fan wearing a manning no. 18 has been spotted inching toward the door. and it might be their best play of the night  especially for those relying on public transportation on the reverse commute. a bottleneck at secaucus  n.j.  made for a long  tough  journey to the game for some.  while seattles big lead has made for a less competitive game  it might take some pressure off the transit system as the night wears on. broncos fans have seen enough. #letsbeatthecrowds //t.co/zflheeg9mb  steve eder (@steveeder) 3 feb 14   steve eder     9:26 p.m.seattle scores again. yikes.   denver really comes up small after ending the shutout. after recovering an onside kick and taking a penalty  seattle drives 58 yards in five plays  all wilson completions  including a 10-yarder to kearse for the touchdown.  its a slaughter. its bears-patriots. its ravens-giants. its 43-8.  troy aikman on fox: i dont know what denvers doing. none of us do.  andrew das     9:15 p.m.bob dylan: car salesman    bob dylan 1966: build a fire on main street and shoot it full of holes. dylan 2014: we will build your car.  nicholas thompson (@nxthompson) 3 feb 14  in the endless string of car commercials  it is hard to stand out. one way to do it: get bob dylan to remind you of your patriotic duty to buy american cars. chrysler rolls out the 60s icon to tell you its o.k. to buy asian-built cellphones or drink german beer  but we will build your car. you have to get over the idea that dylan is now selling cars in 2014  and we know not all of you will be able to  but if you can  its pretty effective.   lynn zinser     9:17 p.m.good news  denver fans   rockies pitchers and catchers report in 13 days.  andrew das     9:15 p.m.patrick stewart is the 12th man    //t.co/treodio498  patrick stewart (@sirpatstew) 3 feb 14      9:08 p.m.bruce willis hawks hugs    no bruce willis are you even watching it  jason kirk (@jasonkirksbn) 3 feb 14  the dreary competitive tone of the game apparently called for a bit of heartwarming stagecraft from madison avenue. so  in comes bruce willis  not usually mr. heartwarming  to tell us to hug all our friends. somehow this was a honda ad. too bad he started by saying  great game  huh? um  no. budweiser came next with a heros welcome for a solder coming home to winter park  fla. was probably a bit over the top  but hey  whos going to criticize for being to sentimental about soldiers? no one.    lynn zinser     9:10 p.m.there goes the shutout: manning to thomas   chang w. lee/the new york times wes welker falls into the endzone for the two-point conversion. here come the broncos baby!! well  not really. but manning finds demaryius thomas from 14 yards (really nice catch under pressure  by the way) to spoil the shutout. (that catch was his 12th  a super bowl record  and pushed him over 100 yards for the game. so  um  yay for thomas.) the broncos go for 2  and manning hits welker out of the backfield for the conversion. seahawks 36  broncos 8. theyre just spoiling betting pools now.  andrew das     9:12 p.m.broncos off the hook   with that touchdown  the broncos are off the hook. they will not be the first super bowl team to be shut out. they are  however  still down by 28.  benjamin hoffman     9:11 p.m.when it rains it pours for seattle  in a good way   chang w. lee/the new york times jermaine kearse scoring in the third quarter.     9:10 p.m.crowd sticking around (so far)   there has never been a shutout in the super bowl  but the lowest score by a losing team came in the last cold-weather super bowl. in super bowl vi the miami dolphins scored just 3 points with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees at tulane stadium in new orleans.  despite the broncos currently losing 36-0 and having possibly the worst ever performance in a super bowl  their fans have stayed remarkably resilient. there are few empty seats  and the color orange is prominent throughout metlife stadium. while some have headed for the exits  the others have just stayed standing in their seats in stunned silence as their teams rocket-fueled offense has looked absolutely pedestrian.  benjamin hoffman     9:07 p.m.where did it go wrong?   if only denver had had a signal early in this game that it wasnt going to be its day .  andrew das     9:06 p.m.smith for m.v.p.?   the super bowl most valuable player has been a defensive player seven times (in super bowl xii  two cowboys defenders shared the award)  and there is a strong likelihood that malcolm smith will make it eight. his pick-6 was completely demoralizing for the broncos  and his fumble recovery certainly seems to have wrapped things up as denver was moving the ball a little and suddenly was once again without the ball. the last defensive player to win was dexter jackson of the tampa bay buccaneers in super bowl xxxvii. its only too bad for smith that al davis is no longer with us. he loved nothing more than signing super bowl m.v.p.s to ridiculous contracts.  benjamin hoffman     9:02 p.m.from turnover to points   russell wilson with a short ball to jermaine kearse at the 23. he spins out of the first tackle  then another  then

taking the field after halftime     8:45 p.m.an ignominious record to watch   there has never been a super bowl shutout. the lowest total came in miamis 24-3 loss to dallas in super bowl vi  in 1972. its been 13 years since a team failed to reach double digits (ravens 34  giants 7 in 2001.) the broncos  meanwhile  have just punted again. after running a draw play on third-and-10. it lost a yard.  tick  tick  tick   andrew das     8:46 p.m.seahawks and n.f.c. west are here to stay   this seahawks team is outrageously good and is the second-youngest team in the league. they are crushing the greatest regular-season offense in n.f.l. history  and they are not even making it look hard. it really is an embarrassment of riches in the n.f.c. west  where the 49ers could easily be the team running away with a win here and the rams and the cardinals are a lot better than people realize. considering the hard-hitting nature of all four teams  the only thing holding them back in the next few years is how much they beat each other up.  benjamin hoffman     8:44 p.m.another take on the halftime show    photo  credit bob eckstein    bob eckstein     8:40 p.m.j.c. penney gets some buzz on

in the first half is that it did so without sacking peyton manning even once. they have limited manning to a passer rating of 46.3 with none of the broncos famous receivers managing even 10 yards a reception. the legion of boom got most of the credit for seattles defensive efficiency this season  but the teams front seven did have the eighth-most sacks in the n.f.l. if cliff avril and company can get to manning in the second half  this could get even uglier than it already is.  benjamin hoffman     8:29 p.m.rene flemings operatic opening   before the second half starts  take a moment to

the second quarter is done  meaning the first half of the ad bowl inside super bowl xlviii is done  too.       by my count  there were 16 commercials nationally in the second quarter  plus the pepsi spot that ran a moment ago to promote pepsis sponsorship of the halftime show.       three of the spots in the quarter were from advertisers that did not previously raise their hands to say they were buying time on the game: geico  sonos and subway. the geico and subway spots were not new; not sure about the sonos spot. spots not made for the super bowl  or making their debut on the game  are usually less liked than all-new ones  and sure enough  there have been several complaints on twitter already about the geico and subway spots.        other highlights included the following:       * the first of two spots for coca-cola was shown  with a very definitive message about diversity and inclusion  coming as coca-cola is facing protests from activists unhappy that the company  which is also sponsoring the winter games in sochi  russia  has not come out against the russian treatment of gays. in a news release  coca-cola said that it would show a longer version of the spot during the olympics. the multicultural  multiracial cast included a vignette that by my eye was meant to be a same-sex male couple with their daughter.         * weathertech ran its commercial about making its products in america  a topic very much in the news.          * some spots with sweet themes and content were shown  including the toyota highlander spot with the muppets serenade  the volkswagen spot riffing off the line from its a wonderful life about how angels get their wings and of course the coke spot.          the 16 spots in the second quarter  the pepsi spot and the 15 spots in the first quarter total 32 commercials beamed into living rooms and onto second screens nationally.          on to the second half.  stuart elliott     8:18 p.m.mars lives up to his word   chang w. lee/the new

were minimal and his band put on a good show. it seemed anticlimactic when you consider some of the megastars who preceded him  but he certainly acquitted himself well. and it was a good move by the n.f.l. to embrace a current artist  as the league has often been overly safe. of course  midway through the show the red hot chili peppers came out to sing songs that were popular 20 years ago  so its still baby steps. .@brunomars is killing it. hes still no @jtimberlake  but im with @nailajeanmeyers on this: why not have a current  non-washed-up star?  melissa hoppert (@mhoppertnyt) 3 feb 14

yards  2 interceptions.  anyone else identify the problem? the picks were crushing  sapping momentum and  of course  costing denver 7 points on the smith return. but 17 completions for only 104 yards? thats not nearly good enough for manning. the running games have been negligible: percy harvin is seattles leading rusher  with two carries for 45 yards  but 30 came on one reverse. marshawn lynch has 17 yards on 11 carries  while denvers knowshon moreno has 5 carries for 17.  andrew das     8:02 p.m.weather update   they have just turned off the heat lamps in the auxiliary press box for not-beyoncs performance. this is not making me like him more. but im willing to be turned around by a good show. so i hope he studied the black eyed peas performance in dallas and plans to do nothing like that.  benjamin hoffman     7:57 p.m.manning screaming at his line as half ends   fox cut away before we could see if one of them stood up and said: hey  how about you stop complaining about us? and stop throwing the ball to the other team while youre at it? and thats the half. maybe the broncos can hug it out in the locker room.  andrew das     7:58 p.m.halftime with not-beyonc   this game has been a little boring (unless youre a seahawks fan)  and in a few minutes the halftime show is going to star bruno mars  whom i will refer to as not-beyonc. in his news conference on thursday

the 20  but thats short of the first down. denver takes a timeout  then eschews the field goal and goes for it. bad idea. manning  under pressure  underthrows his receiver on the left sideline. so they get nothing.  andrew das     7:51 p.m.stephen colbert is nuts    you  stephen colbert got robbed! nobody should have their commercials anywhere near david beckham in his underwear.  page

you hung through the beefcake ad that was david beckham for h&m  you got the payoff. it was so fitting of a colbert bit that you would swear he wrote it. do you think he did?    lynn zinser     7:48 p.m.two-minute warning   manning has quietly  and quickly  moved the broncos to the seattle 27  or whats also known as field-goal range. at this point  given the way the half has gone  theyll take anything that gets that goose egg off the scoreboard.  andrew das     7:49 p.m.mannings legacy secure   chang w. lee/the new york times peyton manning has struggled in the first half.  unless things change rapidly  there will be plenty of jokes at peyton mannings expense after this game. some of the jokes will be deserved  but the truly unfortunate thing is that he will undoubtedly be judged as a failure to the legacy of john elway. that shows a selective memory by broncos fans  as elway won two super bowls  but also lost three  including a 55-10 drubbing at the hands of joe montana and the san francisco 49ers in super bowl xxiv. regardless of the final result  manning is an all-time great. if he were to come back and win a super bowl before retiring  his losses would be forgotten  just as they were for elway.  benjamin hoffman     7:45 p.m.holliday down by contact   denver keeps the ball.  andrew das     7:42 p.m.holliday fumbles the kickoff!   the officials give the ball to the

lee/the new york times malcolm smith runs an interception back for a touchdown  malcolm smith  with crucial interceptions in consecutive playoff games  had two career interceptions heading into this

among recent denver broncos quarterbacks  the strongest performer so far tonight is tim tebow  in something of an upset.  ben rothenberg (@benrothenberg) 3 feb 14  when t-mobile announced it had signed tim tebow for a super bowl ad  well  it was going to be worth watching no matter what. the ad used the irony of tebow being out of football perfectly  asking  what can you do with out a contract? part of the answer was find and tackle sasquatch. not bad. t-mobile hopes viewers like tebow better than n.f.l. coaches did.   lynn zinser     7:38 p.m.momentum? reversed  by a pick 6   manning is hit as he throws on third-and-long by orlando franklin  and the resulting duck is plucked out of the air by linebacker malcolm smith. and hes gone  returning it 69 yards for a touchdown!  the only part of the play smith bungled was his spike over the crossbar; after running more than 70 yards  he got only about nine feet high. oh well  they dont take points off the board for style. seattle 22  denver 0.  and the momentum that had been slowly shifting swings closed like a garden gate. wow.  andrew das     7:40 p.m.first quarter ad roundup     and the first quarter of the ad bowl inside the super bowl is complete. three quarters to go  assuming there is no overtime.      there were by my count 15 national commercials in the quarter  including two from the bud light #upforwhatever campaign  much promoted before the game; two from chevrolet  one with a charity component; one of two godaddy spots; another charity-themed ad  from bank of america; the first commercial from chrysler group  for the new maserati; and one of the winners of the annual crash the super bowl contest sponsored by doritos  inviting consumers to create ads.      overall impressions so far are mixed  with a notable  if not uncommon observation: lots of celebrities. three in the bud light spots  ellen degeneres in the beats music spot  john c. reilly supplying the narration in the turbotax spot; john turtorro helping a woman quit her job in the godaddy spot; u2 singing for bank of america; and jeff bridges narrating the hyundai genesis spot.      two charity ads in one quarter also seems to suggest a kinder kind of tone to the super bowl commercials.    stuart elliott     7:39 p.m.right place  right time  again   malcolm smith stepped right in front of a wobbling pass by peyton manning and took it back for a pick-six. it should be noted that it was smith who was in such fantastic position to catch richard shermans deflection in the n.f.c. championship game that won it for seattle. mannings second interception was an absolute crushing blow for denver.  benjamin hoffman     7:36 p.m.chancellor returns  denver still moving   kam chancellor has returned to the game  but denver has continued to show some movement for the first time this game. peyton manning is looking more animated and the denver half of the crowd is waking back up. a score here would certainly be good for helping this game avoid turning into a blowout.  benjamin hoffman     7:29 p.m.a first for the broncos   with 10:30 left in the first half  knowshon moreno bulls over the right side for denvers first first down of the game. is it the start of something? lets see them get another first. but dont think for a minute that 15 points is enough against peyton manning.  andrew das     7:29 p.m.chancellor shaken up   kam chancellor seemed to be o.k. when walking off the field after being shaken up on a kickoff  but if he is unable to return it is hard to quantify how bad that would be for seattle. one of the absolute keys to seattles style of play is the interaction between chancellor and earl thomas. losing either safety for an extended period would hurt seattle more than losing richard sherman  as hard as that is to believe (especially for richard sherman).  benjamin hoffman     7:27 p.m.chancellor hurt on kickoff   seattles kam chancellor  the hard-hitting defensive back  was injured making a tackle on the kickoff after the seahawks touchdown. always a peril when a starter plays on special teams. hes walked off on his own.  andrew das     7:26 p.m.the other guy delivers   both golden tate and doug baldwin spent the week being asked about the return of percy harvin. while both remained optimistic that harvin would be a huge help to the team  they also could be excused if they wanted some credit for helping get seattle to the super bowl. one thing cited by all of the seahawks was the presence harvin would provide and how that would open things up for the other receivers. so far that seems to be working as baldwin is the teams leading receiver with 3 catches for 50 yards while harvins contributions have come on running plays.  benjamin hoffman     7:24

yourself if you dont think it feels as if it should be a lot more.  andrew das     7:20 p.m.radio shack loves the 80s    did radio shack just admit they are old and outdated?  ken boxx (@kboxx97) 3

paul sancya/associated press       7:18 p.m.its all seahawks   turnovers and time of possession are often what people look to when trying to decide who will win a game. so far  this one is all seattle. there are many slightly chilly fans wearing orange who are having second thoughts about paying four figures to go to a football game.  benjamin hoffman     7:16 p.m.end of 1st quarter: seattle 8  denver 0  manning m.i.a.   denver is actually pretty lucky its still a game. if the broncos defense hadnt held seattle to two field goals  theyd be in danger of getting blown out in the next few minutes.  andrew das     7:15 p.m.know when to say omaha   sometimes omaha means omaha and hurry means hurry. and sometimes  it seems  the offensive linemen of the denver broncos arent sure which is which. that  at least  seemed to be what happened on the first play of the super bowl. quarterback peyton manning stepped toward his linemen to scream instructions when the ball went flying past his head. perhaps center manny ramirez misunderstood the snap count or saw manning move in anticipation of a snap. or perhaps manning was being manning and tried to call a new play based on how seattles defense lined up. manning  after all  is the master of the audible who uses a complex matrix of code words to alert his teammates of new plays while simultaneously deceiving defenses. the system works particularly well when manning plays at home because broncos fans (and colts fans before them) lower their voices so the broncos can hear mannings calls. during a playoff game against the chargers several weeks ago  it was so quiet that microphones near the field picked up manning yelling omaha dozens of times. but at metlife stadium  manning lined up near the seattle end zone where many seahawks fans were sitting. could the 12th man have helped their team score the first 2 points of the game?  ken belson     7:12 p.m.another three and out for manning?   nope. even worse: manning overthrows julius thomas down the middle on third down and the ball lands right in the arms of seattles kam chancellor at the denver 37.  ruh roh.  richard sherman  your thoughts?  are you kidding me?!?! youre going to try to come over the middle with a sorry throw like that! dont you ever throw that ball! thanks  richard. talk later?  andrew das     7:11 p.m.going for hits  getting picks   kam chancellor just did his best to lower the boom on wes welker. luckily for welker  chancellors 6-foot-3 frame is simply too tall to get a clean hit on a 5-9 wide receiver. he shot right over him. then chancellor showed his versatility  picking off manning and setting up yet another seattle drive on offense. the seattle secondary is easily looking as good as advertised.  benjamin hoffman     7:06 p.m.another field goal for seattle   wilson finds jermaine kearse in the end zone  but denvers nate irving pops the ball out of his hands  so hauschka comes on for another field goal. seattle now leads  8-0  in the third inning. i mean  first quarter. denver coach john fox used his challenge just before the third-down play  to question whether an incompletion was actually a lateral. (he was wrong.) but the challenge almost seemed as if he was just buying his defense a minute to try to figure out what the heck is going on. to their credit  theyre keeping manning in this game by forcing field goals. but theyve been on the field a lot in the early going.  andrew das     7:10 p.m.three scores  but a one-possession game    photo  the seahawks golden tate was tackled by the broncos nate irving  left  and brandon marshall.credit timothy a. clary/agence france-presse  getty images   the seahawks have now scored three times  and yet peyton manning and the high-powered broncos offense could tie the game with one touchdown and a 2-point conversion. while denver has shown little ability to move the ball against seattle  this game is still wide open. considering how much seattle has appeared to dominate on both sides of the ball  thats truly remarkable..  benjamin hoffman     7:04 p.m.turbo tax connects prom to taxes    well  turbo tax. good commercial until it turned out to be for turbo tax.  steve hofstetter (@stevehofstetter) 2 feb 14  turbo tax has turned up its ad game for this tax season  with some nice  unusual ads this month  but its first super bowl effort really tested the edges of creativity. since when does a high school prom-looking dance have something to do with online tax filing? not sure i know even after watching it. but they get points for bold.   lynn zinser     7:04 p.m.lynch just playing his game   marshawn lynch has not done much so far (five carries for 6 yards)  but seahawks fans know a runner of lynchs style often takes quite a while to get going. on each play  denver is committing multiple interior players to bringing the big running back down  and over the course of the game those big players tend to wear down. if seattle shows a commitment to giving lynch the ball  hell eventually find holes that are not opening so far.  benjamin hoffman     7:01 p.m.wilson to baldwin makes it first and goal   make that 7 of 10 for wilson  for 82 yards  after doug baldwin runs under a beautifully floated pass over champ bailey for a 37-yard gain. first and goal at the 6. and denver cant seem to do anything to stop it.  andrew das     6:59 p.m.wilson looking great   russell wilson is 6 for 8 after a short pass to percy harvin  and the broncos cant seem to lay a glove on him. hes had plenty of time in the pocket  but when theres not enough  hes gone. all the broncos can do is chase.  andrew das     6:59 p.m.robinson shows versatility   michael robinson  who just reeled in a 7-yard catch  is useful for many things other than serving as the temporary voice of marshawn lynch (as he did during the seahawks media availabilities). the big fullback was a quarterback and wide receiver during his time at penn state. he is talked about a lot less than derrick coleman  but robinson is a solid football player who contributes to seattle in a number of ways.  benjamin hoffman     6:52 p.m.three and out for manning   the broncos go nowhere  a 3-yard run  and passes of 2 and 3 yards  but look at the bright side: at least they didnt go backward. eli manning pulls out his cellphone and texts peytons number. dude  when i won my two super bowls  hes what we did   andrew das     6:53 p.m.not impressed    so far  bud light and doritos are tied for worst super bowl commercial in 2014  ant (@soulvester) 2 feb 14      6:48 p.m.doritos gets a chuckle   the latest doritos ad is always much anticipated in the super bowl  and the first one wasnt a disappointment. it featured a kid-driven time machine that seems to work when dad comes out to discover his son has gotten old  or not. it wasnt worth a belly laugh  but worth a smile.   lynn zinser     6:51 p.m.know more about knowshon   it should be pointed out as often as possible that knowshon morenos name is a combination of his fathers nickname (knowledge) and his mothers name (varashon).  benjamin hoffman     6:49 p.m.here comes manning. again.   five minutes into the game  hell get to touch the ball for the first time  on denvers second play.  andrew das     6:49 p.m.it could be worse for denver   holding the seahawks to a field goal has to be seen as a victory for the broncos. off to a brutal start in which their one offensive play resulted in 2 points for the seahawks  the broncos now have the ball back and are less than a touchdown behind. as for the cold weather  it is official that super bowl vi will keep its title as the coldest super bowl on record. at kickoff it was a balmy 49 degrees  or 10 degrees warmer than the broncos and the dolphins had way back when.  benjamin hoffman     6:45 p.m.the challenge fails  but the field goal attempt doesnt   carroll was wrong  and itll cost him a timeout. a penalty pushes the seahawks back as they line up to kick  but steven hauschka laughs at your extra 5 yards  hahaha!  and bangs the kick from 31. seattle 5  denver 0 with 10:21 left in the first quarter.  if you thought that 5 you drew in your super bowl squares was never going to happen  things may be looking up for you.  andrew das     6:45 p.m.wilsons forgotten legs   its really easy to forget about russell wilson as a runner. the seahawks offense is focused so heavily on marshawn lynch that wilson flies under the radar in terms of his ability to scramble and do planned runs. but that speed  which he used to set up a fourth-and-1 (seattle challenged the play but the call on the field stood)  is a weapon not only on a broken play  but also to give him time to throw. denvers defense is nothing special  and chasing wilson all day will wear out their front seven.  benjamin hoffman     6:42 p.m.seattles drive stalls   seattle gets to denvers 14  but on third-and-6 russell wilson keeps the ball and rolls left  diving for the first-down marker. he ends up a yard short though  so seattle will have to settle for a field goal. but hold on  pete carroll is challenging the spot?

there was one thing that could unite broncos and seahawks fans on sunday: public transportation. as fans wearing both teams colors spilled into metlife stadium  a number were sharing tales of a horrible commute to the game. it was those who took trains from manhattan through secaucus who seemed to have gotten the worst of it. there  fans described a scene where it was hot  they guessed that it was over 95 degrees. they said they saw people fainting. some said people were urinating as they waited in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. it was an epic fail  said joe knittel  32  of seattle  after he spent four hours making his way to the game from manhattan  finally arriving about an hour before kickoff. even after making it through secaucus  he and his friends said they waited in a long line to enter the stadium. that  too  they said was problematic  as fans lining up outside the security screening tents freely cut in front of each other as busloads of people arrived  prompting arguing and shouting.  steve eder     6:25 p.m.the view from the ballroom    photo  credit bob eckstein    bob eckstein     6:20 p.m.all sherman all the time   seattle cornerback richard shermans postgame rant to the fox reporter erin andrews after the n.f.c. championship game  shortly after he made a critical defensive play that helped the seahawks reach super bowl xlviii  instantly catapulted him into the national spotlight. on the first day of player availability  shortly after the seahawks touched down in new york  sherman was surrounded by television cameras and reporters  about 20 people deep. meanwhile  the seahawks young star quarterback  russell wilson  had about only 20 people total lingering around his podium at the jersey city westin. the trend continued throughout the week  especially at media day  where sherman drew the biggest crowd of players from both teams. wilson did not seem to mind. asked  if he was surprised that sherman had received so much attention in the past week  he replied: no. i mean  hes a great football player. wilson  who also played minor league baseball  continued: all of the things that hes done for our football team  he deserves the attention with the way that he plays. i love that about richard. sherman  laughing and smiling through it all  embraced the attention but also asked for his teammates to be recognized. i think that these cameras could be anywhere  he said. they could be on all my teammates  and they deserve it.  melissa hoppert     6:17 p.m.and the teams are on the field for real   the seahawks are

game time for madison avenue as well as for the n.f.l.  as marketers and agencies get ready for the annual ad bowl inside the super bowl.    more than 50 commercials are planned to appear during the game  from a mix of mainstay super bowl advertisers  among them  anheuser-busch  coca-cola  general motors  godaddy  mars  movie studios and pepsico  and newcomers like beats music  chobani yogurt  jaguar  squarespace and weathertech.     although most of the commercials have been available for viewing before the game  in social media like youtube  there are some that are being kept under wraps until they appear.     for instance  chrysler said late on friday that it would return. the company has garnered considerable attention in recent super bowls for spots with content that surprised viewers like a halftime appeal by clint eastwood.     come back here during the game for comments after each quarter  looking at some highlights and lowlights of the super bowl xlviii spots.  stuart elliott     6:12 p.m.warm up  get ready  and wait   football coaches are notorious creatures of habit  and among those habits is programming every minute leading up to kickoff of a game. the super bowl is where season-long habits go to die. the broncos and the seahawks have been shooed from the field to make room for pregame pageantry  and they will be forced to sit  and sit  and sit  for roughly 30 minutes until the game starts. it is just one thing that makes the super bowl a bit of a different experience for teams. the length of the halftime show is another. we wrote about this a few years ago  when the giants and patriots played in the super bowl. their coaches  tom coughlin and bill belichick  are not known for having the patience of todays coaches  seattles pete carroll and denvers john fox.  john branch     6:13 p.m.the mini-opera we did not see   rene fleming  who will be performing the star-spangled banner in a few minutes  had a vision in her head of bringing dancers with her to the super bowl to turn the national anthem into a live opera on the field. instead  she decided to play it straight and perform with a recording by the new jersey symphony. while people were betting heavily on her going over the standard 1 minute 40 seconds  fleming was mostly concerned about how being amplified would affect her performance. the native of rochester was hardly worried about the cold.  benjamin hoffman     6:05 p.m.clichs are a super bowl tradition too   after broncos receiver eric decker tells fox about how its been a week full of emotion but now its time to play

the city that never sleeps  new york welcomed the super bowl spectacle with open arms. the big game was met with no shortage of big parties  so many in fact that ones that would normally be considered a hot ticket were all of a sudden a lot easier to get into. consider that jay zs roc nation sports party at the 40/40 club on saturday night  attended by the yankees ace c.c. sabathia  a roc nation client  and former and current n.f.l. players like ladainian tomlinson and adrian peterson  was actually overshadowed by the directv party at new yorks pier 40 stadium  hosted by  you guessed it  jay z  with a special appearance by his wife  beyonc. that did not dampen the mood at the 40/40 club  where eagles linebacker mychal kendricks and friends occupied a prime table. mistaken by some as the hip-hop artist chris brown  kendricks relished the attention. even browns ex-girlfriend rihanna sees a resemblance  recently naming kendricks her crush on man crush monday on twitter. other hot tickets were parties held by maxim (including justin bieber misbehaving)  playboy (situated between the intrepid museum and the bud light hotel) and espn (headlined by the singer robin thicke). at the foxsports1 party in the meatpacking district on thursday  aaron paul of breaking bad had his picture snapped with bill murray as the band kings of leon played. the lombardi trophy was also in attendance. even the news media received a party: the n.f.ls media party tuesday at chelsea piers had food stands featuring some of new yorks top restaurants and guest appearances by d.j. questlove of the roots and constantine maroulis of american idol and the broadway show rock of ages.  melissa hoppert     5:51 p.m.live by the app  die by the app   the fans are all charged up. or they were hours

all but one regular-season game because of hip surgery. although he returned for the divisional playoff round  he sustained a concussion that forced him to miss the n.f.c. championship game. despite all of that  look for the seahawks to attempt to establish harvin early as a threat. he can serve as an effective decoy  if not much more.  tom pedulla     5:36 p.m.lets drink responsibly    photo

secaucus  its not the cold  its the humidity   once fans arrived at secaucus on new jersey transit around 2 p.m.  many encountered a nearly hourlong wait  in blistering heat  before passing through a security  checkpoint and reaching their connecting trains to metlife stadium. im going to lose about five pounds  said karin rivale  of aurora  colo.  the floor moist beneath her as fellow travelers began peeling off layers. seahawks and broncos fans joined in cries of a.c. in a plea for a cooler train station. when one group attempted a call-and-response chant of sea! and hawks! a broncos fan  matt budreau  interceded. sea! the fans said. caucus! budreau replied. but as the line stagnated near the station rotunda  he came to regret his endorsement of the city. im reconsidering secaucus  he said  drenched in sweat. they put the b.o. in super bowl. other jeers from the crowd included shouts of t.s.a! and blame christie! (an emergency responder  scanning the crowd for anyone struggling with the conditions  could not conceal a smile at the gubernatorial jab.) around 3 p.m.  the bottleneck appeared to ease at least slightly  in part because personnel stopped checking train tickets immediately after riders cleared security. (they checked at platforms  a new jersey transit spokesman  john durso jr. said.) just feed them through! an officer shouted. durso said that as of 3 p.m.  new jersey transit had carried 13 500 people to the stadium complex. but not every rider got all the way there. attendees were required to show game tickets at secaucus before traveling to the stadium. a sizable number were turned away because they could not produce tickets  durso said  declining to estimate more precisely.  matt flegenheimer     4:17 p.m.calm broncos fans: confidence or experience?    photo  credit bob eckstein    bob

of their sons  all seahawks fans from whippany  n.j. it was very straightforward  tom williams said  adding that it took about 30 minutes. mark lyons and bryan maxwell  who were driving buses

p.m.super bowl week was rockin   super bowl xlviii has been as much about water as it was expected to be about snow. the broncos media availability all week was held aboard the cornucopia majesty  the largest luxury party ship in the northeast at 30 000 square feet. the ship  which was docked outside the jersey city hyatt  where the team was staying  has five dining rooms and can accommodate up to 1 200 guests. peyton manning was not a big fan. i wasnt prepared for this rocking cruise ship  manning said when asked if there had been any holes in his preparation for the game. theres always a wrinkle to keep you on your toes.   another player  safety david bruton  was asked what he thought of the ship on the first night of availability after the teams arrival. i hear its very nice  he said in a nod to the whirlwind that is super bowl week. in addition to the players boat  there was the bud light hotel  a lodging and entertainment site aboard norwegian cruise lines newest ship. the getaway  which holds 4 028 passengers  was docked next to the intrepid sea  air and space museum on the west side of manhattan. there was even a small cruise ship docked next to the taste of the n.f.l.s party with a purpose on saturday at the brooklyn cruise terminal for revelers seeking a change of scenery. the broncos  who as the week wore on seemed to get their sea legs  will now do their best to find their balance on the field at metlife stadium.  melissa hoppert     3:23 p.m.chants and massages begin at penn station   early sunday afternoon  fans attempted to navigate pennsylvania station in new york  approaching new jersey transit workers holding ask me signs. where  one traveler asked  could riders find the connecting trains to metlife stadium once they arrived in secaucus? follow everybody else  an employee said. though winding lines formed beside ticket windows as early as 1 p.m.  many fans said that the first leg of their trip  getting to secaucus  had gone relatively smoothly  despite the swelling crowds. still  visitors appeared to greet penn station itself  long derided by locals  with ambivalence. its functional  said toby anderson  45  a broncos fan from sacramento. as far as the cleanliness  you know  what are you going to do? along platforms and near ticket machines  a series of chants and taunts filled the space: go hawks!  omaha! and  in one clear reach  peyton manning is mediocre at best. other atypical occurrences for the station included fans happily snapping photographs at ticket windows and at least one seahawks supporter massaging the shoulder of a new jersey transit employee. then there were the regular commuters  caught in the undertow of russell wilson jerseys. i have no involvement with the super bowl  ashley glaser  19  a student from park ridge  n.j.  said to a ticket agent. i just want to get home. glaser said in an interview moments later that the scene on st.patricks day had probably been worse. but she cautioned that it was early. no one is too drunk yet  she said.  matt flegenheimer     3:14 p.m.the 12th man settles in    photo  credit bob eckstein       2:57 p.m.seated with time to spare   the main concerns with a new york super bowl were the potential for cold weather and the problems with transporting so many people through the new york metropolitan area. having left manhattan in the first wave of media buses  i was able to get here and through security without any issues. now seated in the auxiliary press box  the massive heating system installed to deal with the weather is so strong that no jacket is needed. so if the hiccups are transportation and weather  the n.f.l. is 2 for 2 so far. the lack of vegetarian meal options will have to be investigated  but otherwise were all systems go. there are not enough fans in the stands to get an idea of whether this crowd will be rooting for denver or seattle  but one thing is clear: against the gray seats of metlife stadium  the orange broncos jerseys show up quite a bit better than the blue and gray seahawks jerseys  so it may end up looking like a broncos home game.  benjamin hoffman     1:30 p.m.security and a sense of humor  maybe   media bus no. 1 was scheduled to leave times square for metlife stadium at 1:15 p.m. it was full by 12:15  a 56-passenger commuter bus packed with reporters and photographers. then came the security check. two police officers and a dog boarded about 12:35 and walked though the bus. the dog looked happy to be working the aisle. i trust dogs more than i trust humans when it comes to that stuff  a radio reporter said. a dogs never going to get lazy. apparently the dog didnt find anything amiss  and having completed their rounds  the dog and the officers left.  youre in lockdown  one of the officers said as he went down the steps past the driver. just kidding. but the driver closed the door and no one has gotten on or off since. departure time remained 1:15.  james barron     1:15

a.m.unzip the parkas  this will be no ice bowl    photo  a security guard had a quiet moment at metlife stadium.credit charlie riedel/associated press   there is an old scandinavian saying that roughly translates to  there is no bad weather  only bad clothing. early last week  it looked as if 80 000 fans in metlife stadium would be testing that theory in real time when the seahawks played the broncos in super bowl xlviii. but having bet on the leagues ability to handle its first cold-weather super bowl  the n.f.l. has seemingly caught a break. the temperature at kickoff is expected to be as high as the mid-40s  falling short of the coldest in super bowl history  a distinction held by super bowl vi in new orleans. it was 39 degrees at tulane stadium when mike clark of the dallas cowboys kicked off to mercury morris of the miami dolphins and 81 023 people watched the cowboys win  24-3. with sundays weather largely taken out of the equation  the fans in the stadium and at home will be free to focus on the matchup of the most productive offense in n.f.l. history and a young defense that already appears to be one of the best ever assembled. as with all super bowls  there have been plenty of subplots to keep people talking. the players were hounded all week  and the consensus from the news media was that richard sherman talked too much  marshawn lynch talked not enough  and peyton manning was just right. along the way  there was enough discussion of macklemore and legalized marijuana to make you occasionally forget that a football game was going to be played. but when the ball kicks off sometime after 6:25 p.m. eastern  the n.f.l. will have its two best teams playing in the nations biggest market  which  before it even starts  has to be considered a huge success.  ben hoffman    even the most ardent fans of the seattle seahawks were likely not predicting super bowl xlviii to be so lopsided. from the flubbed snap on the games first play right up through the fourth quarter  seattle outplayed the denver broncos in every way. a week that was dominated with talk of peyton mannings legacy ended up with one of the most embarrassing losses in super bowl history  and manning was largely responsible for his teams struggles. this super bowl proved a number of things: experience can sometimes be less important than talent; a great defense and a good offense beat a great offense and a mediocre defense; and just because you call something the first cold-weather super bowl does not mean it will actually be cold. metlife stadium proved to be a good site for the actual game  with the main issues centering on the inability to provide adequate public transportation for the 80 000-plus fans in attendance. whether or not there is another outdoor super bowl in a cold-weather city is uncertain. commissioner roger goodell was noncommittal when asked about plans for more. but it would be surprising for the league not to try again after this experiment has seemingly been a huge success. as the few remaining fans (all of whom appear to be seahawks fans) linger in the stadiums lower seats  the n.f.l. season is officially over.  benjamin hoffman apparently all of richard shermans powers of braggadocio were contained in his injured ankle. his postgame comments  even if they were screamed  seem like the words of a much more humble and gracious man than the one the world met after the n.f.c. championship game. we had a lot of hard work  a lot of dedication and the team deserves it  sherman said. russell wilson  earl thomas and kam chancellor  they deserve this. the legion of boom  baby. i hope we etched our names in the history books. this is the no. 1 offense in the history of the n.f.l. and we were able to play a good game against them. peyton manning may go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game  and were just blessed to have an opportunity to play against him. i cant believe it.  benjamin hofffman marshawn lynch was noted for being tight-lipped all week. he kept that up in his press availability after the game. he answered three of the questions with a total of 12 words. but he did open up about not celebrating on the field: man  they know how i feel about it. this is big time. this has been a tradition since i came  since forever. its just what i do. everybody knows it. they respect it. for lynch  that was quite a bit of talking. for his teammate richard sherman  that would barely be enough words to clear his throat.  benjamin hoffman we had bounce-right  counter-right. we were calling for it all week. we knew it was a good chance. we had to put that on film all year  and the guys did a heck of a job blocking. as soon as i caught the ball it was open field.  percy harvin on his 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.  benjamin hoffman  the whistle has blown  the seahawks have won and the ad bowl within super bowl xlviii is over. a quick wrap on the last quarter: 11 spots  by my count  on par with the third quarter  also 11  confirming previous patterns of networks running more spots in the first half than in the second half  as insurance against just the kind of lopsided result there was sunday night. many might say the ad bowl saved the best for last  or at least the most-watched and most-liked before the game for last  in that puppy love spot for budweiser ran in the fourth quarter. it kicked off an all-nice  all-awwwwww  hap  hap  happy commercial pod; it was followed by a cheery song in a godaddy spot and the second of two doritos spots that won a consumer contest  which featured a boy  a dog and a cute ending. (question for the creator of the doritos spot: do kids really still play cowboys  or is that something out of dennis the menace?) another notable ad in the fourth quarter was for sodastream  featuring scarlett johansson. it had a different line from a previous version because fox would not let the company knock coca-cola and pepsi-cola as it wanted to do. (the spot fox would not run was uploaded to youtube  a strategy that sodastream followed last year  too  when cbs rejected a coke/pepsi poke in an ad.)  in an unfortunate juxtaposition  the sodastream spot was preceded by one of three ads for t-mobile; the third t-mobile spot was a plain-looking thing  with only text on screen  and joked that maybe next year t-mobile would run an ad with overpaid movie stars. then came the sodastream spot with ms. johansson. oops! the 11 ads in the fourth quarter  added to 11 in the third  17 in the second and 15 in the first  brings the super bowl xlviii ad count to 54. that is about par for recent ad bowls. looking back across the entire evening  there were some dominant themes and approaches among the spots. patriotic appeals and celebrations of americana were plentiful  in ads for  among others  weathertech  chrysler and coca-cola. as noted in a previous post  the parade of stars was one of the biggest in recent super bowls  with the later quarters adding to the ranks ms. johansson  danica patrick  three cast members of full house  three british actors known for playing bad guys  johnny galecki  richard lewis  bob dylan  bruce willis  laurence fishburne and mandy patinkin. and there was  in general  a sweeter tone to many of the ads compared to previous years when sexy sales pitches  sight gags and sarcasm predominated. to be sure  there were some brands that sought to be daring  like butterfinger with the sex joke in the marriage counselors office. but brands like bank of america  beats music  budweiser   cheerios  chevrolet  coca-cola  doritos  godaddy  honda  microsoft and toyota took a higher road. be sure to come back here on monday  and check the print edition of the new york times  for another look back at all the ads of super bowl xlviii.  stuart elliott an announcement was just made in metlife stadium that anyone hoping to use public transportation should remain inside the stadium until given further instruction. congestion is apparently so bad that the platforms cannot handle the waiting passengers. as the night starts to get colder  the success of the first cold-weather outdoor super bowl could be tarnished if fans are expected to stand around for too long. the line for the train at metlife is really long. #super bowl //t.co/q2a1imlzdc  steve eder (@steveeder) 3 feb 14  benjamin hoffman malcolm smith was named the super bowl most valuable player. the award had gone to an offensive player in 40 of the previous 47 super bowls  but smiths interception and fumble recovery were crucial to the seattle win. all week the teams secondary  known as the legion of boom  got the attention  but it was smith who intercepted a pass to clinch the n.f.c. championship  and once again he came up huge for his team. the third-year player was the 242nd pick in the 2011 draft.  benjamin hoffman there is blue and green confetti everywhere  with plenty of it still floating in the air. my colleague steve eder points out there are cannons full of orange and blue confetti somewhere sitting unused  right?

he said. theres more important stuff in life than football games. and no  he would not say what his last name was. im a family member of a player  he said.  james barron i feel like that budweiser commercial made me want to buy a puppy more than buy budweiser  jacob giesler (@jacobgiesler) 3 feb 14 the most anticipated commercial of the super bowl  and thats because budweiser floated this ad out early last week  and it stars a puppy  finally ran during the two-minute warning. obviously  budweiser was hoping its heartstring-pulling puppy/clydesdale love story would get the most attention this late in the game. and that strategy backfired with a dreadful blowout that has put fans in a coma.  that said  you cant not love this commercial. hate bud. hate commercialism. hate bad super bowls. but you have to love the puppy.    lynn zinser as the confetti was fired from cannons and fell back down onto the players heads  van halen played because a more recent song would just be far too scary. but for seattle  a brand-new team with a young roster  this could be the first celebration of many  and a fresh song would have felt more appropriate.  seattle won this game by sticking to the teams principles and exploiting the weaknesses of a team that until now did not seem to have any flaws. it was a perfect example of playing together to reach a team goal. while some fans left early  undoubtedly trying to avoid the transportation nightmare they experienced getting here  most of the fans made it through a noncompetitive game that at some point started to feel like a commercial for just how good the seahawks are.  every super bowl team has its share of players who suddenly believe they should be paid far more money and leave the team for greener pastures  but this team is filled with lower-round draft picks in their first few seasons  so they should have at least a few more years together to continue to dominate the n.f.l.  benjamin hoffman thats it. a shockingly lopsided super bowl ends with a shockingly lopsided score. the seahawks win their first title  and peyton manning is the bridesmaid again.  the real star of the game was the seattle defense  which produced a safety on the games first play and never let up. the broncos didnt pick up a first down until the second quarter  but lost four turnovers and looked out of sorts all night.  seahawks quarterback russell wilson passed for 208 and 2 touchdowns (both the jermaine kearse) for seattle  but more important avoided the mistakes that haunted denver all night. in addition to mannings two interceptions  the broncos had four fumbles  losing two of them. manning finished with 34 completions (a super bowl record) and 280 yards  but he also threw two interceptions  including a crusher that malcolm smith returned for a touchdown in the second quarter.  adding to his forgettable night: this crushing defeat was mannings 12th postseason loss  the most in n.f.l. history.   andrew das not surprisingly  tarvaris jackson (!) couldnt lead the seahawks into the end zone. so manning will get a couple more plays here and we wind it down. pete carroll  meanwhile  will join jimmy johnson and barry switzer in adding a super bowl ring to an n.c.a.a. football championship. well done. his team was unstoppable today.  andrew das hes waiting just off the field  with his foot in a boot  to join in the celebrations.  andrew das question: can tarvaris jackson call himself a super bowl-winning quarterback after this game? i say yes.  benjamin hoffman manning keeps trying  but at this point hes just padding numbers no ones going to remember. on fourth down he drops back and gets the ball knocked out of his hands by chris clemons as he throws. fumble!!! and of course seattle recovers it at the denver 29. theres 3:44 left and seattle can rub their noses in it if they want.  andrew das  bob eckstein with the seahawks about to win a super bowl for the first time  the list of teams that have never won it all has shrunk to 13. the minnesota vikings  buffalo bills  cincinnati bengals  philadelphia eagles  san diego chargers  atlanta falcons  tennessee titans  carolina panthers and arizona cardinals all came up empty in their super bowl appearances. the cleveland browns  detroit lions  houston texans and jacksonville jaguars have never even had the chance to lose. the browns and lions at least had a life before the super bowl  each winning n.f.l. championships before the creation of the leagues signature event.  seattle will now have championships in football and basketball (seattle supersonics in 1978-79). the rabid sports fans of their city can now focus their attention on getting the mariners and sounders to join the citys champions club.  benjamin hoffman they are disconsolate  the denver broncos fans who have tickets that let them retreat to the huge  heated lexus club at metlife stadium. i cant stand to be outside waiting for my team to show up  said jim grunditsch of vail  colo. i can take three steps and get a painkiller  or stay outside  where seattle fans will wave towels in my ear. what would you do? jamie darvish  wearing a washington redskins jersey  said he too was rooting for denver. he said he had paid $6 000 for a ticket with a face value of $2 500  but he had his reasons for leaving his seat and going inside. its all seattle fans where we are  he said  so i will stay in here. if you had to pick two teams that have the most-chilled fans  it would be these two. oh  that was tough. sorry you missed that touchdown. but still.  james barron      three quarters down  one to go  and already there is mumbling online about the lopsided score and whether advertisers in the second half of the game will regret their ad buys. that is why there historically have been more ads in the first half of a super bowl than in a second. also  the last few games were close until the final whistle  so buying later in the game is not on its face a foolish idea.           in any event  there were by my count 11 national spots in the third quarter  including a biggie from chrysler for the new chrysler 200 with a new theme  americas import  echoing imported from detroit with eminem from a previous big game.           this time  bob dylan replaced eminem and delivered a paean to american manufacturing and detroit that was the second such spot in the game  after weathertech in the second quarter.            and who would have bet that two commercials in a 2014 super bowl would feature mr. dylan  much less two in the same quarter? a chobani ad in the quarter used his song i want you.            (chobani brought another bear  too  after carmax and beats music. poor stephen colbert  he hates them!)          there were many kinder  gentler ads in the third quarter  among them the goldieblox girl power salute  sponsored by intuit; axe peaces paean to love; the heinz ketchup salute to happy; audis pitch for adopting rescue dogs; and a surprise honda spot with bruce willis urging hugs as a proxy for auto safety.          forty-three commercials down  by my count  lets see what the fourth quarter brings.  stuart elliott demaryius thomas has 13 catches and was just targeted by peyton manning for the 17th time. he already holds the super bowl record for receptions  many of them coming against richard sherman  and has been the only thing working for denver. he may not come away with a super bowl ring  but he has had a memorable performance. unfortunately for the broncos  he has been the only thing working on offense all game.  benjamin hoffman manning has 33 completions and demaryius thomas has 13 catches. both are super bowl records. and nobody will care. the broncos turn the ball over on downs. just under 10 minutes left  and if this was a college game the walk-ons would be a getting a run.  andrew das he was helped off a few plays ago  limped behind the bench and now is riding to the locker room on a cart.  and you know what? he doesnt have to say anything today. as muhammad ali famously noted  it aint bragging if you can back it up.  andrew das by my count  after tonight five super bowls will have been decided by 30 points or more. the broncos will have been on the losing end of three of them. update: yup  just checked. thats right: super bowls xxii (vs. redskins)  xxiv (vs. 49ers) and xlviii.  andrew das those denver fans had traveled so far  paid so much and come with such hope. and with a quarterback like peyton manning  some could still believe  even down by 36-8 in the third quarter.  but the truth is  broncos fans have started heading for the exits at metlife stadium. more than one fan wearing a manning no. 18 has been spotted inching toward the door. and it might be their best play of the night  especially for those relying on public transportation on the reverse commute. a bottleneck at secaucus  n.j.  made for a long  tough  journey to the game for some.  while seattles big lead has made for a less competitive game  it might take some pressure off the transit system as the night wears on. broncos fans have seen enough. #letsbeatthecrowds //t.co/zflheeg9mb  steve eder (@steveeder) 3 feb 14  steve eder denver really comes up small after ending the shutout. after recovering an onside kick and taking a penalty  seattle drives 58 yards in five plays  all wilson completions  including a 10-yarder to kearse for the touchdown.  its a slaughter. its bears-patriots. its ravens-giants. its 43-8.  troy aikman on fox: i dont know what denvers doing. none of us do.  andrew das bob dylan 1966: build a fire on main street and shoot it full of holes. dylan 2014: we will build your car.  nicholas thompson (@nxthompson) 3 feb 14 in the endless string of car commercials  it is hard to stand out. one way to do it: get bob dylan to remind you of your patriotic duty to buy american cars. chrysler rolls out the 60s icon to tell you its o.k. to buy asian-built cellphones or drink german beer  but we will build your car. you have to get over the idea that dylan is now selling cars in 2014  and we know not all of you will be able to  but if you can  its pretty effective.   lynn zinser rockies pitchers and catchers report in 13 days.  andrew das //t.co/treodio498  patrick stewart (@sirpatstew) 3 feb 14 no bruce willis are you even watching it  jason kirk (@jasonkirksbn) 3 feb 14 the dreary competitive tone of the game apparently called for a bit of heartwarming stagecraft from madison avenue. so  in comes bruce willis  not usually mr. heartwarming  to tell us to hug all our friends. somehow this was a honda ad. too bad he started by saying  great game  huh? um  no. budweiser came next with a heros welcome for a solder coming home to winter park  fla. was probably a bit over the top  but hey  whos going to criticize for being to sentimental about soldiers? no one.    lynn zinser here come the broncos baby!! well  not really. but manning finds demaryius thomas from 14 yards (really nice catch under pressure  by the way) to spoil the shutout. (that catch was his 12th  a super bowl record  and pushed him over 100 yards for the game. so  um  yay for thomas.) the broncos go for 2  and manning hits welker out of the backfield for the conversion. seahawks 36  broncos 8. theyre just spoiling betting pools now.  andrew das with that touchdown  the broncos are off the hook. they will not be the first super bowl team to be shut out. they are  however  still down by 28.  benjamin hoffman there has never been a shutout in the super bowl  but the lowest score by a losing team came in the last cold-weather super bowl. in super bowl vi the miami dolphins scored just 3 points with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees at tulane stadium in new orleans.  despite the broncos currently losing 36-0 and having possibly the worst ever performance in a super bowl  their fans have stayed remarkably resilient. there are few empty seats  and the color orange is prominent throughout metlife stadium. while some have headed for the exits  the others have just stayed standing in their seats in stunned silence as their teams rocket-fueled offense has looked absolutely pedestrian.  benjamin hoffman if only denver had had a signal early in this game that it wasnt going to be its day .  andrew das the super bowl most valuable player has been a defensive player seven times (in super bowl xii  two cowboys defenders shared the award)  and there is a strong likelihood that malcolm smith will make it eight. his pick-6 was completely demoralizing for the broncos  and his fumble recovery certainly seems to have wrapped things up as denver was moving the ball a little and suddenly was once again without the ball. the last defensive player to win was dexter jackson of the tampa bay buccaneers in super bowl xxxvii. its only too bad for smith that al davis is no longer with us. he loved nothing more than signing super bowl m.v.p.s to ridiculous contracts.  benjamin hoffman russell wilson with a short ball to jermaine kearse at the 23. he spins out of the first tackle  then another  then dodges another bronco. touchdown! yep  thats it everyone.  game. over. 36-0. five broncos had a shot at kearse. all of them missed.  andrew das  bob eckstein peyton manning throws  and only bad things happen  i want to go home.  andrew das manning with a nice midrange ball to demaryius thomas on a run down the seam  and it looks like a big gain at last  until he takes on a defender and fumbles the ball!!!! malcolm smith  of course  scoops it up at the 20 and returns it to his 27.  wah  wah  waaaaaaaaaah.  andrew das malcolm smith has really good timing. an interception to end the n.f.c. championship game  a pick-6 in the super bowl and a fumble recovery in the super bowl. i do not think he will be getting a christmas card from peyton manning.  benjamin hoffman its so much more fun to watch fox when its someone else being blitzed & sacked! #superbowl  hillary clinton (@hillaryclinton) 3 feb 14 hours from now well be asking what car company had a commercial with a weird dog breed. wait  ive already forgot  neil budde (@neilbudde) 3 feb 14 yes  the super bowl has way too many car ads. and yes  most of them are fairly predictable. so  you have to tip your hat to audi for the sheer absurdity of the doberhuahua ad. it was a silly idea that the ad writers took to even sillier lengths. a dog show. attacking guitars. terrorizing a city street. they even get kudos for the tag line  compromise scares us too.    lynn zinser there has never been a super bowl shutout. the lowest total came in miamis 24-3 loss to dallas in super bowl vi  in 1972. its been 13 years since a team failed to reach double digits (ravens 34  giants 7 in 2001.) the broncos  meanwhile  have just punted again. after running a draw play on third-and-10. it lost a yard.  tick  tick  tick   andrew das this seahawks team is outrageously good and is the second-youngest team in the league. they are crushing the greatest regular-season offense in n.f.l. history  and they are not even making it look hard. it really is an embarrassment of riches in the n.f.c. west  where the 49ers could easily be the team running away with a win here and the rams and the cardinals are a lot better than people realize. considering the hard-hitting nature of all four teams  the only thing holding them back in the next few years is how much they beat each other up.  benjamin hoffman  bob eckstein j.c. penney was an early winner in the battle for super bowl viewers attention on twitter. the department store chain tweeted what looked like two drunken tweets from its official corporate account: who kkmew theis was ghiong tob e a baweball ghamle. #lowsscorinh 5_0  jcpenney (@jcpenney) 2 feb 14 toughdown seadawks!! is sseattle going toa runaway wit h this???

  lynn zinser their fans are called the 12th man havent you heard? rt @hochman 12 seconds into the first half  safety. 12 seconds in the second half  td.  ben shpigel (@benshpigel) 3 feb 14 percy harvin takes the second-half kickoff out of the air and takes off  and doesnt stop until hes in the end zone.  87 yards  touchdown!! deferring pays off seattle; the seahawks couldnt have scripted that any better. and its 29-0. ouch.  andrew das heres what golden tate had to say about the return of percy harvin when meeting with reporters this week: im excited to see him. im especially excited to see him back there on kickoff return. if you kick the ball to us  you never know whats going to happen with him. an 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown says tate knows what hes talking about.  benjamin hoffman  bob eckstein the scary thing about how well the seahawks defense played in the first half is that it did so without sacking peyton manning even once. they have limited manning to a passer rating of 46.3 with none of the broncos famous receivers managing even 10 yards a reception. the legion of boom got most of the credit for seattles defensive efficiency this season  but the teams front seven did have the eighth-most sacks in the n.f.l. if cliff avril and company can get to manning in the second half  this could get even uglier than it already is.  benjamin hoffman before the second half starts  take a moment to enjoy this review of rene fleming on the artsbeat blog. with rene fleming  super bowl xlviii gets an operatic opening rene fleming became the first opera singer to perform the national anthem at the super bowl on sunday at metlife stadium in east rutherford  n.j.  but the word opera went unmentioned in her introduction. new jerseys bruce springsteen performed at the halftime show in 2009  the year before his home state was awarded this years game. guessing he still would have done it if asked.  andrew das  the second quarter is done  meaning the first half of the ad bowl inside super bowl xlviii is done  too.       by my count  there were 16 commercials nationally in the second quarter  plus the pepsi spot that ran a moment ago to promote pepsis sponsorship of the halftime show.       three of the spots in the quarter were from advertisers that did not previously raise their hands to say they were buying time on the game: geico  sonos and subway. the geico and subway spots were not new; not sure about the sonos spot. spots not made for the super bowl  or making their debut on the game  are usually less liked than all-new ones  and sure enough  there have been several complaints on twitter already about the geico and subway spots.        other highlights included the following:       * the first of two spots for coca-cola was shown  with a very definitive message about diversity and inclusion  coming as coca-cola is facing protests from activists unhappy that the company  which is also sponsoring the winter games in sochi  russia  has not come out against the russian treatment of gays. in a news release  coca-cola said that it would show a longer version of the spot during the olympics. the multicultural  multiracial cast included a vignette that by my eye was meant to be a same-sex male couple with their daughter.         * weathertech ran its commercial about making its products in america  a topic very much in the news.          * some spots with sweet themes and content were shown  including the toyota highlander spot with the muppets serenade  the volkswagen spot riffing off the line from its a wonderful life about how angels get their wings and of course the coke spot.          the 16 spots in the second quarter  the pepsi spot and the 15 spots in the first quarter total 32 commercials beamed into living rooms and onto second screens nationally.          on to the second half.  stuart elliott i will give bruno mars this: he stuck to his promise to make the performance about his songs. the stage theatrics were minimal and his band put on a good show. it seemed anticlimactic when you consider some of the megastars who preceded him  but he certainly acquitted himself well. and it was a good move by the n.f.l. to embrace a current artist  as the league has often been overly safe. of course  midway through the show the red hot chili peppers came out to sing songs that were popular 20 years ago  so its still baby steps. .@brunomars is killing it. hes still no @jtimberlake  but im with @nailajeanmeyers on this: why not have a current  non-washed-up star?  melissa hoppert (@mhoppertnyt) 3 feb 14  benjamin hoffman before you kill bruno mars as not super bowl quality as a halftime performer  know that up with people did the halftime show four times  and carol channing did it twice.  andrew das 1. eli. 2. archie. 3. olivia. 4. peyton. 5. cooper.  andrew das if the muppets can make a comeback maybe theres a chance for denver.  george nicholson iii (@gnicholson3) 3 feb 14 toyota used a second-quarter ad for the highlander to answer the rhetorical question  is it possible to make a terrible ad starring the muppets?  the answer  unfortunately  is yes. as a band of muppets takes over driving a poor  unsuspecting mans s.u.v.  absolutely no hilarity ensues. in fact  it was painful to watch. even kermit looked pained at the end.   lynn zinser russell wilson: 9 of 14  94 yards  0 interceptions peyton manning: 17 of 23  104 yards  2 interceptions.  anyone else identify the problem? the picks were crushing  sapping momentum and  of course  costing denver 7 points on the smith return. but 17 completions for only 104 yards? thats not nearly good enough for manning. the running games have been negligible: percy harvin is seattles leading rusher  with two carries for 45 yards  but 30 came on one reverse. marshawn lynch has 17 yards on 11 carries  while denvers knowshon moreno has 5 carries for 17.  andrew das they have just turned off the heat lamps in the auxiliary press box for not-beyoncs performance. this is not making me like him more. but im willing to be turned around by a good show. so i hope he studied the black eyed peas performance in dallas and plans to do nothing like that.  benjamin hoffman fox cut away before we could see if one of them stood up and said: hey  how about you stop complaining about us? and stop throwing the ball to the other team while youre at it? and thats the half. maybe the broncos can hug it out in the locker room.  andrew das this game has been a little boring (unless youre a seahawks fan)  and in a few minutes the halftime show is going to star bruno mars  whom i will refer to as not-beyonc. in his news conference on thursday  not-beyonc seemed quite nice  and had very tall hair. but he failed at being beyonc in a way that is hard to describe.  benjamin hoffman manning finds moreno at the 20  but thats short of the first down. denver takes a timeout  then eschews the field goal and goes for it. bad idea. manning  under pressure  underthrows his receiver on the left sideline. so they get nothing.  andrew das you  stephen colbert got robbed! nobody should have their commercials anywhere near david beckham in his underwear.  page (@acarygrantfan) 3 feb 14 stephen colberts debut hawking pistachios had an interesting twist. the first part of the ad was unimpressive  unless you really like birds in fluorescent green ties. but if you hung through the beefcake ad that was david beckham for h&m  you got the payoff. it was so fitting of a colbert bit that you would swear he wrote it. do you think he did?    lynn zinser manning has quietly  and quickly  moved the broncos to the seattle 27  or whats also known as field-goal range. at this point  given the way the half has gone  theyll take anything that gets that goose egg off the scoreboard.  andrew das unless things change rapidly  there will be plenty of jokes at peyton mannings expense after this game. some of the jokes will be deserved  but the truly unfortunate thing is that he will undoubtedly be judged as a failure to the legacy of john elway. that shows a selective memory by broncos fans  as elway won two super bowls  but also lost three  including a 55-10 drubbing at the hands of joe montana and the san francisco 49ers in super bowl xxiv. regardless of the final result  manning is an all-time great. if he were to come back and win a super bowl before retiring  his losses would be forgotten  just as they were for elway.  benjamin hoffman denver keeps the ball.  andrew das the officials give the ball to the seahawks  but a replay sure makes it look as if he was down before the ball was out. there will be a review of the turnover. denver needs this call.  andrew das malcolm smith  with crucial interceptions in consecutive playoff games  had two career interceptions heading into this years playoffs. apparently the third-year player out of southern california only goes for the ball when it really matters.  benjamin hoffman among recent denver broncos quarterbacks  the strongest performer so far tonight is tim tebow  in something of an upset.  ben rothenberg (@benrothenberg) 3 feb 14 when t-mobile announced it had signed tim tebow for a super bowl ad  well  it was going to be worth watching no matter what. the ad used the irony of tebow being out of football perfectly  asking  what can you do with out a contract? part of the answer was find and tackle sasquatch. not bad. t-mobile hopes viewers like tebow better than n.f.l. coaches did.   lynn zinser manning is hit as he throws on third-and-long by orlando franklin  and the resulting duck is plucked out of the air by linebacker malcolm smith. and hes gone  returning it 69 yards for a touchdown!  the only part of the play smith bungled was his spike over the crossbar; after running more than 70 yards  he got only about nine feet high. oh well  they dont take points off the board for style. seattle 22  denver 0.  and the momentum that had been slowly shifting swings closed like a garden gate. wow.  andrew das   and the first quarter of the ad bowl inside the super bowl is complete. three quarters to go  assuming there is no overtime.      there were by my count 15 national commercials in the quarter  including two from the bud light #upforwhatever campaign  much promoted before the game; two from chevrolet  one with a charity component; one of two godaddy spots; another charity-themed ad  from bank of america; the first commercial from chrysler group  for the new maserati; and one of the winners of the annual crash the super bowl contest sponsored by doritos  inviting consumers to create ads.      overall impressions so far are mixed  with a notable  if not uncommon observation: lots of celebrities. three in the bud light spots  ellen degeneres in the beats music spot  john c. reilly supplying the narration in the turbotax spot; john turtorro helping a woman quit her job in the godaddy spot; u2 singing for bank of america; and jeff bridges narrating the hyundai genesis spot.      two charity ads in one quarter also seems to suggest a kinder kind of tone to the super bowl commercials.    stuart elliott malcolm smith stepped right in front of a wobbling pass by peyton manning and took it back for a pick-six. it should be noted that it was smith who was in such fantastic position to catch richard shermans deflection in the n.f.c. championship game that won it for seattle. mannings second interception was an absolute crushing blow for denver.  benjamin hoffman kam chancellor has returned to the game  but denver has continued to show some movement for the first time this game. peyton manning is looking more animated and the denver half of the crowd is waking back up. a score here would certainly be good for helping this game avoid turning into a blowout.  benjamin hoffman with 10:30 left in the first half  knowshon moreno bulls over the right side for denvers first first down of the game. is it the start of something? lets see them get another first. but dont think for a minute that 15 points is enough against peyton manning.  andrew das kam chancellor seemed to be o.k. when walking off the field after being shaken up on a kickoff  but if he is unable to return it is hard to quantify how bad that would be for seattle. one of the absolute keys to seattles style of play is the interaction between chancellor and earl thomas. losing either safety for an extended period would hurt seattle more than losing richard sherman  as hard as that is to believe (especially for richard sherman).  benjamin hoffman seattles kam chancellor  the hard-hitting defensive back  was injured making a tackle on the kickoff after the seahawks touchdown. always a peril when a starter plays on special teams. hes walked off on his own.  andrew das both golden tate and doug baldwin spent the week being asked about the return of percy harvin. while both remained optimistic that harvin would be a huge help to the team  they also could be excused if they wanted some credit for helping get seattle to the super bowl. one thing cited by all of the seahawks was the presence harvin would provide and how that would open things up for the other receivers. so far that seems to be working as baldwin is the teams leading receiver with 3 catches for 50 yards while harvins contributions have come on running plays.  benjamin hoffman  bob eckstein after a pass interference calls gives them a first-and-goal  seattle shifts into beast mode  with marshawn lynch slamming into the line twice and delivering a 1-yard touchdown. the extra point makes it 15-0 three minutes into the second quarter.  youre fooling yourself if you dont think it feels as if it should be a lot more.  andrew das did radio shack just admit they are old and outdated?  ken boxx (@kboxx97) 3 feb 14 radio shack decided to tease the coming redesign of its stores in hilarious fashion. the 80s called. it wants its store back. so  in comes everything from alf to mary lou retton. only possible problem? if you didnt live through the 80s  does any of that strike you as funny?   lynn zinser turnovers and time of possession are often what people look to when trying to decide who will win a game. so far  this one is all seattle. there are many slightly chilly fans wearing orange who are having second thoughts about paying four figures to go to a football game.  benjamin hoffman denver is actually pretty lucky its still a game. if the broncos defense hadnt held seattle to two field goals  theyd be in danger of getting blown out in the next few minutes.  andrew das sometimes omaha means omaha and hurry means hurry. and sometimes  it seems  the offensive linemen of the denver broncos arent sure which is which. that  at least  seemed to be what happened on the first play of the super bowl. quarterback peyton manning stepped toward his linemen to scream instructions when the ball went flying past his head. perhaps center manny ramirez misunderstood the snap count or saw manning move in anticipation of a snap. or perhaps manning was being manning and tried to call a new play based on how seattles defense lined up. manning  after all  is the master of the audible who uses a complex matrix of code words to alert his teammates of new plays while simultaneously deceiving defenses. the system works particularly well when manning plays at home because broncos fans (and colts fans before them) lower their voices so the broncos can hear mannings calls. during a playoff game against the chargers several weeks ago  it was so quiet that microphones near the field picked up manning yelling omaha dozens of times. but at metlife stadium  manning lined up near the seattle end zone where many seahawks fans were sitting. could the 12th man have helped their team score the first 2 points of the game?  ken belson nope. even worse: manning overthrows julius thomas down the middle on third down and the ball lands right in the arms of seattles kam chancellor at the denver 37.  ruh roh.  richard sherman  your thoughts?  are you kidding me?!?! youre going to try to come over the middle with a sorry throw like that! dont you ever throw that ball! thanks  richard. talk later?  andrew das kam chancellor just did his best to lower the boom on wes welker. luckily for welker  chancellors 6-foot-3 frame is simply too tall to get a clean hit on a 5-9 wide receiver. he shot right over him. then chancellor showed his versatility  picking off manning and setting up yet another seattle drive on offense. the seattle secondary is easily looking as good as advertised.  benjamin hoffman wilson finds jermaine kearse in the end zone  but denvers nate irving pops the ball out of his hands  so hauschka comes on for another field goal. seattle now leads  8-0  in the third inning. i mean  first quarter. denver coach john fox used his challenge just before the third-down play  to question whether an incompletion was actually a lateral. (he was wrong.) but the challenge almost seemed as if he was just buying his defense a minute to try to figure out what the heck is going on. to their credit  theyre keeping manning in this game by forcing field goals. but theyve been on the field a lot in the early going.  andrew das the seahawks have now scored three times  and yet peyton manning and the high-powered broncos offense could tie the game with one touchdown and a 2-point conversion. while denver has shown little ability to move the ball against seattle  this game is still wide open. considering how much seattle has appeared to dominate on both sides of the ball  thats truly remarkable..  benjamin hoffman well  turbo tax. good commercial until it turned out to be for turbo tax.  steve hofstetter (@stevehofstetter) 2 feb 14 turbo tax has turned up its ad game for this tax season  with some nice  unusual ads this month  but its first super bowl effort really tested the edges of creativity. since when does a high school prom-looking dance have something to do with online tax filing? not sure i know even after watching it. but they get points for bold.   lynn zinser marshawn lynch has not done much so far (five carries for 6 yards)  but seahawks fans know a runner of lynchs style often takes quite a while to get going. on each play  denver is committing multiple interior players to bringing the big running back down  and over the course of the game those big players tend to wear down. if seattle shows a commitment to giving lynch the ball  hell eventually find holes that are not opening so far.  benjamin hoffman make that 7 of 10 for wilson  for 82 yards  after doug baldwin runs under a beautifully floated pass over champ bailey for a 37-yard gain. first and goal at the 6. and denver cant seem to do anything to stop it.  andrew das russell wilson is 6 for 8 after a short pass to percy harvin  and the broncos cant seem to lay a glove on him. hes had plenty of time in the pocket  but when theres not enough  hes gone. all the broncos can do is chase.  andrew das michael robinson  who just reeled in a 7-yard catch  is useful for many things other than serving as the temporary voice of marshawn lynch (as he did during the seahawks media availabilities). the big fullback was a quarterback and wide receiver during his time at penn state. he is talked about a lot less than derrick coleman  but robinson is a solid football player who contributes to seattle in a number of ways.  benjamin hoffman the broncos go nowhere  a 3-yard run  and passes of 2 and 3 yards  but look at the bright side: at least they didnt go backward. eli manning pulls out his cellphone and texts peytons number. dude  when i won my two super bowls  hes what we did   andrew das so far  bud light and doritos are tied for worst super bowl commercial in 2014  ant (@soulvester) 2 feb 14 the latest doritos ad is always much anticipated in the super bowl  and the first one wasnt a disappointment. it featured a kid-driven time machine that seems to work when dad comes out to discover his son has gotten old  or not. it wasnt worth a belly laugh  but worth a smile.   lynn zinser it should be pointed out as often as possible that knowshon morenos name is a combination of his fathers nickname (knowledge) and his mothers name (varashon).  benjamin hoffman five minutes into the game  hell get to touch the ball for the first time  on denvers second play.  andrew das holding the seahawks to a field goal has to be seen as a victory for the broncos. off to a brutal start in which their one offensive play resulted in 2 points for the seahawks  the broncos now have the ball back and are less than a touchdown behind. as for the cold weather  it is official that super bowl vi will keep its title as the coldest super bowl on record. at kickoff it was a balmy 49 degrees  or 10 degrees warmer than the broncos and the dolphins had way back when.  benjamin hoffman carroll was wrong  and itll cost him a timeout. a penalty pushes the seahawks back as they line up to kick  but steven hauschka laughs at your extra 5 yards  hahaha!  and bangs the kick from 31. seattle 5  denver 0 with 10:21 left in the first quarter.  if you thought that 5 you drew in your super bowl squares was never going to happen  things may be looking up for you.  andrew das its really easy to forget about russell wilson as a runner. the seahawks offense is focused so heavily on marshawn lynch that wilson flies under the radar in terms of his ability to scramble and do planned runs. but that speed  which he used to set up a fourth-and-1 (seattle challenged the play but the call on the field stood)  is a weapon not only on a broken play  but also to give him time to throw. denvers defense is nothing special  and chasing wilson all day will wear out their front seven.  benjamin hoffman seattle gets to denvers 14  but on third-and-6 russell wilson keeps the ball and rolls left  diving for the first-down marker. he ends up a yard short though  so seattle will have to settle for a field goal. but hold on  pete carroll is challenging the spot? replays show hes wasting his time.  andrew das 6 000-1 safety on first play. think about that.  matt hayes  (@matt_hayessn) 2 feb 14 how much do you believe in momentum? the seahawks were gifted a 2-0 lead on a bad snap (the resulting safety was the fastest score in super bowl history) and percy harvin  who had all of one catch this season  just reeled off a huge run. with the seahawks now in the red zone  the broncos have immediately been put on their heels  and if seattle can score on this possession denver will have quite a hole to climb out of.  benjamin hoffman after the penalty forces a short kickoff  seattle safely navigates a first down and then hands to percy harvin on a reverse. only a step out of bounds after a 30-yard gain prevents a touchdown.  denver appears to be on mountain time still. better get the engine firing soon  because seattle is flying.  andrew das after the broncos trindon holliday runs the kickoff back to only the 14  peyton manning steps up to change the play on first down as his center  manny ramirez  snaps the ball over his head.  the broncos knowshon moreno covers it in the end zone  but thats a safety. (they actually had a penalty on the play too  so  you know  great job guys.) seattle 2  denver 0 after 12 seconds.  andrew das so much talk this week centered on experience. peyton manning  the most experienced man on the field  just flubbed a snap that resulted in a safety and a 2-0 lead for seattle. so i guess maybe experience isnt everything?  benjamin hoffman seattle has elected to have its defense on the field to start the game. that makes sense considering the legion of boom is undoubtedly excited to get  booming. receiving the ball to start the second half will be nice as well. if only matt hasselbeck  the former seahawks quarterback  had been there to declare  we want the ball and were going to score! as he did after winning a coin toss before overtime in 2004. of course  the seahawks lost that game.  benjamin hoffman but only after the referee almost steals joe namaths thunder by flipping the coin himself. i guess the players arent the only ones with nerves. seattle will kick off. enjoy the game.  andrew das untrue super bowl fact no. 1: a team led onto the field by a woman on a white horse has never lost the super bowl.  andrew das there was one thing that could unite broncos and seahawks fans on sunday: public transportation. as fans wearing both teams colors spilled into metlife stadium  a number were sharing tales of a horrible commute to the game. it was those who took trains from manhattan through secaucus who seemed to have gotten the worst of it. there  fans described a scene where it was hot  they guessed that it was over 95 degrees. they said they saw people fainting. some said people were urinating as they waited in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. it was an epic fail  said joe knittel  32  of seattle  after he spent four hours making his way to the game from manhattan  finally arriving about an hour before kickoff. even after making it through secaucus  he and his friends said they waited in a long line to enter the stadium. that  too  they said was problematic  as fans lining up outside the security screening tents freely cut in front of each other as busloads of people arrived  prompting arguing and shouting.  steve eder  bob eckstein seattle cornerback richard shermans postgame rant to the fox reporter erin andrews after the n.f.c. championship game  shortly after he made a critical defensive play that helped the seahawks reach super bowl xlviii  instantly catapulted him into the national spotlight. on the first day of player availability  shortly after the seahawks touched down in new york  sherman was surrounded by television cameras and reporters  about 20 people deep. meanwhile  the seahawks young star quarterback  russell wilson  had about only 20 people total lingering around his podium at the jersey city westin. the trend continued throughout the week  especially at media day  where sherman drew the biggest crowd of players from both teams. wilson did not seem to mind. asked  if he was surprised that sherman had received so much attention in the past week  he replied: no. i mean  hes a great football player. wilson  who also played minor league baseball  continued: all of the things that hes done for our football team  he deserves the attention with the way that he plays. i love that about richard. sherman  laughing and smiling through it all  embraced the attention but also asked for his teammates to be recognized. i think that these cameras could be anywhere  he said. they could be on all my teammates  and they deserve it.  melissa hoppert the seahawks are introduced first  and the boos that greet them give a sense of how the crowd is leaning. the broncos run out next  to cheers. all expect for peyton manning  who walks on water. i kid. the broncos follow a white charger onto the field. very cool. the seahawks only had their 12th man flag. advantage: broncos.  andrew das  it is almost game time for madison avenue as well as for the n.f.l.  as marketers and agencies get ready for the annual ad bowl inside the super bowl.    more than 50 commercials are planned to appear during the game  from a mix of mainstay super bowl advertisers  among them  anheuser-busch  coca-cola  general motors  godaddy  mars  movie studios and pepsico  and newcomers like beats music  chobani yogurt  jaguar  squarespace and weathertech.     although most of the commercials have been available for viewing before the game  in social media like youtube  there are some that are being kept under wraps until they appear.     for instance  chrysler said late on friday that it would return. the company has garnered considerable attention in recent super bowls for spots with content that surprised viewers like a halftime appeal by clint eastwood.     come back here during the game for comments after each quarter  looking at some highlights and lowlights of the super bowl xlviii spots.  stuart elliott football coaches are notorious creatures of habit  and among those habits is programming every minute leading up to kickoff of a game. the super bowl is where season-long habits go to die. the broncos and the seahawks have been shooed from the field to make room for pregame pageantry  and they will be forced to sit  and sit  and sit  for roughly 30 minutes until the game starts. it is just one thing that makes the super bowl a bit of a different experience for teams. the length of the halftime show is another. we wrote about this a few years ago  when the giants and patriots played in the super bowl. their coaches  tom coughlin and bill belichick  are not known for having the patience of todays coaches  seattles pete carroll and denvers john fox.  john branch rene fleming  who will be performing the star-spangled banner in a few minutes  had a vision in her head of bringing dancers with her to the super bowl to turn the national anthem into a live opera on the field. instead  she decided to play it straight and perform with a recording by the new jersey symphony. while people were betting heavily on her going over the standard 1 minute 40 seconds  fleming was mostly concerned about how being amplified would affect her performance. the native of rochester was hardly worried about the cold.  benjamin hoffman after broncos receiver eric decker tells fox about how its been a week full of emotion but now its time to play some football  richard shermans not looking so bad anymore  is he? usually you have to wait until after the game to ignore insight like that.  andrew das known as the city that never sleeps  new york welcomed the super bowl spectacle with open arms. the big game was met with no shortage of big parties  so many in fact that ones that would normally be considered a hot ticket were all of a sudden a lot easier to get into. consider that jay zs roc nation sports party at the 40/40 club on saturday night  attended by the yankees ace c.c. sabathia  a roc nation client  and former and current n.f.l. players like ladainian tomlinson and adrian peterson  was actually overshadowed by the directv party at new yorks pier 40 stadium  hosted by  you guessed it  jay z  with a special appearance by his wife  beyonc. that did not dampen the mood at the 40/40 club  where eagles linebacker mychal kendricks and friends occupied a prime table. mistaken by some as the hip-hop artist chris brown  kendricks relished the attention. even browns ex-girlfriend rihanna sees a resemblance  recently naming kendricks her crush on man crush monday on twitter. other hot tickets were parties held by maxim (including justin bieber misbehaving)  playboy (situated between the intrepid museum and the bud light hotel) and espn (headlined by the singer robin thicke). at the foxsports1 party in the meatpacking district on thursday  aaron paul of breaking bad had his picture snapped with bill murray as the band kings of leon played. the lombardi trophy was also in attendance. even the news media received a party: the n.f.ls media party tuesday at chelsea piers had food stands featuring some of new yorks top restaurants and guest appearances by d.j. questlove of the roots and constantine maroulis of american idol and the broadway show rock of ages.  melissa hoppert the fans are all charged up. or they were hours ago. now some of them are discovering that their cellphones are running low  and they are desperate to find a charger. it took forever to get here  said jordan springer of mercer island  wash.  who said he had downloaded a transit app on his apple iphone before he boarded the train from manhattan. he talked to people in seattle on the way to metlife stadium. and i was taking pictures  which i sent  he said. gerard smith of garden city  n.y.  borrowed a charger from a reporter in the auxiliary press box when he realized his iphone was also close to death. i was taking a thousand pictures the moment i walked in  he said  adding that he was thinking about finding a phone with longer battery life. but that will have to wait until after the game.  james barron youd have to go back 15 super bowls to find a qb who made less than russell wilson ($526 217). in 1999  kurt warner made $250k.  darren rovell (@darrenrovell) 2 feb 14 foxs jimmy johnson just said that if peyton manning wins today  he will be in the discussion as the greatest [quarterback] of all time. really jimmy? get out much? because that conversations been going on for years  and i routinely hear manning mentioned in it.  andrew das seattle wide receiver percy harvin missed all but one regular-season game because of hip surgery. although he returned for the divisional playoff round  he sustained a concussion that forced him to miss the n.f.c. championship game. despite all of that  look for the seahawks to attempt to establish harvin early as a threat. he can serve as an effective decoy  if not much more.  tom pedulla the official inactive lists for the game were just distributed to the news media.  seahawks: bryan walters  wr; christine michael  rb; michael bowie  t; caylin hauptmann  t; kellen davis  te; benson mayowa  de; jordan hill  dt. broncos: zac dysert  qb; ronnie hillman  rb; quentin jammer  cb; vinston painter  t; chris kuper  g; joel dreesen  te; sione fuo  dt.  benjamin hoffman a few players from both teams just ran onto the field. if their reception was any indication of how this game is going to go crowd-wise  this place is hugely pro-broncos. richard sherman led out the seahawks players to a mix of cheers and boos  but when a few broncos players came out the stadium erupted. the crowd will be the only familiar thing for denver  as the stadium sits roughly 5 273 feet lower elevation-wise than mile high stadium.  benjamin hoffman so who predicted it would be 54 degrees in east rutherford today? #superbowl //t.co/ckutb2jjke  steve eder (@steveeder) 2 feb 14  steve eder on sunday  super bowl boulevard  an open-air football festival that one f.b.i. official called a street fair on steroids  was all but gone. the wildly popular toboggan ride was stowed away on a trailer ready to be hauled away  and new york city sanitation trucks worked to polish broadway from 34th street to 47th street as vendors sold official super bowl xlviii programs. many of the temporary news media studios remained. outside macys  a hub for all things super bowl  fans lingered around espns set in herald square. all week espn anchors had to compete with a booming light and sound show set that transformed the department stores iconic facade into an outdoor theater. the 10-minute video  which had nine daily shows  dazzled fans  even if it also strained their necks. inside the store  an n.f.l. pop-up shop  a 36 000-square-foot space on the fourth floor  was a popular destination. already picked over by the weekend  the new york-new jersey super bowl merchandise was among the most popular items.   photo  the light show on the facade of macys.credit melissa hoppert/the new york times    melissa hoppert   melissa hoppert  bob eckstein in a sea of peyton manning and marshawn lynch jerseys at metlife stadium  there have been more than a few throwbacks to the earlier eras of both teams. from john elway to terrell davis to steve largent  the fans are showing their loyalties in various ways.  benjamin hoffman russell wilson  seattles second-year quarterback  said thursday  the last day players were made available to the news media  that it would help him that the seahawks played at metlife stadium earlier this season. they blanked the giants  23-0  on dec. 15. russell said he visualizes success before each game and knowledge of the stadium enhances those mental images. i believe in making sure my mind is ready to go  he said.  tom pedulla and we have a sighting of a fan wearing shorts at the cold weather super bowl. //t.co/3suvepfu2r  benjamin hoffman (@benhoffmannyt) 2 feb 14  benjamin hoffman once fans arrived at secaucus on new jersey transit around 2 p.m.  many encountered a nearly hourlong wait  in blistering heat  before passing through a security  checkpoint and reaching their connecting trains to metlife stadium. im going to lose about five pounds  said karin rivale  of aurora  colo.  the floor moist beneath her as fellow travelers began peeling off layers. seahawks and broncos fans joined in cries of a.c. in a plea for a cooler train station. when one group attempted a call-and-response chant of sea! and hawks! a broncos fan  matt budreau  interceded. sea! the fans said. caucus! budreau replied. but as the line stagnated near the station rotunda  he came to regret his endorsement of the city. im reconsidering secaucus  he said  drenched in sweat. they put the b.o. in super bowl. other jeers from the crowd included shouts of t.s.a! and blame christie! (an emergency responder  scanning the crowd for anyone struggling with the conditions  could not conceal a smile at the gubernatorial jab.) around 3 p.m.  the bottleneck appeared to ease at least slightly  in part because personnel stopped checking train tickets immediately after riders cleared security. (they checked at platforms  a new jersey transit spokesman  john durso jr. said.) just feed them through! an officer shouted. durso said that as of 3 p.m.  new jersey transit had carried 13 500 people to the stadium complex. but not every rider got all the way there. attendees were required to show game tickets at secaucus before traveling to the stadium. a sizable number were turned away because they could not produce tickets  durso said  declining to estimate more precisely.  matt flegenheimer  bob eckstein bubba  a handsome 9-year-old golden labrador retriever  and his handler  inspector amanda mostek  were among those working to keep the super bowl safe. mostek presented their business card after bubba joined other canines in inspecting bags carried by the news media that typically contain laptops  media guides and  in this case  late-night snacks.  tom pedulla  benjamin hoffman for those who came very early and by car  van or bus to metlife stadium  it was a pretty smooth commute. we were expecting it to take an hour  but it only took 20 minutes  said gene wickes  61  of vail  colo  who joined a group van with his son  freddy wickes  24  from midtown manhattan to get to new jersey.  the wickeses were among the early arrivals to the stadium  getting here just before 2 p.m. when the gates opened. they were hoping to take part in some of the pregame festivities.  it was a similarly easy trip for tom and lori williams  who piled into an s.u.v. with three of their sons  all seahawks fans from whippany  n.j. it was very straightforward  tom williams said  adding that it took about 30 minutes. mark lyons and bryan maxwell  who were driving buses chartered by stub hub  were among the first to pull in near stadium entry pavilion 2. it was really smooth  believe it or not  said lyons  48. im impressed it went as smoothly as it did. it feels secure. it feels efficient. the drivers now must wait for the game to end  and their fingers are crossed that the second half of their work day will be as easy as the first.  steve eder super bowl xlviii has been as much about water as it was expected to be about snow. the broncos media availability all week was held aboard the cornucopia majesty  the largest luxury party ship in the northeast at 30 000 square feet. the ship  which was docked outside the jersey city hyatt  where the team was staying  has five dining rooms and can accommodate up to 1 200 guests. peyton manning was not a big fan. i wasnt prepared for this rocking cruise ship  manning said when asked if there had been any holes in his preparation for the game. theres always a wrinkle to keep you on your toes.   another player  safety david bruton  was asked what he thought of the ship on the first night of availability after the teams arrival. i hear its very nice  he said in a nod to the whirlwind that is super bowl week. in addition to the players boat  there was the bud light hotel  a lodging and entertainment site aboard norwegian cruise lines newest ship. the getaway  which holds 4 028 passengers  was docked next to the intrepid sea  air and space museum on the west side of manhattan. there was even a small cruise ship docked next to the taste of the n.f.l.s party with a purpose on saturday at the brooklyn cruise terminal for revelers seeking a change of scenery. the broncos  who as the week wore on seemed to get their sea legs  will now do their best to find their balance on the field at metlife stadium.  melissa hoppert early sunday afternoon  fans attempted to navigate pennsylvania station in new york  approaching new jersey transit workers holding ask me signs. where  one traveler asked  could riders find the connecting trains to metlife stadium once they arrived in secaucus? follow everybody else  an employee said. though winding lines formed beside ticket windows as early as 1 p.m.  many fans said that the first leg of their trip  getting to secaucus  had gone relatively smoothly  despite the swelling crowds. still  visitors appeared to greet penn station itself  long derided by locals  with ambivalence. its functional  said toby anderson  45  a broncos fan from sacramento. as far as the cleanliness  you know  what are you going to do? along platforms and near ticket machines  a series of chants and taunts filled the space: go hawks!  omaha! and  in one clear reach  peyton manning is mediocre at best. other atypical occurrences for the station included fans happily snapping photographs at ticket windows and at least one seahawks supporter massaging the shoulder of a new jersey transit employee. then there were the regular commuters  caught in the undertow of russell wilson jerseys. i have no involvement with the super bowl  ashley glaser  19  a student from park ridge  n.j.  said to a ticket agent. i just want to get home. glaser said in an interview moments later that the scene on st.patricks day had probably been worse. but she cautioned that it was early. no one is too drunk yet  she said.  matt flegenheimer the main concerns with a new york super bowl were the potential for cold weather and the problems with transporting so many people through the new york metropolitan area. having left manhattan in the first wave of media buses  i was able to get here and through security without any issues. now seated in the auxiliary press box  the massive heating system installed to deal with the weather is so strong that no jacket is needed. so if the hiccups are transportation and weather  the n.f.l. is 2 for 2 so far. the lack of vegetarian meal options will have to be investigated  but otherwise were all systems go. there are not enough fans in the stands to get an idea of whether this crowd will be rooting for denver or seattle  but one thing is clear: against the gray seats of metlife stadium  the orange broncos jerseys show up quite a bit better than the blue and gray seahawks jerseys  so it may end up looking like a broncos home game.  benjamin hoffman media bus no. 1 was scheduled to leave times square for metlife stadium at 1:15 p.m. it was full by 12:15  a 56-passenger commuter bus packed with reporters and photographers. then came the security check. two police officers and a dog boarded about 12:35 and walked though the bus. the dog looked happy to be working the aisle. i trust dogs more than i trust humans when it comes to that stuff  a radio reporter said. a dogs never going to get lazy. apparently the dog didnt find anything amiss  and having completed their rounds  the dog and the officers left.  youre in lockdown  one of the officers said as he went down the steps past the driver. just kidding. but the driver closed the door and no one has gotten on or off since. departure time remained 1:15.  james barron i got a chance to take in the atmosphere of super bowl week from a couple of locations.   bob eckstein there is an old scandinavian saying that roughly translates to  there is no bad weather  only bad clothing. early last week  it looked as if 80 000 fans in metlife stadium would be testing that theory in real time when the seahawks played the broncos in super bowl xlviii. but having bet on the leagues ability to handle its first cold-weather super bowl  the n.f.l. has seemingly caught a break. the temperature at kickoff is expected to be as high as the mid-40s  falling short of the coldest in super bowl history  a distinction held by super bowl vi in new orleans. it was 39 degrees at tulane stadium when mike clark of the dallas cowboys kicked off to mercury morris of the miami dolphins and 81 023 people watched the cowboys win  24-3. with sundays weather largely taken out of the equation  the fans in the stadium and at home will be free to focus on the matchup of the most productive offense in n.f.l. history and a young defense that already appears to be one of the best ever assembled. as with all super bowls  there have been plenty of subplots to keep people talking. the players were hounded all week  and the consensus from the news media was that richard sherman talked too much  marshawn lynch talked not enough  and peyton manning was just right. along the way  there was enough discussion of macklemore and legalized marijuana to make you occasionally forget that a football game was going to be played. but when the ball kicks off sometime after 6:25 p.m. eastern  the n.f.l. will have its two best teams playing in the nations biggest market  which  before it even starts  has to be considered a huge success.  ben hoffman advertisement 
sports,on broadway in manhattan this morning you could not miss them  a big blue surge of spectators lining the streets. thousands of fans turned out to see the new york giants  fresh from a superbowl win on sunday  march victoriously through the canyon of heroes in lower manhattan. but as the players were feted with a ticker-tape parade  some iraq veterans were asking: why not us? in an article published in tuesdays newspaper  kate taylor talked to some of the advocates for a veterans parade  including paul rieckhoff  founder and executive director of iraq and afghanistan veterans of america. everybody recognizes that the giants deserve a parade  he said. but  he added  if a football team gets a parade  shouldnt our veterans? but mayor michael r. bloomberg of new york has cited the pentagons own advice as the reason for not holding a veterans parade. the argument goes that it is not appropriate to hold a parade while american soldiers are still fighting in afghanistan. the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america have taken their challenge of that logic directly to the pentagon  via twitter: .@pentagonpressec whats stopping america from having two parades to honor our returning iraq and afghanistan #vets? #askdod @deptofdefense  iava (@iava) february 6  2012  so far  there is no response on twitter from the george little (@pentagonpressec)  the pentagon press secretary. iava asked the question during a first ever dod twitter town hall according to mr. little. the department of defense recently posted that answers to some of the questions are coming later today.  today well respond to a few of the questions from yesterdays twitter town hall where we can offer specific resources or #s #askdod  u.s. dept of defense (@deptofdefense) february 7  2012  you can find more chatter on twitter on the issue happening right now. at war is a reported blog from afghanistan  pakistan  iraq and other conflicts in the post-9/11 era. the new york times's award-winning team provides insight  and answers questions   about combatants on the faultlines  and civilians caught in the middle. the new york times has established an education fund for the children of sultan munadi  an afghan journalist who was slain in afghanistan in 2009. learn more about him and how you can contribute here.      marine corps captain calum rammhe  a longtime marathon runner  ran seven marathons on seven continents in seven days to raise money for a charity that supports wounded marines and their families. it also let him reflect on why running is more than a hobby for him. readmore     a physical therapist describes the powerful bonds she formed with the wounded veterans and her fellow physical and occupational therapists at the walter reed army medical center. readmore     a former marine corps officer argues that good leadership makes all the difference in smoothing the integration of women into combat units. readmore     hundreds of letters from an army private named harold grove moss  whose tour of duty spanned pearl harbor to the surrender of japan  have been transcribed and posted online by his daughter. readmore     a vietnam-era veteran says presidential candidates should not be judged harshly just because they did not serve during that war. readmore follow advertisement

sports, gay men of a certain age have strong feelings about broadway divas  who modeled an outsize swagger in an era when they themselves couldnt. of all the give-em-heck floorboard belters in this particular canon  few have attained the sainted status of carol channing  the blond-mopped  lisping hello dolly icon who turns 93 next week with her stage brio intact. when she was helped onstage last night at town hall for a special birthday tribute  grinning widely and wearing a white boucl jacket and slacks  the cavernous house  packed mostly with middle-aged and older gay men  jumped to its feet and  for 10 minutes straight  released the sort of primal roar that might have accompanied a winning superbowl pass. channing was then gently and wittily interviewed by justin vivian bond  the downtown cabaret personality  in a repeat performance of a production staged by the famed promoter daniel nardicio last summer on fire island. their rapport last night was warm  with much spontaneous hand-holding  and when channing early on referred to bond  who is transgender  as he  she corrected herself with admirable swiftness. riffing on a childhood tale of channings  in which a cousin asked her where she wanted to be buried  bond put the question to her again. right between the curran and geary theaters in san francisco  answered channing  who grew up there. theres a fire escape  but theyll have to take that down  she cracked  bringing down the house for the first of many times. to which bond rejoined: you might need that fire escape  depending on which direction youre going.  channing drew laughs when she noted that once  in a carol channing drag lookalike contest  i came in third. she sang two songs  one an old southern folk song her father taught her  the other a sophie tucker ode to gambling. finally  movingly  she performed her keynote monologue from hello dolly  in which she asks the spirit of her beloved late husband  ephraim levi  to let me go! so that she might fully rejoin the living. a misty-eyed  audience-wide sing-along to hello dolly and then happy birthday followed. more than once  channing rose gingerly from her seat to stretch her arms toward the crowd  as though to embrace everyone present. her appearance last night was preceded by a song set from bond  who  in an emilio pucci dress and sleek updo  had buffed away most of the hilariously jagged edges of kiki and herb  bonds former stage act  and emerged  in the performers words  as an aspirational white woman of elegance. an otherwise languorous rendition of burt bacharachs the look of love was broken up by a deranged monologue about the 1960s french singer claudine longets alleged murder of her pro-skier boyfriend. that bit felt just arcane and bizarro enough to remind bond followers of the singers roots without distracting from an evening meant to celebrate channing  a showgirl whose nuttiness was too shrewdly honed to ever be classified as camp. 
sports,advertisement    david pogue     state of the art feb. 9  2011  you might think that this column is about groupon.com  the white-hot web site whose coupons save you 50 to 90 percent at local businesses. but its not. its about psychology. each day  groupon offers for sale a deep-discount coupon from a business in your town. it might be a $25 coupon that buys you a $50 bike tune-up  or a $40 coupon for a $90 massage  or $25 for $100 worth of fitness classes. the coupons arent actually distributed until a critical mass of people (50  for example) have clicked buy. after all  shopkeepers cant afford discounts that steep unless theres something in it for them. if not enough people express interest  the deal dies. no coupons are issued  and nobodys out a cent. groupon is  therefore  a huge win-win-win. you save eyebrow-raising amounts of money. local businesses pick up a landslide of new customers overnight without doing a lick of marketing on their own (a phoenix aquarium  for example  sold 10 000 tickets in 24 hours). and groupon collects half the money from those coupons. no wonder it became profitable after only seven months. advertisement now  this concept  internet-organized group buying  has been tried many times before. remember mobshop? mercata? letsbuyit? they all worked  in principle  the same way. advertisement but groupon is suddenly everywhere you look  in the headlines  on facebook  in dinnertime conversations. the company says that it operates in 175 north american cities and 500 overseas  has 54 million members and has saved them $1.6 billion so far. in fact  groupon is the fastest-growing web company in history  having attained a $1.5 billion value in only 18 months. (on the other hand  not all of the dinnertime conversation about groupon is positive. the companys superbowl tv ads last weekend backfired. one seemed to belittle the oppression of tibetans under chinese rule  the people of tibet are in trouble. their very culture is in jeopardy. but they still whip up an amazing fish curry! and struck many viewers as juvenile and insensitive.) frankly  i couldnt understand the big deal about groupon. why is it such a superstar when so many competitors labor in obscurity? the answer: clever psychology. first of all  groupons sales staff tries to cultivate deals that suit the audience in each city. if youre in san francisco  you get offers for segway tours of vineyards  flying lessons and skateboarding gear. in new york city  youre more likely to see huge discounts on music lessons  theater tickets and interesting restaurants. in most cities  youre likely to spot lots of deals for spas and cosmetic surgery  which hints at the upscale female customers who constitute groupons biggest buyers. in suburban connecticut  where i live  i saw offers like $10 for $20 worth of italian food at a restaurant nearby  $15 for $30 worth of dry cleaning  and $10 for $20 worth of goods at barnes & noble. since thats all stuff id buy anyway  i took the plunge. i bought the barnes & noble coupon and the restaurant coupon. a few hours later  i received my coupons by e-mail. they pointed out that i could avoid printing the coupons if i used the free groupon app for iphone or android phones. at the bookstore  i picked out a couple of books totaling $23. i showed my phone to the cashier  who had been trained to enter the groupon codes. i was the ninth person that day to cash in. advertisement i paid the $3 overage  and that was it. i loved it. id just gotten $10 worth of books free. it almost felt as if id shoplifted. more psychology  of course. its absurd that i should have felt so giddy. i mean  is saving $10 such a landmark event? the last time you bought a house  a car or even a night at a hotel  did you haggle for another $10 off? you probably could have gotten it. but you didnt. somehow  though  in the groupon context  it feels like a steal. theres something about the simple phrase  $10 for $20 worth of stuff that gets you.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. furthermore  your coupon is good for anything in the store. its not the same as a half-off sale  where the store chooses what goods to discount. that tipping point business  the minimum number of takers an offer has to have before it becomes valid  is part of the psychology  too. sure  this element was created to protect the merchants interests. but lets face it  the tipping-point requirement adds a certain thrill to the proceedings. youre invested in the outcome. even the scarcity of deals  one each day  plays on your feelings. it adds to that sense of exclusivity and of serendipity. so does the groupon editors whimsical description of each deal. (a beloved book is like an old friend: full of familiar stories  rich in endearing details and just as enjoyable when covered in highlighter  began the barnes & noble coupon. make a new literary acquaintance with todays groupon.) finally  groupon also seems to be extraordinarily free of red tape and clutter. the fine print is labeled the fine print in a big bold font  and theres not much to it: usually just an expiration date and limit one per person. in truth  there is more fine print. but it describes the whole concept  not any one particular deal. a few things can go wrong. advertisement the biggest gotcha is that expiration date. oh  its plenty generous  usually six months to a year. but you know how people are with coupons; we forget them. we lose them. once again  groupon has built psychology into its business model. every time someone forgets to use the coupon  thats free money for groupon and the merchant. some twitterites complained that groupons overwhelming something-for-nothing appeal persuades them to buy things theyre not actually interested in. (kind of hard to blame groupon for that one.) then theres the groupon effect. groupon lore is rife with stories of small businesses swamped by the response  a yoga studio  family photographer or helicopter-ride outfit getting 1 000 calls a day  for example. that kind of overload isnt a win-win-win; its a mess. (groupon now encourages susceptible small businesses to set a maximum number of coupons for each deal.) finally  the occasional deal goes wrong. when i asked my twitter followers (im @pogue) about their groupon experiences  most  both customers and merchants  were ebullient. but a few reported flawed transactions  shelves picked clean by groupon hordes and businesses that had gone under since the coupon was offered. (groupon issues prompt refunds in that case.) but never mind all that; this internet trend is on fire. groupon imitators are everywhere. for example  livingsocial  groupons closest competitor  is in 175 cities and says it has 20 million members who have saved $300 million. its also offers sub-services dedicated to deals for family activities and fixed-price travel getaways. then theres buywithme (12 cities; you have a week to buy rather than a day); bloomspot (eight cities  several offers a week); crowdsavings.com (six cities  no tipping point); giltcity (six cities; luxury stuff like restaurants  spas  museums  galleries; no tipping point); jasmere (price goes down the more people buy in). that doesnt even count weforia  coupme  groop swoop  groupalia  townhog  teamgrab  agenzy  dailyq  tippr  woot  ideeli and ewinwin. like groupon  most give you financial kickbacks for roping your friends into getting involved. these group-buying sites represent an effective  no-strings blessing in tough economic times. you really should try them. theres very little risk  and an enormous upside: the triumphant feeling of having gotten something for nothing. and now  if you dont mind  i have to wrap this up. im off to order $50 worth of italian food that i bought for $25. the state of the art column on thursday  about internet-organized  group buying  misspelled the name of a defunct predecessor to the  popular current site groupon. it was called mercata  not mercato. e-mail: pogue@nytimes.com a version of this article appears in print on february 10  2011  on page b1 of the new york edition with the headline: psyched to buy  in groups.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
sports,for much of the last year  the republican candidates for president have hammered president obamas handling of the middle east peace effort  hoping to drive a wedge between mr. obama and jewish voters and other supporters of israel over the issue of israels security. now  the rising tensions over irans nuclear ambitions  and the growing possibility of an israeli-led strike on irans facilities that could come as early as this summer  has once again brought the issue of israel to the forefront of the presidential campaign. the white house announced on monday that mr. obama would host prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel at the white house early next month. the meeting comes amid reports that the united states is cautioning israel against launching a strike. a statement from the white house said the visit was part of the continuous and intensive dialogue between the united states and israel and reflects our unshakeable commitment to israels security. mr. obama dispatched his national security adviser to israel over the last several days to discuss the iranian situation and other issues. but mr. obamas republican rivals are likely to try to use the white house meeting on march 5  which comes on the day before the super tuesday primaries  to renew their attacks on an administration they say has not done enough to help protect and support israel. mitt romney has called irans nuclear ambitions mr. obamas greatest failing and said during a debate in new hampshire last month that the president did not do what was necessary to get iran to be dissuaded from their nuclear folly. rick santorum has accused mr. obama of acting naively and cavalierly about irans potential for nuclear weapons  saying on his web site that if barack obama has taught us anything  its that experience matters. and newt gingrich said at a stop in california recently that he supported israels right to undertake an operation designed to dramatically slow down or disrupt the iranian nuclear system. those pledges of support for israel and criticisms of the president on his handling of iran are likely to become ever more strident as the republican candidates look for ways to criticize mr. obamas foreign policy. the presidents support for the war in afghanistan  his carefully managed withdrawal of troops in iraq and his successful killing of dozens of terrorists  including osama bin laden  have robbed republicans of some of their usual critiques. now  republicans appear eager to use the administrations wariness of an israeli strike on iran to paint mr. obama as a reluctant supporter of israels security. mr. obama won more than three-quarters of the jewish vote in 2008  according to exit polls  but republicans hope that attacks on his support of israel could both appeal to jewish voters  a small but important constituency  especially in some swing states  like florida  and to other voters who are committed to protecting israel. in an op-ed article in the wall street journal last year  mr. romney accused the president of appeasing the iranians and said that weve been offered a case study in botched diplomacy and its potentially horrific costs. advisers to mr. obama strongly reject the criticism. they note that the administration has sent israel more money for its security than ever before. and they say the united states has led a robust effort to pressure and isolate iran with sanctions imposed by a broad coalition of countries. the presidents political advisers say they expect attacks from republicans to intensify  especially after the party nominates a challenger to mr. obama. but they say efforts by republicans to play partisan games with the issue of israels security is dangerous given the delicate circumstances surrounding the iranian nuclear program. they do it for partisan political purposes. but the unfortunate consequence may be that iran mistakenly believes the republican attacks and concludes that israel is more vulnerable than it actually is  said robert wexler  a former democratic member of congress from florida and the president of the daniel abraham center for middle east peace. white house officials have not been shy about saying publicly what they are warning privately  that an attack by israel on irans nuclear facilities would be a difficult and dangerous endeavor. in an interview on cnn over the weekend   the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  gen. martin e. dempsey  said that an israeli strike would be destabilizing. but the administration rejects the idea that their military caution is a reflection of a lack of commitment to israels security or its future. i will say that we have closer military and intelligence consultation between our two countries than weve ever had  mr. obama said during an interview with nbc before the superbowl this month. we are going to be sure that we work in lockstep as we proceed to try to solve this  hopefully diplomatically. mr. wexler said the president had been far more aggressive toward iran than previous administrations and that the sanctions by the united states  the european union and other allies were having a major effect on the country  including a devaluing of the iranian currency by half.  the partisan criticism that the republicans offer is bankrupt  mr. wexler said. i almost laughed when the presidents critics tried to suggest a degree of weakness. mr. obamas upcoming meeting with mr. netanyahu will provide a new opportunity to assess the relationship between the two men  which has been rocky in the past. they clashed over the issue of israeli settlement construction during one of their first meetings. and mr. obama was caught telling the french president: i have to deal with him even more often than you. still  mr. netanyahu has publicly praised mr. obama  and israels defense minister  ehud barak  said in december that the unshakable bonds between israel and america and their respective defense establishments under the guiding hand of president barack obama are stronger and deeper than ever. that kind of praise is unlikely to be enough to satisfy republicans on the campaign trail or on capitol hill. the subject of irans nuclear program  and israels plans  is sure to come up at the republican debate in arizona on wednesday  and the candidates have shown little hesitance at turning the potential crisis into a campaign issue. less clear is whether jewish voters in the united states  who also have concerns that go beyond israels security situation  will respond to the republican

sports,updated 6:52 pm confirming google is running ad to promote its brand during the super bowl  over the weekend  the tech blogosphere was abuzz over the expectation that google  a company that build its brand almost entirely through word of mouth  was going to air an ad during the super bowl. john battelle  the author of the search  the 2005 book about google  wrote on his blog that google plans to hit the branded advertising big leagues this sunday  citing an unnamed source.   sometime later  eric schmidt  the chief executive of google  posted the following message on twitter: cant wait to watch the superbowl tomorrow. be sure to watch the ads in the 3rd quarter (someone said hell has indeed frozen over.)  a person familiar with the matter confirmed that google was scheduled to run a spot in the third quarter.  no official word from google yet  and a google spokesman did not immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment.  a super bowl ad would be quite a departure for google. the company  which makes more money from advertising than any media company in the world  is hardly traditional when it comes to its own advertising. the company spends plenty on online advertising. but most of those ads are the kind of utilitarian ads intended to get people to click on a link to learn about a specific product or service  like its adwords advertising system  its digital maps or its new nexus one mobile phone. google has also dipped its toes in television advertising  with a series of clips promoting the chrome browser.  but the company  which famously says that ads are information  has shunned brand messages. perhaps now that google is ramping up its own display advertising business  it feels that it needs to be a player in brand advertising as well.  it is not clear what ad google may air. mr. battelle said it would be one of the search stories ads that the company created last year and has been showing online. that ad  which has already had plenty of spoofs  including this one poking fun at tiger woods  was produced by googles in-house mini-agency. others speculate it may be an ad for the nexus one.  there are no indications that the super bowl ad will be the beginning of a broader marketing campaign.  follow advertisement 
sports,steve jobs and jeff bezos may be rivals in the music sales business  but between them they have forced the music industry to abandon digital rights managementthe software that limits how you copy songs you buy and download.  apple began the assault last february  with a letter by steve jobs arguing that d.r.m. should be eliminated. ultimately emi  one of the major music labels  agreed to sell its music without restrictions through itunes. in the fall  amazon opened a download store selling music in unrestricted mp3 format from emi  universal and a bunch of independent labels. warner music said it would start selling unrestricted music last month.  and today  businessweek reports that sony bmg  the fourth major label will also drop d.r.m. a sony bmg spokesman declined all comment on the topic. but its easy to see that it may well find itself in an untenable position as the lone d.r.m. holdout.  there are two events that may press the labels to change d.r.m. policies. first amazon and pepsi are preparing to do a huge giveaway of digital downloads in a contest tied to the superbowl.  steve jobs will make his annual presentation at the macworld expo  which might be a great time for him to announce that all the music sold by itunes will be d.r.m. free.  edgar bronfman  the chief executive of warner music  wrote an interesting memo to his employees explaining the change of heart. he would have preferred if apple  microsoft and other technology companies agreed on a single format for digital rights management. that would allow customers to buy restricted songs from  say  itunes  and move them later to a microsoft zune. with mr. jobs opposed to this approach  selling unprotected music is a vastly simple way to offer the same experience (or better).  theres even greater pressure  of course  from the business itself. nielsen soundscan  a market research service  said today that sales of cds and other physical music media fell by 15 percent in 2007. sales of digital tracks rose  by  45 percent.  eliminating d.r.m. wont save the music industry  but it will eliminate one objection to paying for downloads. comments are no longer being accepted. and as music has gone  hopefully so will go video.  but probably not in my lifetime.  as the number of hoops we have to jump through to play music goes down  the number of hoops on the video side just goes up and up. music companies mostly dont understand: people will pay for the convenience of downloading easily and quickly  but will not pay for the actual content. this  apple understands.  look at how easy it is to use the itunes music store. 99 cents is just the right price for the convenience of getting the music you want  rather than borrowing a cd from a friend  or stealing a digital file from the internet or somewhere else. its the convenience  and the music publishers will have to adjust (painfully) their business models to match. i hope the music majors (besides emi) will permit apple to sell drm free music:  so far they have been using drm to created a pro-amazon playing field  hoping that there will be real competition to itunes.   id love nothing better better than having drm free  256 kbit aac  being sold across the board on itunes  certainly my music purchases would go up greatly  finally regret free impulse buying will be possible. i just hope the music industry makes it possible for me to give them more of my money. the issue has never been about content  its about who controls distribution.  the major labels want to control the distribution channels and they have been stuck in the old pattern of doing business.  had they made music available drm free 10 years ago  napster and file sharing would never have gained a foothold and they would be making more money. its the classic case of the old model using the law to hinder development of a new and more profitable business model. it was videos and video rental that saved the movie industry despite their attempts to block the sale of vcrs.  plus ca change the record companies have gone completely nuts. first of all  they created the whole napster phenomenon by being asleep at the switch as the capabilities of the digital world were born. now that digital delivery is killing physical delivery  they want to enhance the marketability of their digital content by making adding a new feature: making it easier for the consumer to engage in intellectual property conspiracy  i.e.  aiding and abetting their (the consumers) friends in the theft of the drm-free song!! now thats just brilliant!!  i suspect a few years from now  the labels (assuming they are not all bankrupt) will see the error of their ways and band together to promulgate one drm system and implement it. as a songwriter who makes a living from my intellectual propertymy songs  i am tired of being ripped off by a world of consumers that dont seem to understand that copying cds and giving them away or peer-to-peer sharing of songs constitutes theft and im disgusted with the record labels stupidity and bungling with respect to drm and the protection of my intellectual property!!

sports,bonnie hammers attention to detail and programming instincts at nbcuniversal networks like usa has made her possibly the most important executive in cable television  bill carter writes  and a critical piece of comcasts takeover of the company last year. in her career  she identified bob vila as a host  taught vince mcmahon how to build story arcs into wrestling and made usa a powerhouse with shows like royal pains and burn notice. yet the job she really wanted  turning out nbcs dismal primetime  somehow has escaped her. mr. carter writes: but at a lunch with the then-chief nbc executive  jeff zucker  ms. hammer had been prepared to discuss the possibilities  perhaps suggesting she could commute to the job. mr. zucker did not offer it. there was a bit of fear that usa is making so much money we have to protect it  ms. hammer said. in the 1980s  eddie murphy filled movie houses with his comedy shows like raw. last week  louis c.k. decided to go direct with his fans: no

tell them everything. just let it all get out there. so thats what i have been doing  at least so far. stuart elliott offers his perspective on the best and worst ads of the year. his conclusion: both winners and losers featured celebrities. on the plus side is chryslers ode to the american automotive industry featuring the detroit native eminem. on the other side of the ledger is the faux-bronx stylings of jennifer lopez and the disastrous groupon superbowl ad with celebrities mocking their own charitable impulses. the joke  such as it was  fell as flat as a groupon discount coupon for 1 percent off the price of a super bowl spot  and the campaign was discontinued days later  mr. elliott writes. an unexpected winner in cable television  brian stelter writes  is the history channel  which has turned only faintly historical shows like pawn stars and american pickers into ratings gold. the final ratings for 2011 will show that history  a unit of a+e networks  attracted more middle-aged men than any other cable channel except espn  he writes. next up is a medieval jousting tournament and a scripted show hatfield and mccoys. apple has increased its efforts to impress media executives with its television service apple tv  according to an article in the wall street journal. part of the companys pitch  write jessica e. vascellaro and sam schechner  is that company is applying some of its talent for interfaces and consumer behavior to the traditional activity of watching television. in at least one meeting  apple described future television technology that would

sports,advertisement dec. 22  2007  interview with sergei minaev  november 12  2007 q: you do this every time  go clubbing in moscow when  frederic beigbeder [the french writer] visits? a: yes. weve been doing this for five years already. its some kind of never-ending story. in paris we do more civilized things sometimes. we had fun  but its already hard on my health. chronic lack of sleep. q: im sorry we didnt make it into the nightclub. a: thats idiotic moscow face control. you understand  we dont have a head on our shoulders. everyone is playing at studio 54. they all think that if you do this  if you put 28 brutes at the door and one idiot in charge of face control  then youll immediately be like ian schrager and steve rubell  and youll immediately have studio 54 and all the stars. but thats not the case. the popularity of a club is made by people and atmosphere. moscow clubs are a tale unto themselves  completely a tale unto themselves. morrisey has a great song  glamorous glue. its exactly about this. i love morrissey. where is the woman you like  where is the man you respect. thats exactly about moscow. london is dead  london is dead. you just have to change it to moscow is dead  moscow is dead  and it will be exactly the same. advertisement q: so what you write about in the book  that was earlier in your life? a: yes  i had a period when i was 24-28 years old. i was part of a heavy scene that began friday evening and as a rule ended on monday morning. this was about age 24-27. now  i dont go out except for exceptional cases  like when frederic is here  then we go out. now  we get together at home and talk  the same format as in kitchens in the 1980s. thats much more pleasant because youre surrounded only by those people whom you like. theres none of that showing off. its completely peaceful. advertisement only the interiors  and just slightly the dialogues. in principle everything remains the same on this scene. and of course foreigners go wild in moscow. they immediately go crazy. q: beigbeders book is about that  isnt it? a: its a total reflection of moscow through the eyes of a foreigner in 2007. they go crazy because theres a sea of money here. everything is permissible. they call this true freedom  but true freedom does not consist of buying relatively inexpensive prostitutes and cocaine and snorting it in public places. this is not a sign of true freedom. i think under pol pot in kampuchea  some members of society could also easily use narcotics and buy women for the night. no one speaks of there being true freedom there. q: well what about georgia  where you predicted conflict between moscow and georgia? how did you come up with that? a: everything in georgia is happening very logically  because this so-called revolution  of carnations  or roses  some revolution happened there. what next? next you have to justify some credit of trust allocated to you by the electorate. if nothing is happening on the economic front  in terms of life improving  then you have to quickly find enemies. first internal enemies appear. its enough to imprison them or expel them from the country. then problems begin with abkhazia and adjacent states. naturally  when your neighbor is russia  this infringes on your interests. doubtless  some point of conflict will appear. they just didnt translate media sapiens for [georgian president mikheil] saakashvili. i had two helicopters  but in reality there were two planes. it was as if they copied half of the book. in my view  politics has turned into something thats half a miss something or other competition  and the superbowl. once every four years the electorate has to be entertained  so that it would go and vote. advertisement q: you mean politics in general? a: of course. its a big farce  a big vaudeville  because the person of the 21st century is lazy and  generally speaking  obtuse. everything that is done around us  starting with restaurants  we are brought beautiful bread  everything is served beautifully. everything has to be beautiful. that is the motto of the 21st century. every person who is in a major corporation  major politicians  showbusinessmen  they all appear on screen with just one phrase: let me entertain you. everyone wants to be entertained. thats why everything turns into such show business. i dont see any difference between a gala concert of stars of the 1970s and [political] debates. the former lip-synch from year to year  the latter from cycle to cycle give the same promises  which clearly wont be fulfilled  and they constantly repeat them. q: but youre participating in the campaign somehow right now  in the za putina [for putin] web site? a: yes  yes. my close friend kostya rykov is running on the united russia ticket. im supporting my friend. for me these relations are much more important than all of politicians and show business  thats to begin with. secondly  indeed i see no alternative to putin right now  thats true. q: and you speak about this on the video on the za putina site? a: no  i speak of completely other things. of the fact that its all become a vaudeville. i didnt call on anyone to go to the ballot boxes and vote for us. i just said what i think. q: that things are bad and there are no options? a: its not just that there are no options. putin is the only competent politician who has appeared here in the last 16 years. i became disenchanted with our so-called opposition forces a long time ago. i understood that they are a shadow cast by a lamp on the wall. you cant tell them apart. its enough to look at the most recent events  when two young men  this was pure media sapiens  two young men set themselves on fire in front of cameras. the firemen and ambulances were standing there so they wouldnt burn seriously. this is all like kindergarten. this is all like kindergarten. advertisement q: can you talk about how you were a successful entrepreneur and decided to write? a: im in the wine business  a partnership in one of the three largest wine [distribution] companies in moscow. and about five years ago i started to write in the internet  just for fun  because i had to entertain myself somehow. i started to write a column for burzhyazny zhurnal (bourgeois magazine). it became very popular. and then  at some point  i began to write a book  and it was so spontaneous  it was so spontaneous that i wrote it very quickly. i wrote it in six months. then i teased it out for three months  goofed around really. but there was no goal. no one was thinking of a bestseller or anything like that. no. i think that the product  that is the book  coincided well with the time  with good distribution. all the factors somehow fell into place. we sold the screen rights to dukhless for a record sum for this market. the film hasnt been made yet because there are big problems with the screenplay. right now i remain in the wine business. i write. and ive opened a publishing house. were readying projects for launch. im trying to be a good publisher  to meet with people  talk with them. im an author myself. i know what its like to walk through those corridors and the bastion of editors. every editor has his or her one taste. i dont exclude the possibility that if bret easton ellis came to a russian publisher with his american psycho  he would be told  how awful  we wont publish this. right now im concentrating on publishing. theres some kind of explosion of media activity around me right now. im tired of giving interviews. thats why im not coming out with anything now. my next book will be in january. the tyolki. the chicks. its an amusing story. its about a gossip writer  a typical moscow character  whos romancing three girls at once  dreams of putting out a disc of his own rap group and so forth. a person whos constantly living in a net that he created himself  like most moscow characters. ill finish it now. i have two chapters left. and then ill continue writing a book that i thought up a year ago. about the future  in which that which weve been expecting for so long will finally happen: international corporations will merge with the authorities. you know the famous phrase that politics is just a shadow that business casts on society. its about a totalitarian society. completely morally degraded on the one hand and completely puritan fundamentalist from the television screens. its a classical model. from the television screens they preach family values  then they go have sex with 14-year-olds and snort cocaine. thats what will happen in the future. and we have it now. in the future i think it will be. but the books not about that. the book is about how a little man is chewed up by the system  when he understands that this system and youre not even a screw but some kind of speck of dust how the system grounds people up and how you personally can fight this to cut your losses. q: all your books are a bit about this. dukhless  too. the protagonist works in a corporation. a: the main conflict is always inside the hero. its not outside. its always inside. you can do some awful things  or not. advertisement but its always your choice  and the conflict is always in your own head. and its the same thing with the system. any social institution in which the state dominates you can replace this with a corporate institution this is a system. you either lead the system or you enter it and go with the flow and become a cog. if you dont lead it and youd dont go with the flow but start to resist  it pushes you into an asocial niche. thats why things are very good now. you dont need gulags anymore. you dont need auschwitzs. if someone protests  theyre immediately given a television show  theyre stuck in a marginal niche and told sit there. and people like this. people like the negative. they like aggression. if we listen to a radio show  i know as a host with six months experience  as soon as you start to attack listeners and start to argue with them on the air  and argue in such a way that you refute their words  to attack their dignity  theres a flood of calls. people are ready to call in order to get a portion of ugliness addressed towards them. society is getting stupider by the minute. did you see the last simpsons  the movie? theres a brilliant scene where the mayor comes out and says our city has won the title of dirtiest city of america. theres a pause  and then a guy starts to chant springfield! how else can you explain this? its like borat  which is not a movie about kazakhstan. i love cohen. nazarbayev should give cohen a medal for promoting kazakhstan. i was invited to a conference in kazakhstan about two years ago on international  interregional ties. i said i would come if cohen is invited and i speak together with him. mankind is getting rapidly stupider. were not advancing anywhere  were only falling behind. we have i-phones already  wireless internet  virtual sex  but were getting stupider and stupider.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. there was a poll on the streets of moscow. boys and girls up to 23 years of age  about the soviet union. they say it was cool  the komsomol  pioneers. then theyre asked: did you know you couldnt leave the country? get outta here?! this was on television. to the following question  about concentration camps and millions of people dying there in 1937  the answer is: come on! its revolting. people dont want to grow at all. russia has a persistent myth. were a country of mythologies  that the population of the ussr read more and that now people read less. but everyone forgets that when i was a 13-year-old kid  i had to read a lot because there was nothing else to do. either play soccer or read hugo because you dont have a 24-hour sports channel  or cartoons  those things our children have  no computer. thats for one. i remember apartments of the 1980s very well  where books were the best gift. all of the shelves were stuffed  classics  back to back. they were never read  they were decoration. so  it was a myth that people read more. advertisement q: many accuse you of taking themes from beigbeder and what he wrote resembles your writing. a: yes  but beigbeder also been accused of copying bret easton ellis. thats understandable. when youre writing about the same world you cant have different epitaphs. and you simply cant describe all this crassness and abomination in any other way. the thing is that among russian literary critics its customary to elevate losers to a cult and exaggerate completely insignificant things. so  a successful project will not elicit anything but negative comments from them. there was a very funny story. the first print-run of dukhless was 8 000 copies. and they began to speak of me as a promising writer. critics spoke of me as promising. when the print-run reached 50 000 they tried to find a mass of contradictions and accuse me of imitation. when it crossed 100 000 they called me waste paper. so  you understand  if i had remained at 8 000  i would probably immediately be an unrecognized cult writer. they get very irritated that i dont go to literary gatherings and bow down to their talent  and i quite openly and aggressively criticize them. they tried to accuse media sapiens of being ordered by the kremlin  but when the second volume came out they immediately quieted down. before that they tried to write that nothing like that is happening  that such manipulations dont occur  that its childs play  that no one uses such methods. then we see georgia. then we see all these soldiers being presented as political candidates. its clear that the first who yells stop thief! at a train station is the thief. q: are you planning to seek out new talent? a: seek out is a serious term. when i wrote on my blog that im starting a publishing house  i was sent 95 manuscripts. i simply had to choose from them. i chose five. i found some totally brilliant young people from the internet. of course  ill build some relations with known authors too. but the main goal is to pull up young writers who are shuttling around publishing houses. young authors come. girls and boys. a girl came and said  critique my manuscript. i said  im not a censor  not a critic. i cant write anything. why do you need this  why did you write a book? she looked at me like a complete idiot. what do you mean  why? if the print-run is big  i can get on television  get my own show right away. i dream of writing a pseudo-autobiography with the kitschiest possible name  like star  about a writer who falls for everything i was smart enough to avoid  such as hosting corporate parties  festivals. they pay well for that. appearing on idiotic tv shows  such as glamorous interviews. i was smart enough to avoid this. i want to write a book about someone who was swept away by all this. and about relations with publishers. this is really funny too. young authors whove been around publishing houses say the publishers look and say  what have you got here? you write like minaev  but you dont mention enough music  or have enough cursing or drugs. you need to add it all. i needed a scene with marijuana in order to show how a person goes mad. not to show that people should use heroin or smoke marijuana. god forbid. advertisement q: but theres a lot of cocaine in dukhless. a: of course  because cocaine is snorted by the ton in moscow. and when im accused of this  i say  look  this is like writing about the life of a prostitute without using the word condom. are we writing the truth or not? ive cut back on back on participation in literary talk shows. because this is horrific. the people who were sitting there  they were driving me crazy. the editor of knizhnoye obozrenie  a certain gavrilov  was there  and the famous writer yuri polyakov. and when they started to talk about popular literature and serious literature  gavrilov looked askew at me  as if everyone was supposed to attack me. polyakov was asked who he likes among young writers  and he said minaev  he gave a super impression of an era. and everyone immediately laughed. [there was a 26-year-old boy who said in all seriousness: i write in such a way so that 300 years from now i wont be ashamed. will he come back in 300 years to check? there were mad female critics who said you cannot approach literature by a gender peg. its not a literary term. what is this gender peg? mad people  who fell out of everywhere  who play at being this literary elite. this is horrible. and whats characteristic  they allow themselves to make totally nasty comments about the audience. the publics taste...well theyll always prefer baltika beer to a good bottle of french wine. i said: guys  you cant talk like that in a country where the average salary is $200 a month and a bottle of good wine costs $50. if the mass consumer was standing next to you  he would smash your face in. and he would be right. because this pseudo-snobbism  when you earn $100 for a column and think youre kings  its goes as far as your apartment  all this unjustified showing off. ive determined the formula of modern moscow society. fake pathos is present at all levels. salespeople in stores show off to each other with their new cell phones. clerks with their cars  men their women. literary critics show off with absurd verbal twists. the level of showing off  of pathos  is just off the scale. if this showing of could be exchanged for money wed all be millionaires. theres no one in moscow who doesnt show off. some just have nothing to show off. everything turns in an instant into pathos. this is horrible. only here and in new york and in maybe in london do you have people who earn $1 000 and buy themselves phones for $1 200  on credit. advertisement for example  the market in counterfeit watches here is huge. clerks with salaries of $1500 wear on their wrists watches the originals of which cost $25 000. it doesnt even cross their minds that people who know watches will never believe that these are real. if we actually reach the point thanks to nanotechnologies when we will be able to clone people  all of the oligarchs will quickly clone themselves madonna  eva herzigova  i dont know what other famous models  will immediately clone them and say this is the real kate moss. this is very funny. q: you write about what happens to women in this society  which is so full of pathos and glamour. a: i describe this in one phrase. you know  before women with the help of their genitalia took cities. now they take cars. everything is being devalued. i love you  has turned into the analogue of the american phrase  whats up? it doesnt mean anything. or how are you? when an american says how are you? to you  he has no interest in finding out how you really are. its just an introduction. thats what i love you has become. filler. the word has completely devalued  because feelings have devalued  and its clear it cant be any other. if ten years ago we could think in categories of people against brands  like naomi klein  now people are together with brands  because people and brands have received equal rights to life. its not clear which is more important  you or what youre wearing. most likely the latter. in what city in the world can you imagine an advertising banner that says the following: attention: such and such a beauty salon. best price on botox  150 rubles per injection. if a person comes here  he will immediately understand that there are three popular things here. you must have botox  against wrinkles. the most popular things are botox  sushi and bentley. thats all. three things. in many restaurants sushi has become the russian national food. cantinetta has good italian food. but many italian restaurants have sushi. where else can you imagine this? if theres a strip bar  it immediately becomes a whorehouse. im amazed cocaine isnt sold in pharmacies here yet. the crisis of the hero in dukhless was my crisis  of course. i was deeply depressed. literature is also a collective psychoanalyst. we are people cut in half. we were born v sovke  then in the 1990s they drastically changed everything. they said  ok  now were watching another channel. were not watching this one anymore. they said forget about all the heroes  forget about the entire cultural heritage  forget about everything. weve changed the picture. now survive. its like throwing house pets into the forest. and naturally those who survived lived through a lot  and thats why now theyre being broken. theres a huge stratum of people who didnt notice that anything changed. they simply moved from kitchens into clubs and spent all these years in a haze  and now theyve woken up to find its 1984 again. advertisement q: you were entered college in the early 1990s? in 1992. at the russian state university for the humanities  the historical archives faculty. im a historian. i defended my diploma on the gorbachev era. my specialty was modern history. i wrote several works. on the irish republican army  on ivan the terribles oprichnina  and in particular i closely studied the history of the third reich. im still convinced that from the point of view of mass propaganda and advertising theres been nothing new since the time of goebbels. he didnt have television. he had only radio  but he and molotov put on such a show. he is absolutely the founder of modern propaganda  and advertising too. the modern world is absolutely fascist. we live in the thrall of standards. men must look like this  this and this. women must look like this  this and this. all who are not within these bounds must strive for them  or be losers. thats a completely fascist doctrine. im surprised there arent people standing with rulers outside nightclubs and measuring the distance between peoples ears. probably they will be soon  and that will be right in this situation. all of modern consumer society is  without a doubt  is profoundly fascist. you can see this by africa. people have problems finding drinking water. but you can always find coca-cola. how is this possible? i studied the history of the third reich. i found incredible facts. its clear that the soviet union of those years and fascist germany were twins. its no secret for anyone. but the fact that in the contemporary situation  all of these speeches  all of these propaganda approaches  in one way or another serve as the template for the speeches of many politicians. the direct speech of goebbels is incredibly modern  just change radio to television and no problem. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,trending on twitter in germany monday morning  right up there with the #superbowl and new york giants  was grss gott  roughly translated as  gods greetings  and traditionally the way bavarians and other southern germans  and most austrians  greet one another. the greeting has the nation buzzing after the director in a middle school in the southern city of passau posted a notice banning the more casual hallo from the premises in favor of grss gott  which she considers to be more polite. (the casual german expression for bye  tschss has also been jettisoned in favor of  the more traditional auf wiedersehen.) petra seibert  the director of the st. nikola middle school  argues in the sddeutsche zeitung that the move is an effort to restore a culture of politeness to the school culture that is lacking among pupils. she also says it will help instill a habit that will be advantageous in dealings with future employers. no punishments are handed down to pupils who violate the ban. teachers are simply encouraged to politely remind them to use a more polite greeting  which could be a guten tag  for anyone who does not feel comfortable with the traditional bavarian greeting. at my own childrens school in berlin  the principal would be happy to hear children singing out hallo! in the morning  as she has been bemoaning the fact that neither parents nor pupils greet their teachers anymore. more than once  ive had german parents brush me off when i urge my kids to say please or thank you  to them  telling me not to bother  that it is not important. while the twitter debate has focused heavily on the religious implications associated with grss gott  ms. seibert insists that she is just doing her job by teaching her pupils a level of respect that was previously self-evident  but today is problematic.  what has been your experience of germans  are they exceptionally rude? do you require your children to greet their teachers every morning? follow advertisement 
sports,advertisement by dave itzkoffmarch 26  2006  one rainy afternoon last summer  12-year-old annie ballaine was doing what comes naturally to preteens on days when neither school nor sunshine is readily available: she was soaking up as much television as possible. flipping through the channels  she came across the sight of a chubby  excitable boy of indeterminate age  dressed in a red plaid shirt and blue jeans  profusely thanking a pizza delivery man who had arrived at his apartment with a large cheese pie that contained  the boy claimed  a missing sneaker he had lost five months ago. it was then that miss ballaine  now a sixth grader at st. ann's school in brooklyn  became a fan of "the andy milonakis show." and while she may not be familiar yet with terms like "surreal " "absurdist" and "dadaesque " she could sense that there was a quality about this program -- and especially about its energetic  diminutive star -- that she had never seen on television before. "it was really unusual what he did " she said. "he was doing things that other people wouldn't do to be funny." miss ballaine is not part of the target demographic for "the andy milonakis show " an offbeat  rapid-fire comedy series aimed primarily at males in their late teens and early 20's (and which has its second season premiere on mtv2 this friday). but like many other members of her generation who both secretly and openly admire the program  and who have assimilated its nonsensical repertory of punch lines and satirical rap songs as if it were a second language  she doesn't need anyone to explain to her what's so funny about an adult (if not quite a grown-up) who looks and behaves like a kid. as most of his intended viewers already know  mr. milonakis  a native of mt. kisco  n.y.  is not actually a child. he turned 30 in january. but he has a growth hormone condition that is responsible for his baby-faced appearance. advertisement what science cannot as easily explain is how mr. milonakis has been able to preserve his youthful curiosity well into adulthood  and channel it into skits -- some as short as a few seconds and none longer than a few minutes -- that seem to originate from a mischievous child's fascination with the world around him: what would happen if i tried to inflate a twinkie with a bicycle pump? if i put a battery in my mouth  will my face light up like a pinball table? is toothpaste an appropriate ingredient for a sandwich? advertisement even mr. milonakis  who cites experimental comedy series like "monty python's flying circus" and "mr. show with bob and david" as his influences  is not entirely sure where his hyperactive sensibility comes from. "i like a lot of crazy comedy " he said  speaking from the grand street apartment that serves as both the set and production offices of "the andy milonakis show." "but when it comes to creating it  i don't know why i do what i do. i tend to go for the really weird  bizarre stuff. i actually have to tone it down for the show." "weird" is by far the most versatile and frequently employed word in mr. milonakis's vocabulary; it is weird to him that when he writes a scene that calls for a talking pizza  he now has a team of artists and designers at his disposal that will build one to his specifications. "they're like: 'should it have pepperoni eyes or salami eyes? should its mouth be one big sardine or a can of sardines?' " mr. milonakis said. "i'm like  'it's not rocket science.' " and it is weird to mr. milonakis that he should find himself the star and the creative force of a hit cable series  when just four years ago he had no television credits at all. "there are thousands and thousands of people who are out there  killing themselves to read one line in a commercial " he said. "i'm lucky that i skipped a lot of that heartache and everyday struggle." like several other breakthrough personalities of recent months  mr. milonakis got his head start on the internet. while working as a computer technician  he was also posting his homemade  no-budget shorts on the web site angrynakedpat.com: in one skit  he mourns the death of a pet named dr. curly  which turns out to be a package of sliced deli meat; in another  he performs an off-key  off-color song on his guitar entitled "the superbowl is gay." the latter segment caught the attention of producers at "jimmy kimmel live " who showed the video during the late-night talk show's post-super bowl debut in january 2003. and mr. kimmel personally took mr. milonakis under his wing  occasionally employing him as an announcer and correspondent on the show  and helping him develop his own series for mtv. (though its first season ran on mtv  "the andy milonakis show" will now appear on its sister channel mtv2.)  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. for mr. kimmel  it was crucial that the project retain the "latchkey kid meets 'pee-wee's playhouse' " spirit of mr. milonakis's internet shorts -- the feeling that they are taking place in an apartment  and a universe  that mr. milonakis inhabits alone. "the magic of those bits is that they aren't slick  and that it looks like he put a camera on top of his refrigerator and filmed himself " said mr. kimmel  who has a 14-year-old daughter  a 12-year-old son  a 6-year-old nephew and a 4-year-old niece -- all fans of the "the andy milonakis show." "i think every kid does a show in his bedroom and announces himself and comes and says  'i'm the greatest singer in the world!' it strikes a chord in people." but after setting up shop in a lower east side neighborhood  producers quickly discovered the value of populating "the andy milonakis show" with locals; its ensemble now includes ralphie  mr. milonakis's hulking sidekick  and rivka  an elderly woman who wears two pairs of glasses simultaneously  as well as countless indigenous shopkeepers  hasidim and retirees. "this has got to be the first sketch-comedy show where the average cast member is over 65 years old " said jonathan kimmel  the program's head writer and jimmy kimmel's brother. mr. milonakis's television apartment (on loan to producers from another local family) also played a role in the development of the show's voice  particularly the children's bedroom littered with broken action figures  musty stuffed toys and vintage board games  where writers are often sent to brainstorm ideas. ("it's always the stupidest stuff that inspires you " jonathan kimmel explained.) advertisement and inspiration is an especially precious commodity at "the andy milonakis show": it took approximately 240 skits to fill out its first eight-episode season -- not counting the handful that mtv rejected as too bizarre. "i've fought for stuff in the past that they said they didn't like on paper  but we're like: 'can we shoot it anyway? we really believe in it ' " mr. milonakis said. "and after we shoot it  we win them over." as the show prepares for its transition to mtv2 (where its nonconformist streak will likely be a better match with the anarchic children's show parody "wonder showzen" than it was with  say  the reality series "laguna beach")  not much has changed: the new season will still feature mr. milonakis's man-on-the-street interviews  as well as at least one rap video celebrating the virtues of pudding. but some of the grown-ups in the room have more ambitious hopes for the series and its potential to further mtv's long-term goals of bringing its content to the internet and beyond. "this show in particular  because of where it came from  is tailor-made for busting it out into this new world of short-form entertainment on the web and wireless " said tony disanto  an executive at mtv networks and the head of programming for mtv2. "i'd love being able to download a show i produced onto my ipod." and jimmy kimmel  an executive producer of the show  said he believed that the program would finally demonstrate the viability of the internet as a broadcast medium to rival television. "i don't know when people are going to come to grips with that " mr. kimmel said. "they still think it's some weird little thing that's somewhere between a stand-up comedy club and a telephone call. but i bet as many people have seen andy doing that super bowl video as have seen 'desperate housewives.' " but do not mention any of this to miss ballaine  who firmly believes that "the andy milonakis show" is a program made for her and her peers and not just an element of a cable network's multimedia strategy. "i think it's more for kids  because it's a comedy and it's silly " she said. "but grown-ups can watch it if they want." that assessment is fine with mr. milonakis  who has come to appreciate his adolescent devotees more than his would-be adult fans. "i love when young kids come up to me  because it's so much cuter when a little 7-year-old is just in awe " he said. "a lot of 24-  25-year-olds  they just want to manhandle me: 'yo  you gotta do that bit! yo  do a rhyme  right now!' there's a lot of idiots in the world " he added. "i'm sure i don't have to tell you that." were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,harold ford jr.  the former tennessee congressman and unsuccessful candidate for senate last year  took over as chairman of the centrist democratic leadership council today.  he succeeds tom vilsack  the former governor of iowa  who plans to spend the next year or so running for president. bill clinton  joe lieberman  dick gephardt  sam nunn  evan bayh and john breaux  all of whom harbored presidential ambitions at one time or another  are all past chairmen of the d.l.c. at least one of them became president. at a breakfast for reporters in washington  mr. ford said all the requisite centrist democratic things about taxes and trade and education and health care. he said that democrats should not shy away from talking about their faith  as long as it is genuine. he chastised republican hypocrites (unnamed  alas) who wear their faith on their sleeves while sinning in private. those who preach it the most are not always practicing the most  he said. i pray for all of them. although he clearly did not want to relive last years senate campaign  a race he lost to bob corker  one reporter asked him if he planned to attend this years superbowl. youll remember the devastating television advertisement that republicans took out against mr. ford late in the tennessee campaign in which a bare-shouldered bimbo says she met mr. ford at the playboy party at the superbowl and asked him to (wink) call me. the young woman was white; mr. ford is african-american. mr. ford smiled (grimaced?) and said  in a variation on his line last year  i love jesus  i love girls and i absolutely love football. he didnt say whether he had a ticket to this years game between the colts and the bears. he ford chose not to delve into his views on the role race played in last years senate campaign or elaborate on what advice he might have for senator barack obama  who is seeking the presidency. he said only  run hard and be honest and put it in the voters hands. thats all you can do. comments are no longer being accepted. i wonder if hell be taking jesus to the football match instead of the girls. the great disappointment for me was fords loss in 2006.  how could race not have played a part in his loss? the ad to which you refer is exactly like thurmonds ad in scthe white hand crunching up a job application.  hey  ford loves girls and footballsounds very much like 150 million other guys in the us. im delighted he is chairman of the dlc.  perhaps he can push that organization to a more progressive level. not least  i believe ford has a very serious future in american democratic politics and i wish him well. fords flip-flop on divisive gay marriage amendments offended the majority of gays and lesbians who call themselves democrats.  he enthusiastically supported them during his campaign  even while privately telling a state group he would not.  any democrat who would sell out a minority group to gain power is not deserving of a leadership position in the party. arleen  i  too  am a big fan of harold ford jr.  however  i think the ad you mention  the white hand crunching up a job application- was used by jesse helms  not strom thurmond  in the 1990 north carolina senate race against harvey gant  the black former mayor of charlotte. i think that ford ran as conservative a campaign as a democrat could and still fell three points short in tennessee. that he lost in 06 despite the strongly anti-republican sentiment throughout the country shows how much of an uphill climb the national democratic party faces in the south. dems would be wise to heed thomas schallers point that its better to look to the mountain states and consolidate the gains made on the coasts and midwest for a 2008 democratic victory. ford will likely reemerge in national politics again  but if he thinks it can be as a republican lite he is mistaken. unfortunately  centrist as the word is applied to democrats seems to specify somebody who believes jesus died for any possible sin they might commit. barack obama notes in his book  the audacity of hope  that the whole congressional black caucus believes this. to me  these delusions are not centrist  they are insane. we need more democrats who dont derive public policy from scriptures and religion  or find excuses in the death of jesus for blundering us foreign policy. unfortunately  ford is from snakebit holler  and hes not going to take on the snakes. i saw mr. corker on hardball with chris matthews shortly after the november election.  he looked guilty by association.  in my view  had harold ford won hs bid in tennessee  the democrats would have really made a clean sweep.  tennessee and the rest of the u.s are worse off for not having him in the senate.  im glad th democrats realize he still has a strong political future. poor harold ford not conservative enough for his constituency. not progressive enough for his party. too christian  too black  not black enough  exploiting his religion for politics. maybe next time around harold ford can campaign on a unicycle while juggling flaming swords. all the while he can run against another cookie cutter white male republican with a regular  name and nothing to say. there is something wrong in our society when a man as engaging and bright as harold ford jr. can lose to a dud like bob corker  and we analyze the policies and attitudes of mr. ford. harold ford was my favorite candidate of 2006. it seemed clear to me that it was only geography that kept him from winning. while  like nosheep above  i wish jesus would take a break from american politics and go back to staring in allegorical tales and scoring touchdowns  the reality is that most americans need to believe a candidate is trustworthy and some reference to the bible let them know he/she is. none-the-less  i would love the opportunity to vote for mr. ford so i am glad to see him moving onto a more national stage. you know what the most disgusting part of this whole story turns out to be? the republican operative who actually nade the race-baiting call me harold  anti-ford ad is now working for one of the gop presidential contenders  im not sure which onei  believe its mccain or possibly mitt romney. anyone even remotely associated with such a disgusting piece of  manipulation should have been drummed out of the business by his peers  but apparently in todays gop there is no standard except electoral success. if thats what it took for corker to win  he and his ad man should be thoroughly discredited!!! to jack whiteif you are going to correct someone  do it correctlyjesse helms defeated harvey gantt (not gant) with the two-white-hands ad. to nosheepcalling people who believe in christ insane and harboring delusions may not get you anywhere in light of the fact that an overwhelming majority of americans believe in jesus christ.  deal with it and move on. all the christian sanctimony on planet earth wont change the reality that nature has no stake or interest in human concerns. its time that we insisted that our politicians have reached adulthood and grasped this basic fact. all the circle-jerking on the planet cannot change it. i worked on the ford campaign in tennessee. harold ford is a great guy. hes genuine  smart and committed to one america for all. ill support him in whatever he does. hes the real deal. something about this title loves girls .. etc. i find rather discusting.  never mind mr.ford  but this is asking for trouble. how do you mix the love of girls with the love of football.  mr. ford has his values crossed up. advertisement 
sports,updated  5:10 p.m. | by the time the actress scarlett johanssons critically unacclaimed super bowl commercial for sodastream finally aired sunday night  both supporters and critics of israels occupation of the west bank had pronounced themselves satisfied with the new attention her endorsement brought to the companys factory in a jewish settlement outside jerusalem. during the game itself  there was an exchange of memes online between bloggers working for a pro-israel group in washington and contributors to the electronic intifada  a site founded by a palestinian-american in chicago. no #axe  this is how you run a #superbowl campaign about creating peace //t.co/m0uu0pczui //t.co/wfqnulb0ax  the israel project (@israelproject) 3 feb 14   scarlett johansson: this #sodastream is going to look soooo great in my kitchen! #sb48 //t.co/l9uclkehd3 #superbowlcommercials  stephanie westbrook (@stephinrome) 3 feb 14 watching from israel  where political leaders denounced secretary of state john kerry on sunday for just mentioning the prospect of a widening economic boycott against the nation should peace talks stall once again  the journalist noam sheizaf observed that praise for ms. johansson in the local press seemed to be balanced out by reports in the global media welcomed by anti-occupation activists. scarlett for israel was the headline in yedioth ahronoth  whose friday edition is the most widely read paper in israel. the editors placed the story on page 1  above the fold. international coverage of the affair  however  told a slightly different story  repeatedly referring to the settlements as illegal and highlighting the damage to johanssons image. israels foreign minister  avigdor lieberman  who lives in a settlement himself  hailed ms. johansson for her outspoken defense of the sodastream plant  and her decision to cut ties with oxfam  the influential antipoverty charity she represented until last week. oxfam objects to the factorys location in an illegal settlement built on the land and resources of palestinian communities.  despite the criticism from oxfam  and pressure from a palestinian-led movement to boycott all israeli companies  not just those operating in settlements  ms. johansson took a clearly principled stand against those who disguise their classic anti-semitism under false pretenses  mr. lieberman told yedioth ahronoth  israels most popular newspaper. our oscar goes to scarlett! he added. a pro-israel groups online campaign to thank ms. johansson for standing up for israel  illustrated by a difficult to parse image of the actress sharing a soda with the israeli prime minister and the palestinian president  similarly suggested that opposition to settlements is motivated only by anti-israel hate and that sodastream is a shining example of cooperation between the two communities. send scarlett johansson a personal thank you. rt to let others know > //t.co/qag39ctfgb //t.co/7ag1etsnew  the israel project (@israelproject) 2 feb 14 however  claims that only anti-semitism can explain opposition to trade with jewish settlements built on west bank land under military occupation since 1967 would seem to be undercut by the small but vocal community of jews in israel and the united states who support that sort of narrowly targeted boycott. as one such israeli  the author bernard avishai  explained on monday in a talking points memo post outlining the ways in which israels military occupation restricts the development palestinian economy:  boycotting companies operating in the settlements is not the same as boycotting israel. many israelis  myself included  refuse to buy wines  eggs  beauty creams  and fizzy-water makers  produced in the settlements. the least we can do is demonstrate against these ersatz  destructive communities by refusing to let them profit from our purchases the same way theyve profited from the cheap land and tax breaks that drew them there in the first place.  just after the sodastream commercial was broadcast  the american writer peter beinart  who has called on supporters of israel to boycott the settlements before the israeli presence in the west bank expands so far as to make a two-state solution impossible  retweeted critical comments from jewish and palestinian writers who contributed to his open zion blog. the single most important fact about #sodastream is that its factory sits on occupied land. everything is secondary to that. #israel  emily l. hauser (@emilylhauser) 3 feb 14 #scarjo loves helping people deny other humans equality. segregation is not cute my dear scarlett. #superbowlcommercials  maysoon zayid (@maysoonzayid) 3 feb 14 while it is difficult to say if many american football fans were even aware of the controversy over the ad  at least one american news organization  the christian broadcasting network  ran a report monday that presented the uproar in terms that exactly echoed the views of sodastreams chief executive  daniel birnbaum.           a video report on sodastreams west bank factory from the christian broadcasting network.    the cbn report was introduced as a look at how a growing boycott of israel is affecting businesses that actually help palestinians  and incorrectly conflated oxfams call for an end to trade with israeli companies based in settlements with the palestinian-led boycott  divestment and sanctions movement  known as b.d.s.  which encourages a ban on all trade with israel. after interviewing several palestinian workers who expressed gratitude for their jobs in the factory  the networks correspondent reported that  in the end  ms. johansson stood with sodastreams palestinian workers and resigned from oxfam. mr. sheizaf  the israeli journalist  dismissed as orwellian newspeak the argument that the benefits reaped by the few palestinians allowed in to the settlement to work for sodastream somehow outweighed the damage to the palestinian economy as a whole from the occupation  and the network of israeli-only towns crisscrossing the west bank that palestinians are excluded from and nearly encircled by. he added: in defending sodastream  and later johansson  there was much talk about the equal benefits palestinian workers in the factory receive. if the factory was to suffer  the logic goes  those palestinians will be the first to get hurt. i hope nobody who makes this argument seriously believes that equality exists when one party is completely dependent on the others good will. when a worker is deprived of political representation and can find himself in a military court following any controversy or problem  is he really equal? does he get his freedom to travel along with his paycheck? his right to due process?

sports,the recent monster slam-dunk by blake griffin of the los angeles clippers has ignited exactly the kind of debate the internet does so well. (no  i dont mean which parks and recreation quote goes best with this screengrab from downton abbey?) the debate: is griffins dunk the best of all time? in fact  the griffin dunk debate quickly traversed a familiar hyberbolic trajectory: from is this the dunk of the year? to is this blake griffins best dunk ever? to is this the best dunk of all time? to this is not even in the top 20 dunks of all time. which is why its handy  in such situations  to apply what i like to call the shakespeare/beatles/einstein rule  or  for short  the shakesbeatlestein principle. the shakesbeatlestein principle applies when there is an obvious  unimpeachable and inarguable answer to the question  what is the best [blank] ever? for example: who is the greatest writer of all time? shakespeare. what is the greatest pop band of all time? the beatles. who is the greatest genius of all time? einstein. this is not to say that these answers are objectively correct. only that they are the rare result of an unspoken communal coalescence around a single answer. other categories  by contrast  offer no shakesbeatlestein. for example  greatest american novel. your mind might jump immediately to moby dick or the great gatsby or invisible man  but thats the point. you could make a case for any number of candidates. the question is an argument-starter  not an argument-ender. ergo  no shakesbeatlestein. there are three qualifications to be considered a shakesbeatlestein: 1. the answer is an acknowledged consensus choice. you know that saying in sports  the road to the superbowl goes through green bay (or new england  or new york  or which ever citys team last won)? well  the road to greatest pop band ever goes through the beatles. sure  you could zag while the world zigs and say the clash or the rolling stones or  i dont know  the las  then offer some esoteric argument to back it up. that is precisely what makes these debates fun. but the fact is that what youre actually doing is giving an answer of not the beatles. and youll have to defend your decision not to choose them. the same holds true for who is the greatest writer of all time? its shakespeare  obviously. you want to make a case for keats? joyce? toni morrison? dame barbara cartland? using some complex  turn-conventional-wisdom-on-its-head approach? go ahead. but then its not a debate so much as its a case study in self-conscious contrarianism. 2. the answer has become a de facto synonym for the attribute in question. when you want to taunt a precocious child about his or her intellect  you dont say: who do you think you are? some kind of nikola tesla? no. you say: what do you think you are? einstein? similarly  when youre madly scribbling away on some literary masterpiece  your adoring mother isnt going to point at you and say  such a little wordsworth! you are such a little shakespeare  or you are nothing at all. 3. the answer is the first suggestion when you google the question. go ahead. type greatest writer of all time into google. but back to blake griffin. in the greatest-dunk-of-all-time argument  id argue that there is  in fact  a shakesbeatlestein: the vince carter dunk over frederic weis at the 2000 olympics. dont take my word for it; the experts agree. or you could just judge for yourself:  the question  then  is what other cultural figures/products/events can rightly be called shakesbeatlesteins? offhand  i can nominate a few:  shakesbeatlestein actor: sir laurence olivier.

sports,updated  5:49 p.m. | forced to choose between two endorsement deals  the actress scarlett johansson decided wednesday to end her charitable work on behalf of oxfam  an antipoverty group that opposes trade with israeli settlements  and continue as a paid brand ambassador for sodastream  a company that manufactures products in the occupied west bank. the break with oxfam comes a week after the charity said that it was engaged in a dialogue with the actress  who had helped raise funds for nearly a decade  and days before the broadcast of ms. johanssons super bowl commercial for sodastreams home carbonation machines.          a version of scarlett johanssons super bowl ad for sodastream posted on youtube by the company has been viewed more than five million times since monday.    oxfams stated position is that trade from israeli settlements  which are illegal under international law  should be discouraged because companies profiting from the continued occupation further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the palestinian communities that we work to support. last week  however  ms. johansson expressed her outspoken support for the sodastream factory in the israeli settlement of maale adumim  echoing the companys chief executive in calling the plant a bridge to peace between israel and palestine.   while the content of the talks between the actress and the charity were not made public  a statement released on her behalf contained a significant error about oxfams policy regarding israel. according to the statement  ms. johansson and oxfam parted ways because of a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott  divestment and sanctions movement.  but oxfam does not support the palestinian-led campaign known as b.d.s.  which seeks to isolate israel economically until it ends the military occupation of territories seized during the six-day war in 1967 and allows arab refugees to return to their former homes in what is now the jewish state. the charity objects to the import of goods produced in israeli settlements but is not opposed to trade with israel  an oxfam representative told the lede on thursday. despite that fact  supporters and critics of israel read the end of ms. johanssons relationship with oxfam through the lens of the b.d.s. campaign.  when an a-lister announces that shes leaving an org because of its stance on #bds  well  that  my friends  is what we call a #bdsfail. :)  avi mayer (@avimayer) 30 jan 14 #sodastream a brutal way to enjoy soda! #bds free #palestine //t.co/kw1zqflpm4  helena k. (@helenakasp) 29 jan 14 omar barghouti  a palestinian activist and the author of boycott  divestment  sanctions: the global struggle for palestinian rights  hailed the success of b.d.s. supporters in drawing attention to the ethical issues involved in the location of sodastreams factory.  without doubt  mr. barghouti said in a statement released by the institute for middle east understanding  the biggest loser in this well publicized b.d.s. campaign was sodastream  which was exposed to the whole world as an occupation profiteer. prior to this  most sodastream customers had no idea that it is involved in grave violations of human rights by producing in an illegal settlement in the occupied palestinian territory.  as the israeli blogger mairav zonszein notes  oxfams stance seems identical to that of peter beinart  author of the crisis of zionism  who  in a 2012 new york times op-ed article  called on american jews to initiate a counteroffensive to the b.d.s. campaign by lobbying for a total boycott of the settlements. mr. beinart criticized ms. johansson last week and reminded his twitter followers that prominent israeli actors and writers had refused to perform in the settlements for years. wish scarlett johannson werent fronting for soda stream. id rather stand w/ grosssman  oz  yehoshua //t.co/abtp03fe4m  peter beinart (@peterbeinart) 26 jan 14 as the lede explained last week  sodastream made ethics a part of the conversation by marketing its domestic carbonation systems as an ethical alternative for consumers concerned with the environmental impact of bottled sodas  including coke and pepsi.  in an illustration of how the association with ms. johansson was becoming an impediment to the charitys work  oxfams social-media team found itself besieged by questions about sodastream just as it was trying to draw attention to ethical questions about one of the israeli companys rivals  pepsi. in the run-up to the super bowl  oxfam has asked its twitter followers to complain to pepsi about its poor treatment of farmers in brazil and cambodia. find out what @pepsis millions of $ in #superbowl ads wont tell you about their products //t.co/tmfssy0zq2 #behindthebrands  oxfam international (@oxfam) 29 jan 14 the charitys current online campaign against pepsi  to protest the beverage companys practice of buying sugar produced on land oxfam says was unfairly taken from farmers without proper compensation  is the latest wave in a series the antipoverty group calls behind the brands. the debate over ms. johanssons endorsement of sodastream unfolded as reporters began looking more closely at the companys manufacturing plant in the mishor adumim industrial park  part of the maale adumim settlement. as the jewish daily forward in new york reported  although many israelis expect that settlement to become a part of israel after the land swaps israeli governments have insisted on in any future peace deal  maale adumim is nevertheless a settlement especially loathed by israeli peace activists. it was made possible in the 1970s by one of the largest expropriations of palestinian land implemented by the israel during its 46-year occupation of the west bank.  as the israeli human rights group btselem explained in 1999  the settlement  including the sodastream factory  was built on land taken from five palestinian towns and two bedouin tribes evicted by israeli forces.  perhaps more important  as the israeli columnist larry derfner explained in 2012  this settlement is already a stake in the heart of a prospective palestinian state  because it nearly bisects the west bank and further construction there threatens to cut off palestinians access to east jerusalem  their hoped-for capital. that appears to be less by accident than by design. mr. derfner noted that benny kashriel  the settlements longtime mayor  told the jerusalem report in 2004  maale adumim was established to break palestinian contiguity. the settlement  he added  is jerusalems connection to the dead sea and the jordan valley; if we werent here  palestinians could connect their villages and close off the roads. maale adumim necessarily cuts the west bank in two. while opponents of settlement trade  like oxfam  argue that the relatively small number of jobs generated by factories there do not outweigh the crippling effect of israels military occupation on the palestinian economy as a whole  sodastreams defenders contend that the plant is a boon to hundreds of local workers. the companys chief executive  daniel birnbaum  told the forward this week that although the location was a pain  and that sodastream could move all of its manufacturing to a factory inside israelis internationally recognized borders  he would not do so out of concern for the palestinians who would lose their jobs. we will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyones political agenda  he said. the newspaper also reported that during its correspondents visit  mr. birnbaum was applauded by palestinian workers in the plants employee cafeteria when he reassured them that their jobs were safe.  mr. birnbaum also told a reuters reporter who visited the factory the next day that the sodastream factory was a dream for activists and politicians on both sides of this dilemma  because its a model for peace and is proving every day that there can and will be peace between our peoples.  the reporter  noah browning  noted however that a mid-level palestinian employee who spoke to reuters outside the plant  away from the bosses  painted a far less perfect picture. theres a lot of racism here  he said  speaking on condition of anonymity. most of the managers are israeli  and west bank employees feel they cant ask for pay rises or more benefits because they can be fired and easily replaced.  the lede is a blog that remixes national and international news stories -- adding information gleaned from the web or gathered through original reporting -- to supplement articles in the new york times and draw readers in to the global conversation about the news taking place online. readers are encouraged to take part in the blogging by using the comments threads to suggest links to relevant material elsewhere on the web or by submitting eyewitness accounts  photographs or video of news events. read more.     the lede will no longer be updated  but the blogs regular features will remain a part of the new york times news report. readmore     the family of an egyptian journalist detained for nine months without charge expressed outrage that images of him were leaked to a facebook page run by interior ministry sympathizers.readmore     one of the stars of happy in tehran  an exuberant music video that offended the sensibilities of irans conservative judiciary  reported on instagram wednesday that she was free.readmore     six young iranians were arrested and forced to repent on state television tuesday for the grievous offense of proclaiming themselves to be happy in tehran  in a homemade music video they posted on youtube.readmore     security-camera footage obtained by a rights group appears to show the fatal shooting of two young palestinians during a demonstration in beitunia  in the israeli-occupied west bank.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,like a lot of americans  the bagger was ready for some football last night. he put a buck twenty on the colts to cover  the only good bet hes made all season  ordered up a bucket of chicken and kicked back. the only problem is this oscar blog needed feeding  so he spent time searching for the ever-elusive oscar hook. he came up with  well  not much. the bagger could have used the pregame flyover  top gun got four nominations in 1986  but that would have been cheating. billy joel did the national anthem  but he has he never even been nominated for an oscar. the bagger feels  though  that he can now cite him as the winner of  the phoning in a song from the greatest distance in the history of sung music award. mr. joel  who might want to think about putting out an apb for his soul  was clearly pissed he was sitting out in the rain playing a piano  with nothing between him and nature but a sopped pate. but the bagge noticed that the person doing the sign language translation of the anthem was marlee matlin.  bingo! best actress winner in 1986 for children of a lesser god.  still  she came and went in a flash. the rest of the pickings were so slim they were one dimensional. there was an ad for norbit  which stars eddie murphy  one of the oscar actor favs this year  depending on who you ask.  another ad was for wild hogs  which looks odious and seems to involve some codgers who have sold their walkers and bought harleys  but does include two academy award nominees  william h. macy and john travolta  and one winner  marisa tomei. but it was just a commercial. (apparently  the studios choked on the price tag  so there werent many this year.) the bagger had all but given up hope when the halftime show came and his royal purpleness  the modern king of soul  the symbol as archetype cum rockstar  ladies and gentleman  the artist formerly and presently known as prince  appeared. a winner for original song in 1984  purple rain  he stepped into the downpour and turned the rain to steam. prince is the one person who could take something as cheesy as the halftime show of the superbowl and turn it into an incendiary guitar tutorial and a funked up parody of the thing itself. the bagger is from minneapolis  as is the little guy  so he is obvious in the tank for him. more importantly  prince roger nelson gave the bagger a way to drop all the super bowl nonsense into his blog. lets go crazy! lets get nuts! comments are no longer being accepted. i agree  prince stole the show. just when we thought halftime shows were ridiculous  he took it to another level. i couldnt turn the channel  even for the puppy bowl now  bagger  if you had switched to the animal channel  you would have seen the descendents of some oscar contenders there  too! by the way  marlee is in that ground-breaking film  what the bleep? from a few years back. i really liked it. a correction prince did not win for original song in 1984  he won for original song score (for the 1984 calendar year  awarded in 1985). his acceptance was one of the funniest-bizarre things ive ever seen in 25 years of  watching the oscars. and i couldnt help but notice a year later that  the category had been eliminated. cara buckley is your guide on the red carpet to the news and the nonsense of awards season  covering the golden globes  the oscars and more. the carpetbagger will take a look at films and the people who make and star in them. she's joined by michael cieply and brooks barnes in los angeles  larry rohter on foreign-language films and documentaries  mekado murphy on the  technical craft of filmmaking and rachel lee harris on costume design. tips are always welcome.  advertisement

is this cost-effective? stuart elliott enlightens us here. and  o.k.  maybe the web exposure is worth more than holding the ad back for a hollywood-style premiere. but maybe when youve seen 87 versions of an ad on youtube (check out  for example  kevin federline for nationwide) and then it appears in the living room on the bigger screen  all dialed to that hideous sports coloration  you just dont care. its all played out. the ad  which is one of those with a big  broad reveal  after all  is like a spent joke. for its part  nationwide is busy telling and retelling its joke on its own site. i just want to hear from one person who signs up for nationwide insurance  believing it to be on his or her side  having seen federline fantasize about hip-hop stardom. comments are no longer being accepted. its not about having a good commercial on game day- its about getting your name out as much as possible.  nationwide is getting tons opress for this commercial  and everytime the commercial is written about  so is their name.  sounds like a bargain to me. yes  but 2.6 million is chickenfeed for the entities involved.  why not 2.6 billion?  the value is determined by how much youre throwing away.  the price of the buzz is the buzz.  the money itself doesnt have a fixed value.  but the buzz  not priceless  is a marker of existence. i find it racist of you to have used noh theater as a statement of impenetrability. its an affront to compare something as banal as britneys overexposed ex to something as sublime as an 700-year-old form of theater. youre simply not learned. i agree with the first two comments. nationwide is buying brand awareness. when a 25-year-old buy nationwide insurance in 3 years  he wont remember that he first heard of the company though a federline commercial.   and to what?: calling something impenetrable indicates an appreciation of complexity  not an insult.  i dont think virginia was being racist towards irish people when she mentioned finnegans wake in the same sentence. youre talking about it  so it must have some effect. and the beauty of youtube? you choose to watch it or not. so i applaud your grit; watching 87 different versions of the same ad is painful  even for those of us who get paid to do so im waiting until the superbowl to watch these ads in glorious hd  without download waits  while sitting in front of a screen ten times the size of my computer monitor  with a bowl of chili in hand. um  excuse me? what does the comparison of advertising to noh theatre have to do with the theory that certain human abilities and characteristics are determined by their race? lets stop heating up our keyboards with rash accusations and show a little more tactful intelligence with our word choice. let me get this straight they are already getting tons of free press and also space time with everyone they have driven to their website to view the video. basically  two weeks of free advertising. priceless! and the part where you refer to the ad being played out is wrong and shows your disdain for the venue. there will be a projected 140 million plus viewers of the superbowl and i seriously doubt they have all seen the video already. its a decent ad so i would proffer that most people will actually enjoy seeing it again. have checked out the increase in traffic to companies websites after their ads run? also  my non-scientific polling shows that about half of the people i have surveyed are really more interested in the commercials they will see than the game while enjoying their superbowl parties. i could go on and on but really  tell the truth  did you do any actual research for this or were you just ranting? hey what? gives us all a break.  should the irish be mad as well because he metioned finnegans wake.  i find you to be racist since you seem to see everything through that lens. you have also mispelled finnegans wake. what?  perhaps you should give the piece a quick once-over. the simile was between the increasingly complex world of advertising and noh  not between federline and noh. further  if anything is racist surrounding this post it is federlines wigger pantomime. the noh comment is only one in a long line of stereotypical adjectives and similes used to describe  the arts of non-western ethnicities in the new york times culture pages. take any review of a japanese dance group  movie  art exhibit  whatever  and you will find words such as inscrutable  impenetrable  strange  etc. take any review of a brazilian dance group or flamenco and youll find words like fiery  earthy  etc. we all know that the media  including the new york times  is owned by the hegemonic socio-economic-political-ethnic groups  but cant the new york times editors come out with a better vocabulary to describe non-western art forms?! noh might have been too obvious a placeholder for complex  but i didnt mean to set in motion the old japan/inscrutability equation.  the japanese theater im more familiar withkabuki and esp. takarazuka (which i love)is plainly far from arcane. so are anime  manga  japanese visual art  contemporary japanese novels  etc. but the slowness and subtlety of noh  as well as its many rules  make it pretty difficult to appreciate for modern audiences who are unfamiliar with its conventions.  my sincere apologies to what? if my reference seemed simpleminded or xenophobic.  as for my misspelling of finnegans wake  thats also lame. its been corrected. thanks  chriss. and thanks to all for good comments. with television and the internet converging at last  who's going to watch all this here-goes-nothing online video?

sports,good monday morning from washington  where the redskins havent made the super bowl since the 1991 season  but where theres always a home team on capitol hill. leading the news: president obama unveils his budget today. he is also talking about how a book of short stories by a marine veteran has influenced his thinking on americas wars. senator marco rubio of florida has a book of his own  which he is promoting in early primary states  and mitch mcconnells promotion to majority leader seems to have brought out the lighter side of the kentucky senator. a come-from-behind victory  a last-minute interception  an end-zone fight. super bowls dont get much more exciting. right? speak up  potential presidential candidates. thats what twitter is for. whats that? nothing to say? you might excuse republicans for showing little enthusiasm for a game in which both teams were from states that are reliably democratic. but still  one of the teams is named the patriots. that was enough for sarah palin  who posted on twitter an image of new englands coach  bill belichick  wearing a dont tread on me t-shirt on his way into the stadium. that is all good she wrote. gov. chris christie of new jersey  a noted fan of the dallas (havent been to the super bowl in 19 years) cowboys  admitted that he was watching the game  although he was watching #superbowlxlix at the albion pub in london with a few @rutgersuexchange students. and senator rand paul of kentucky was promoting his rand 2016 liberty footballs  the triangular paper kind. but the others? former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania was promoting book signings  former gov. mike huckabee of arkansas was asking his twitter followers to help him end the irs  and mitt romney has not posted on the social media network since announcing on friday that he would not join the presidential race. the official accounts of ben carson  former gov. jeb bush of the football-mad florida  former gov. rick perry of the football-mad texas  gov. bobby jindal of louisiana  senator lindsey graham of south carolina all went silent. but what did senator marco rubio of florida mean when he wrote: who will win the #superbowl? retweet for patriots  favorite for seahawks? it wasnt any different on the democratic side  although there were far fewer twitter feeds to check. the sports fan in hillary rodham clinton was on display  but it was in a twitter tribute to the late ernie banks  a chicago cubs legend  on jan. 24.  steve kenny president obama rolls out his $4 trillion budget on monday  although the multivolume spending plan is more likely to be used as a doorstop by republicans on capitol hill than as a starting point for a budget of their own. the fiscal plan allows mr. obama to lay out his priorities with a menu of initiatives that seek to rally democrats around him. it is also the necessary first step to any agreement with the republican majority in congress on federal spending for 2016 and beyond. republicans have been clear that they want nothing to do with the presidents proposals on a program to make community college tuition-free for millions  new taxes on wealthy americans and higher fees on big banks. and most oppose the administrations proposal to increase financing for domestic agencies  though there is republican support for plans to provide more money for the pentagon. for the first time since mr. obama took office  republicans will be responsible for producing a budget in both the house and senate. they have said that passing a spending plan that balances the budget within a decade will be evidence of their ability to govern  so it would be a major setback for the republicans if they fail to come to an agreement among themselves. and while the president doesnt sign the congressional budget  he will have to agree to the spending bills and other policy initiatives that grow out of it. so while republicans are unhappy with the presidents plan  they may ultimately have to give him some of what he wants  so they can get some of what they want.  carl hulse one of the books president obama read on his december vacation was redeployment  a collection of short stories by phil klay about the war in iraq. mr. klay  a former marine who served in iraq  writes of brutality and faith  guilt and fear  helplessness and survival  according to the authors website. the book was a painful reminder  the president said on sunday  that his decisions as commander in chief have consequences for the men and women serving in americas wars. the antiseptic plans and decisions and strategies  and the opining of pundits that take place in washington  you know  is very different from war and conflict as its experienced by people on the ground  mr. obama said in recommending the book during an interview on cnns fareed zakaria gps. mr. obama used the discussion of mr. klays book to vent about the political climate in washington  taking on columnists and editorial writers and making a veiled swipe at congressional hawks who have pushed him for years to be more aggressive overseas. we cant play political games  and we cant engage in bluster or reaction or  you know  try to beat our chests when we make these decisions  he said. if were going to deploy folks to war  it better be for a darn good reason  and we better have a very clear objective that is worthy of the sacrifices that these folks make.  michael d. shear senator marco rubios book tour this month looks a lot like campaign barnstorming through states with early primaries and caucuses. the florida republican will hit the road during the congressional recess to promote his book american dreams  with stops at barnes & noble stores in west des moines  iowa (feb. 13); las vegas (feb. 18); greenville  s.c. (feb. 19) and manchester  n.h. (feb. 23). that means stops in four states that are among the first on the republican nominating calendar. this is not a coincidence. even his staff says so. senator rubio has said he is seriously considering running for president  and his schedule this month reflects that  said alex conant  a rubio spokesman. as he meets with people across the country  he is sharing his new ideas to confront 21st-century problems. his goal is to pass new reforms so that more people can achieve the american dream. mr. rubio has made room for fund-raising events between book signings in places like texas and chicago. and anna rogers  who previously worked with the karl rove group american crossroads  starts her job with team rubio on monday as finance director at his reclaim america pac  just in time for the tour.  ashley parker the release of president obamas budget for the 2016 fiscal year. in its latest attempt to undercut the affordable care act  the house rules committee takes up a bill to repeal the health law. the full house will vote on the bill as early as tuesday. the sans institute holds a meeting on cyberthreat intelligence with experts from the f.b.i.  the department of homeland security  private industry and policy groups. the atlantic council presents a report on what the united states and nato must do to preserve ukraines independence. the commerce department releases personal income and spending numbers for december  and the institute for supply management releases its manufacturing index for january. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky isnt known for sparkling wit or a sharp sense of humor  but guests at an exclusive alfalfa club dinner said both were on display saturday night at the capitol hilton in washington. mr. mcconnell took shots at himself; at mitt romney  a new club member; and at his senate colleagues. witnesses said he even roused the audience by expressing a willingness to work with the president on immigration policy. the new majority leader acknowledged that he faced challenges from both the left and right in running the senate  noting that senator ted cruz of texas had said he was willing to throw himself in front of a train to repeal the new health care law. that idea has some merit to it  mr. mcconnell cracked.  carl hulse president obamas budget focuses on policies to address income inequality. the united states is considering a plan to arm ukraines military forces. fighting there continues. gov. chris christie of new jersey finds his star power doesnt pack much heat in london. wisconsins state treasurer is making good on a campaign promise: he has dismissed his entire staff and is working on eliminating his own job. despite the ebola scare last fall  a clinical trial in liberia of a drug to treat the disease has been called off because of a shortage of patients. gov. scott walker of wisconsin stands to be the biggest beneficiary of mitt romneys withdrawal  politico says. vox thinks so  too.the latest des moines register opinion poll has mr. walker leading the field in iowa  a year before the caucuses there. the new yorker says that pope francis is complicating the presidential aspirations of the three catholics on the republican shortlist: gov. chris christie of new jersey  former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania and former gov. jeb bush of florida. (the rest of the bushes may not be catholic  but jebs wife is  and he converted to catholicism.) dana milbank of the washington post says that senator bernard sanders of vermont doesnt seem inclined to be a ralph nader  and that he would probably run as a democrat if he were to seek the presidency. the national journal rounds up the most ridiculous pac names heading into the 2016 race. the secret service arrested and charged a man with unlawful entry after he climbed atop a bicycle rack outside the white house grounds  the associated press reports. like the politics newsletter? get it delivered to your inbox.    first draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by the new york times. come back throughout the day for the latest news and analysis  and be part of the political conversation.     like it? hate it? have a tip for us? send any and all feedback to firstdraft@nytimes.com.              we send out a newsletter around 7 a.m. eastern time each weekday that serves as a look-ahead to the day's political events and expected stories.

sports,advertisement  charles m. blow feb. 10  2012  twitter claims another casualty. this week  roland martin  a bombastic cultural and political commentator was suspended by cnn from his role as a political analyst on the network for twitter messages published during the super bowl. one message read: if a dude at your super bowl party is hyped about david beckhams h&m underwear ad  smack the ish out of him! #superbowl. another read: who the hell was that new england patriot they just showed in a head to toe pink suit? oh  he needs a visit from #teamwhipdatass. the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation said the messages advocated violence against gay people and asked cnn to fire martin. cnn called the messages regrettable and offensive and suspended him for the time being. martin issued an apology in which he said that he was just joking about smacking someone. there is vigorous debate online about what martin meant  about glaads reaction  and about cnns policy on who gets suspended or fired and for what kinds of statements. advertisement martin and glaad have signaled  over twitter  that they plan to meet and discuss the matter. maybe something positive will emerge from that. advertisement but whether it does or not  i dont want to let this incident pass without using it as a teachable moment for us all about the dangerous way in which we define manhood and masculinity. at the very least  martins comments are corrosive on this front. i follow martin on twitter. i know that he likes to joke and tease. i have even joked with him. so i can believe that  in his mind  he may have thought that these were just harmless jokes in which the violence was fictional and funny. but in the real world  where bullying and violence against gays and lesbians  or even those assumed to be so  is all too real  jokes like his hold no humor. there are too many bruised ribs and black eyes and buried bodies for the targets of this violence to just lighten up and laugh. we all have to understand that effects can operate independent of intent  that subconscious biases can move counter to conscious egalitarianism  and that malice need not be present within the individual to fuel the maliciousness of the society at large. (this is not to say that martin has been egalitarian on this front. in fact  a widely cited 2006 post on his web site suggests otherwise. in it  he criticized the rev. al sharpton for appealing to black churches to become more accepting and embracing of homosexuality. martin wrote that gays and lesbians are engaged  in the eyes of the church  in sinful behavior. furthermore  he said  my wife  an ordained baptist minister for 20 years  has counseled many men and women to walk away from the gay lifestyle  and to live a chaste life. and he compared homosexuals to adulterers  disobedient children  alcoholics and thieves.) words have power. and power recklessly exerted has consequences. its not about being politically correct. its about being sensitive to the plight of those being singled out. we cant ask the people taking the punches to also take the jokes. and its about understanding that masculinity is wide enough and deep enough for all of us to fit in it. but society in general  and male culture in particular  is constantly working to render it narrow and shallow. we have shaved the idea of manhood down to an unrealistic definition that few can fit in it with the whole of who they are  not without severe constriction or self-denial.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the man that we mythologize in the backs of our minds is a cultural concoction  an unattainable ideal  a perfect specimen of muscles and fearlessness and daring. square-jawed and well-rounded. potent and passionate. sensitive but not sentimental. and  above all else  unwaveringly heterosexual and without even a hint of softness. advertisement a vast majority of men will never be able to be all these things all the time  but they shouldnt be made to feel less than a man because of it. and this narrowed manhood ideal has a truly damaging effect on boys. in boy culture: an encyclopedia  which was published in 2010  the editors point out: boys are men in training. as such  most strive to enact and replicate hegemonic masculinity so that they achieve status among male peers  and pre-emptively guard against accusations or perceptions that their masculinity is deficient. the editors went on to quote a 2001 study in which a boy who does not measure up to dominant prescriptions of masculinity is likely to be punished by his peers in ways which seek to strip him of his mantle of masculinity. in fact  a 2005 report entitled from teasing to torment: school climate in america  which was commissioned by the gay  lesbian and straight education network  found that a third of all teens said that they are often bullied  called names or harassed at their school because they are  or people think that they are  gay  lesbian or bisexual. we have created this culture  and we can undo it. start with this fact: the truest measure of a man  indeed of a person  is not whom he lies down with but what he stands up for. if we must be judged  let it be in this way. and when we fall short  as we sometimes will  because humanity is fallible  let us greet each other with compassion and encouragement rather than ridicule and resentment. whatever was in martins heart  what was in his twitter messages wasnt helpful. they may not lead directly to intimidation or violence  but they may add to a stream of negativity that feeds a culture in which intimidation and violence by some twisted minds is all too real. i dont believe that martin wanted that. lets show the whole of mankind that men can indeed be kind  even to other men who dare to wear pink suits.  i invite you to join me on facebook and follow me on twitter  or e-mail me at chblow@nytimes.com. a version of this op-ed appears in print on february 11  2012  on page a21 of the new york edition with the headline: real men and pink suits.  today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
sports,at ellis island on tuesday morning  the crowd eagerly awaited joe namath. he was a guest of honor at an annual awards ceremony at which his family was being honored for the nobility of its immigrant experience.       but across the hudson  at battery park  the football legend with the million-dollar smile was just another guy in the queue waiting for the ellis island ferry. it was his opportunity to get a small taste of what his hungarian forbears had experienced when they set foot here nearly a century ago: long lines  hard benches and a gaggle of uniformed officers trying to keep things moving.      approaching the metal detector  the jet once known as broadway joe had to empty his pockets: wallet  coins  the sharpie he uses to accommodate autograph seekers. then he removed his super bowl ring from 1969  the upset win against the colts that he famously guaranteed. he laid it in the bin. a security officer handed it back  but did make him take off his belt.     mr. namath reminisced while waiting for the boat about his first impression of new york: a trip with some university of alabama chums to the worlds fair in 1964. to this day  it amazes him that his car was waiting where he had haphazardly left it in manhattan.  that wouldnt happen today  he said.      no ticket  either. maybe they didnt want to bother with out-of-state plates  he mused.     wearing a gold apple in his lapel and accompanied by his daughters  jessica and olivia  he wondered aloud how his grandfather andras nemet and his father  janos  neither of whom spoke english on arrival  had the fortitude for the long journey from the carpathian mountains to the pennsylvania steel town where he was raised. neither made much fuss about what they had endured and just worked hard to assimilate  according to mr. namath.       his paternal grandfather  later known as andy namath  arrived in 1911 aboard the r.m.s. pannonia. but janos was left behind with his grandparents and did not rejoin the family until his mother went back for him in 1920. by that time  the boy was 11. to this day  it just gives more credence to my belief that he came through big-time  mr. namath said of his father.        on the ferry  he ran into candice bergen  the actress who had been asked by the statue of liberty-ellis island foundation to formally announce him and the other winners of family heritage awards  a rarefied circle that included jerry seinfeld  the comedian  and dr. eric r. kandel  the nobel laureate. she also gave gloria and emilio estefan  cuban-born entertainers  a separate award that goes each year to newer arrivals.    i hope i dont get seasick  mr. namath confided to ms. bergen. this is not my kind of boat  really.     hes half-joking  explained his elder daughter  jessica. she noted that her father owns a 24-foot fishing boat named xii in homage to his longtime jersey number. she said he caught his first swordfish this jan. 12  the 40th anniversary of that superbowl win.     he had spent the day catching spanish mackerel  went home for a nap and then went back out at midnight to try his hand at swordfish. to get swordfish   you have to go at night  she explained. its a whole nother thing.  comments are no longer being accepted. broadway joe  we still need heroes. thank you for being you! enem as a native alabamian  not sure why he picked u of a to go to college but i suspect it had a lot to do with the legendary coach bear bryant  when he said will you play for me?  you did and im glad he did  as he did a lot for our state. glad someone did a nice thing for him  broadway joe. bear bryant referred to joe willie namath as the greatest athlete he ever coached.  now  really  what more needs to be said?   i literally grew up idolizing joe willie  he hit bama when i was 11  and my dad and i would eat the golden flake potato chips and coca cola that were the shows sponsors while we watched the bear briyant show every sunday afternoon during football season and listen to the bear growl about how great namath was.  the guaranteed victory over the colts my senior year of high school just topped off what i thought was the career of the man i thought had just unseated johnny unitas as the greatest qb in the nfl.  and you cant imagine what a trip that had to be until you visit beaver falls. namath will always be a hero in this town.by the way in hindsight that super bowl winning jets team had agreat roster and deserved to win super bowl 3 a great story about joes family. living in alabama and a crimson tide supporter i have followed joes career for many years. it was great to learn this about his family. take care joe! one of the greatest things about broadway joe is that he is still an everymandespite his nicknames connotation.  i had the pleasure of meeting joe a couple of years ago.  being a life-long supporter of the crimson tide  i was beside myself with pride and emotion.  yet joe took a few minutes to talk to me  he signed a football i had with me  and shook my hand and wished me well. few of the greats in the nfl would repeat such a performance to a mere fan.  (peyton manning excluded  he was a terrific guy when i met him too.)  i hope joe will also be recognized as an ambassador for the sport and an elder statesman; not simply for his brilliance on the field but for his character off of the field. joe was one of my heroes growing up  bookended by mickey mantle and walt frazier. he is the reason i have been a diehard jets fan for 43 years and counting  despite now having lived  like tequesta  fl resident joe himself  in dolphins territory for a number of those years. joe is the greatest!! new york today is still going strong! though no longer on city room  new york today continues to appear every weekday morning  offering a roundup of news and events for the city. you can find the latest new york today at nytoday.com or in the morning  on the new york times homepage or its new york section. you can also receive it via email. metropolitan diary continues to publish! since 1976  metropolitan diary has been a place for new yorkers  past and present  to share odd fleeting moments in the city. we will continue to publish one item each weekday morning and a round-up in monday's print edition.  you can find the latest entries at nytimes.com/diary and on our new york section online.  city room  a news blog of live reporting  features and reader conversations about new york city  has been archived. send questions or suggestions  by e-mail.  advertisement 
sports,the breakfast meetingwhats making news in media.the komen foundation  the nations leading breast cancer advocacy organization  found itself facing a furor  and a mutiny among its local chapters  as the internet buzzed with reaction to the groups decision to largely end its partnership with planned parenthood. the foundation said the decision had nothing to do with politics or abortion  but critics and a former board member disagreed  jennifer preston and gardiner harris reported. like the internet-led protest against antipiracy legislation  the controversy showed how social networking can change the national conversation with head-snapping speed  they wrote. whats making news in media. the year 2012  or xlvi  if you prefer  will be known for super bowl ad creep  stuart elliott reports. companies used to try to build anticipation  holding back the ads for their debut during the big game; this year  by some estimates  almost half of the 50-plus commercials that are scheduled to appear in the super bowl are already online in one form or another  including anticipated ones from volkswagen and honda. the idea  he writes  is to move the water-cooler conversation that takes place after the game to before the game. on the news that facebook had filed for a multibillion-dollar initial public offering  somini sengupta looks at how mark zuckerberg managed to control so much of the company  almost 60 percent of voting shares. it is more than other tech entrepreneurs typically managed to retain before they went public  including bill gates (49 percent) and the co-founders of google (16 percent each). his strategy  she writes: remain in charge  stave off potential predators and expand the company so quickly that no one can challenge the boss. after reports  including in the times  had donald trump endorsing newt gingrich in time for the nevada caucuses  mr. trump held a news conference to support mitt romney. he was on his best behavior  mark leibovich writes  and said simply: hes not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love. mr. romney may have best summed up the surreal scene  framed by gold plating  at mr. trumps casino: there are some things that you cant imagine happening in your life  he said. and this is one of them.     the fox network announced four new dramas and five new comedies it has ordered for the next television season.readmore     the new york times media news can now be found at the media & advertising section front.readmore     david zinczenko  the former rodale executive who wrote the eat this  not that series  will write three books on exercise  diet and nutrition  and form a new imprint  zinc ink.readmore     the race  ethnicity and culture reporting in nprs series changing races is part of the networks strategy to do better about mirroring america  the chief executive says.readmore     the emmy-winning actor may replace carson daly in a late-night half hour interview program  according to one executive involved in the networks program planning.readmore follow advertisement 
sports, was the super bowl ad featuring clint eastwood  its halftime in america  a chrysler ad or an obama re-election ad? confusion abounded. after all  the spot seemed to tout the success of the auto bailouts  which the four remaining republican presidential candidates were against. halftime is also an easy metaphor for a president whos nearing the end of one term but seeking a second. as soon as the ad ran  my twitter timeline lit up with people who thought it was a re-election ad. to which i tweeted: @charlesmblow charles m. blow some of you make a good point: did david axelrod find a way to sneak an obama re-election ad into the superbowl? #clint mon feb 6 1:25:14  via charles m. blow that was a joke of course. but the ad was no laughing matter to karl rove  the bush-era minister of machiavellianism. on monday  rove told fox news  i was  frankly  offended by it. there was more: this is a sign of what happens when you have the government getting in bed with big business like the bailout of the auto companies. they begin to  the leadership of the auto companies feel they need to do something to repay their political patrons. remember  we lost $1.8 billion as taxpayers on the government bailout of chrysler  and were going to lose $14 billion in the bailout of chrysler and general motors. and you got to bet in the boardrooms and management suites of these two big car companies  they are saying to themselves  look  the president bailed us out rather than making us go through the normal bankruptcy  he bailed us out. were going to end up not having to pay back this money to the taxpayers. rove went on to say: this is a sign of what happens when you have chicago-style politics  and the president of the united states and his political minions are  in essence  using our tax dollars to buy corporate advertising and the best wishes of the management  which is benefited by getting a bunch of our money that theyll never pay back. first  lets be clear about clint  if thats possible. he was actually opposed to the bailouts. he told the los angeles times in november: we shouldnt be bailing out the banks and car companies. if a c.e.o. cant figure out how to make his company profitable  then he shouldnt be the c.e.o. as for his political ideology  things are a bit ambiguous. as the washington post noted on monday: he was the nonpartisan mayor of carmel  calif.  for two years. george h.w. bush considered asking eastwood to be his running mate in 1988. while he has supported some democrats in california  eastwood said in 2011 that he couldnt recall ever voting for a democratic presidential candidate. in 2008  he supported sen. john mccain (r-ariz.). there is a lot of confusion swirling around under that furrowed brow. now that we have that out of the way  lets get to roves deceptive lateral pass of all the chrysler bailout blame to the obama administration. the detroit news was quick to point out yesterday that it was george w. bush who stroked the first check to chrysler. rove didnt mention that it was bush who first agreed to save chrysler. how convenient. chrysler nearly collapsed in late 2008 under private equity ownership. bush agreed to a $4 billion bailout of the company. as factcheck.org has pointed out: chrysler received $4 billion on jan. 2  2009  (18 days before obama took office) and $8.5 billion on april 30 (when obama was president)  according to this government accountability office report (page 9) on tarp. factcheck.org went on to outline what happened next  citing a government accountability office report issued on may 10: when chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30  2009  the new chrysler that emerged assumed only some of the $4 billion loaned by the bush administration. in a new report issued last month  the g.a.o. explained that treasury  under the obama administration  wrote off $1.6 billion of the original $4 billion loan extended to the old chrysler. as of may  chrysler had returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments  interest and cancelled commitments. however  treasury conceded that it is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in chrysler. in july the government sold its stock in the company  further reducing the loss.as the times reported: the federal government on thursday shed the last of its stake in chrysler  giving majority control of the carmaker to fiat  the italian company  while leaving taxpayers $1.3 billion short of recovering the full investment they made two years ago to keep chrysler from going out of business. the article continued: the treasury department said in a statement that it had recovered $11.2 billion of the $12.5 billion it lent to chrysler and that it would write off the bulk of the balance. the unpaid portion is on the balance sheet of the old chrysler  a collection of unwanted assets being liquidated in bankruptcy. now  lets weigh whatever losses there may be against the benefits. as david kiley  editor-in-chief of aol autos  put it in may: in all  the center for automotive research (car) in ann arbor  mich.  reckons the governments bailouts of the u.s. auto industry spared more than 1.14 million jobs in 2009  and prevented additional personal income losses of nearly $97 billion in 2009 and 2010. another 314 400 jobs were saved in 2010. the research organization based its conclusions on the potential impact of auto-industry collapse for jobs at u.s. automakers and suppliers  and ripple effects on the economy at large. when viewed this way  a $1.3 billion loss  or as rove puts it a $1.8 billion loss  is negligible and well worth it. trying to eschew bushs role in order to tarnish obamas results is fundamentally dishonest. trying to put the bailouts or the loss solely on obama is simply dishonest. oh  karl. that thing slapping you in the face is called the truth. as clint eastwood might say  get

sports,advertisement by stuart elliottfeb. 3  2005  even before kickoff  the super bowl has its first advertising casualty. in a highly unusual last-minute reversal  the ford motor company withdrew a commercial from the game late yesterday in the face of complaints. ford canceled a spot for a new lincoln truck  scheduled for the second quarter of super bowl xxxix on sunday  because of charges from an advocacy organization that it exploited the sex scandals embroiling the catholic church. the withdrawal of the commercial  showing how a mischievous girl's prank caused a clergyman to be tempted by a 2006 lincoln mark lt pickup  underlined how tender sensibilities are after the controversy over super bowl xxxviii. advertisers and agencies want to make sure they are not faced with the same loud outcry generated last february by janet jackson's "wardrobe malfunction" during the halftime show and by a string of spots with characters like a flatulent horse and a crotch-biting dog  which many viewers condemned as vulgar and tasteless. typically  madison avenue barrels boldly into the super bowl  unleashing a barrage of glitzy  expensive commercials that do just about anything to capture the attention of what is usually the biggest audience of the year for any television program. the goal is to take advantage of perhaps the only day each year when consumers embrace advertising rather than flee it. advertisement but as advertisers and agencies gear up for super bowl xxxix  their usual self-confident strut has resembled more of a gingerly tiptoe. lincoln mercury executives said earlier yesterday that they would not withdraw the commercial  calling it light-hearted entertainment and disputing critics' interpretation of the spot. but hours later  ford motor made the decision to withdraw. advertisement "in the end  we decided that while we don't agree with their assessment  we're understanding of their opinion " said sara tatchio  a spokeswoman for lincoln mercury in dearborn  mich.  referring to the critics. "we want to make sure the attention is on the truck  not on the controversy." lincoln mercury has not decided whether to run another commercial in place of the mark lt spot  ms. tatchio said  or whether to proceed with plans to put up the commercial on a special web site over the weekend. ford motor will run a commercial for another brand  volvo  in the third quarter of the game. the withdrawn commercial  by the dearborn office of young & rubicam  part of the young & rubicam brands division of the wpp group  was intended to introduce the mark lt  a successor to the failed lincoln blackwood pickup. in the spot  an actor dressed as a clergyman finds a key to a mark lt in the collection plate after services  then covetously appraises it in the parking lot -- only to learn from a congregant that it was a prank by his mischievous daughter  rather than a donation. the spot ends with the clergyman posting "lust" as the theme of his next sermon. "our members find it offensive " david clohessy  national director of the advocacy organization complaining about the commercial  said before the withdrawal became known. his organization is called snap  for survivors network of those abused by priests. mr. clohessy  who commented after watching a version of the commercial on a web site about super bowl advertising  superbowl-ads.com  complained that the actor was dressed as a catholic or episcopalian priest and described the child  an actor about 6 years old  as looking "shy and compliant." after learning that ford motor had withdrawn the commercial  mr. clohessy said the decision would "spare a lot of people a lot of pain." "we certainly understand that people can interpret the ad in different ways and we never alleged maliciousness " mr. clohessy said. "but anything that avoids rubbing salt into a deep wound is good." advertisement ms. tatchio said the actor in the spot was meant to be "a nondenominational clergyman " not a priest. and john fitzpatrick  the lincoln mercury general marketing manager  said the commercial had been tested with consumers  who described it with words like "fun" and "humanity." the spot was also approved by the standards and practices department of the fox broadcasting company  the news corporation unit that is selling about 30 minutes' worth of commercial time -- at a record average rate of $2.4 million for each 30 seconds -- during the game.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. even before the decision to withdraw the lincoln commercial  advertisers were voicing caution. "the advertising in this year's super bowl will be much safer than in the super bowl a year ago " said karen gough  president for the americas at the ciba vision unit of novartis in atlanta. novartis will run a commercial to promote its new o2 optics brand of contact lenses. the brighter spotlight being shone on the commercials "was absolutely a consideration" in deciding whether to advertise during the game and what to say  ms. gough said  adding: "we've taken great pains to make sure about our spot. we feel very comfortable with the scrutiny." the ciba vision commercial  to appear in the first quarter  is created by grey worldwide in new york  part of the grey global group  and depicts attractive urbanites enjoying their new contact lenses. another first-time super bowl advertiser  napster inc.  also sought to make sure its commercial  promoting the new napster to go music subscription service  would pass muster in a more fraught environment  said alan cohen  chief marketing officer for napster in los angeles. "we've done our homework on the advertising in terms of talking to consumers about how the message would resonate " mr. cohen said of the spot  produced internally and scheduled for the third quarter. "the advertising is very true to the napster brand " he added. "we have not compromised at all." for all the efforts to avoid offending any of the estimated 140 million americans who may tune in to all or part of the super bowl  some commercials will be more daring. for instance  the battle of the sexes figures in several spots being planned by anheuser-busch for its beer brands. at least two advertisers -- the tabasco brand of hot sauce sold by the mcilhenny company and godaddy.com  a web site registrar owned by the godaddy group -- plan to center their spots on female pulchritude  albeit with tongues firmly in cheeks. "good taste should reign most of the time  but i'm not a prude " said paul c.p. mcilhenny  president and chief executive of the company bearing his surname  which is based in avery island  la. tabasco returns to the super bowl after a seven-year hiatus with a commercial in the third quarter about a bathing beauty's tan lines. the ad was created by the dallas office of ddb worldwide  part of the omnicom group. advertisement "we think our spot is fun and alluring " mr. mcilhenny said  "but doesn't go nearly as far" as those criticized last year did. the primary reason for the reticence  he added  is that his commercial must appeal not only to the men "who use tabasco at the table " but also to the women who buy most food products. "women  they're the gatekeepers  making the decisions at the grocery stores  and we want them to open those gates for us " mr. mcilhenny said. "when you're advertising to young men for beer  you want to push the envelope; we want to help sales in the short run and help brand equity in the long run." several other advertisers are aiming their super bowl spots at women or at a dual audience. they include cosentino u.s.a.  a division of cosentino s.a. of spain  with a commercial featuring athletes for the silestone brand of quartz surfaces  created by freed advertising in sugar land  tex.; diamond of california  with a commercial for emerald nuts that features a father and daughter  with cameo appearances by characters like santa claus  created by goodby  silverstein & partners in san francisco  part of omnicom; and diet pepsi  sold by the pepsi-cola north america division of pepsico  with commercials featuring celebrities like cindy crawford and eva longoria of "desperate housewives " by the ddb new york office. that is not to say the men who compose the majority of the super bowl audience will be ignored. there will be 10 or so spots from anheuser-busch aimed at men for beer brands like budweiser and bud light. and a prescription drug that treats erectile dysfunction  cialis  will return to the super bowl for a second consecutive year  with a spot by grey set to the 1963 rock tune "be my baby." were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,the breakfast meetingwhats making news in media.the komen foundation  the nations leading breast cancer advocacy organization  found itself facing a furor  and a mutiny among its local chapters  as the internet buzzed with reaction to the groups decision to largely end its partnership with planned parenthood. the foundation said the decision had nothing to do with politics or abortion  but critics and a former board member disagreed  jennifer preston and gardiner harris reported. like the internet-led protest against antipiracy legislation  the controversy showed how social networking can change the national conversation with head-snapping speed  they wrote. whats making news in media. the year 2012  or xlvi  if you prefer  will be known for super bowl ad creep  stuart elliott reports. companies used to try to build anticipation  holding back the ads for their debut during the big game; this year  by some estimates  almost half of the 50-plus commercials that are scheduled to appear in the super bowl are already online in one form or another  including anticipated ones from volkswagen and honda. the idea  he writes  is to move the water-cooler conversation that takes place after the game to before the game. on the news that facebook had filed for a multibillion-dollar initial public offering  somini sengupta looks at how mark zuckerberg managed to control so much of the company  almost 60 percent of voting shares. it is more than other tech entrepreneurs typically managed to retain before they went public  including bill gates (49 percent) and the co-founders of google (16 percent each). his strategy  she writes: remain in charge  stave off potential predators and expand the company so quickly that no one can challenge the boss. after reports  including in the times  had donald trump endorsing newt gingrich in time for the nevada caucuses  mr. trump held a news conference to support mitt romney. he was on his best behavior  mark leibovich writes  and said simply: hes not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love. mr. romney may have best summed up the surreal scene  framed by gold plating  at mr. trumps casino: there are some things that you cant imagine happening in your life  he said. and this is one of them.     the fox network announced four new dramas and five new comedies it has ordered for the next television season.readmore     the new york times media news can now be found at the media & advertising section front.readmore     david zinczenko  the former rodale executive who wrote the eat this  not that series  will write three books on exercise  diet and nutrition  and form a new imprint  zinc ink.readmore     the race  ethnicity and culture reporting in nprs series changing races is part of the networks strategy to do better about mirroring america  the chief executive says.readmore     the emmy-winning actor may replace carson daly in a late-night half hour interview program  according to one executive involved in the networks program planning.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,twitter users only really have one kind of filter: people. you follow someone  or you un-follow them. sure  you can search theaggregateof the service  but that is only useful to find larger pieces of information. or you can try to take the time to create a list  but who wants to create and organize a list for each news event you are interested in? these features are mostly unusable due to their limitations  and  as a result  there is no way to filter out current conversations or topics that are taking place within the social network that you really do not care about. as twitter has grown  its lack of filters are starting to become a hindrance for some people. the frustration hit a boiling point for mea few weeks ago when many of my friends and colleagues traipsed off to austin  tex.  to go to the interactive portion of the south by southwest music and media conference and festival.  ive never been to sxsw  and havent really had an urge to go; from what i hear  its arevelryof technology  parties and networking  all of which i can experience in new york. but each year of the conference  when i start up twitter  i am forced to attend sxsw through the people there who message about which conference session they are attending or how many people they were sharing abarbecued rib with. this year i also had to witness every single location-based check-in. to some readers  this might not be a big deal; just turn off the service for the weekend and go about your daily life  you might say. but twitter has become myfire hose for information. i use it to findandshare news stories  see what my friends and co-workers are reading  and find the best of the web at that moment in time. twitter is the first web site i open each morning to check the news; without it  im left to cull for myself  an arduous and overwhelming task given the volume of information flooding the internet. im guessing that for many twitter users  the introduction of apples ipad this weekend was similarly excruciating. almost everyone i follow on twitter who bought an ipad commented about their purchase. and they didnt just talk about the actual transaction at the apple store  but instead announced every banal moment in the experience  from the number of people in line with them  to each application they purchased.for me  it was incredibly entertaining; for many  im sure it wasnt. and the same applies to the superbowl  oscars  michael jacksons death and the tiger woods scandal. some people just arent interested  yet if you want to use twitter  you cant look away  you are forced to rubberneck. as twitters users have multiplied  the service is processing more than 50 million messages a day  compared with 5 000 a day in 2007. if this trend continues  as twitter predicts  the service will likely become noisier and less useful in certain settings. adding a simple mechanism and smart filters that could easily be enabled or disabled would make the service useful all the time  even during the superbowl. follow advertisement 
sports,advertisement feb. 11  2008  tom jolly  sports editor at the times  is answering reader questions feb. 11-15  2008. (he previously answered questions in august 2006.) questions may be sent to askthetimes@nytimes.com.  to move directly to the most recent answer  click here. mr. jolly has been an editor at the times since 1993. he has served as a copy editor  assistant sports editor and assistant news editor. before joining the times he was a reporter and editor at newspapers in ohio  maryland and pennsylvania. other editors have answered questions in this column  including executive editor bill keller  managing editor jill abramson  managing editor john geddes  assistant managing editor glenn kramon  associate managing editor charles strum  obituaries editor bill mcdonald  director of copy desks merrill perlman  metropolitan editor joe sexton  living editor trish hall  investigations editor matthew purdy  national editor suzanne daley  digital news editor jim roberts and culture editor sam sifton. their responses and those of other times editors are on the talk to the newsroom page. these discussions will continue in future weeks with other times editors. the well-traveled journeymen advertisement q. why does the times refer to athletes who play on several different teams as "journeymen"? i realize that it is very common throughout sports reporting but it is incorrect. "journeyman" does not mean someone that makes a lot of journeys  as the nbc television show would have us believe. "journeyman" means: there are several different definitions  but none of them have to do with a person taking journeys.    michael ferrari advertisement a. dear mr. ferrari: this is why i love our readers! right out of the box  a question about word usage. as you note  there are several definitions for "journeyman." the one that applies in this case is the second in webster's: "any sound  experienced  but not brilliant craftsman or performer." in sports  in other words  someone who has built a career playing with different teams without ever rising to stardom. was giants' championship a fluke? q. evidently  no one expected the giants to do as well as they did this year.  there was only one representative from the team in the pro bowl.  was this a one-time fluke for the giants?  can we fully expect the patriots to be gunning for them and anybody else standing in their path next year  to avenge their humiliation and failure to make history? or has the league seen that they aren't invincible?    odehyah gough a. dear ms. gough: i don't think you could ever classify a super bowl championship as a "fluke." the giants beat a lot of good teams to get into the super bowl and then won the title by beating the first team in league history to start the season with an 18-0 record. whether the giants can win it again next season is impossible to say. they're one of the youngest teams in the league and  more important  many of their key players still seem to have a lot of potential for development. but you've got to remember that the n.f.l. has perfected the art of parity  which made the patriots' 18-0 start all the more remarkable but also created the chance for the giants to pull it together at the end of the season and win the super bowl as a wild-card team. if you look at recent super bowl history  you'll see that several recent champions recovered from midseason slumps and finished the season on a hot streak  just as the giants did. that same history shows that it's exceedingly difficult to get back to the super bowl the next season. teams that did well are rewarded with tougher schedules for the next season and teams that did poorly get easier schedules. (just look at what happened to the last two super bowl winners  the colts and the steelers.) the schedule changes and free agency mean that the margin between success and failure is often razor thin. just look at what happened to the jets in the past two seasons. advertisement all of that is what makes the patriots' success over the past few seasons so remarkable. but they've got some work to do  too. many of their key players on defense are old for the n.f.l. and randy moss is a free agent. the bottom line: the n.f.l. has created a system that ensures that each new season will give several teams a chance to be champion. where did the golf scores go? q. why is the new york times omitting golf information (leaderboards  stats  money totals  etc.) from its online edition? this was reported previously  but is now not available. i've already sent two e-mails to your paper (sports and editorial departments) without receiving a response.    mark orman a. i'm afraid i don't have a satisfactory answer for you. our scoreboards are provided by a third party vendor  sportsnetwork. we took down the golf links after last season and the vendor's content (with our navigation and wrapper) should have been updated. but the vendor made some changes as to how they were serving some content and we have not had the opportunity to update our modules with the new links. we'll do what we can to get it updated this week. the sweet science and other combat sports q. in august 2006  you wrote in this forum  "boxing has been in decline for a long time  though  and unless and until a captivating fighter comes on the scene and elevates the sport's profile  i can't see it getting more prominence than it receives now." two questions. first  have you noticed any change? (i suspect not.) second  are you disheartened  because next to baseball  in the 20th century boxing provided material for some of the best sports writing ever? (i would love to pitch you stories on the ufc  but frankly  it lacks the virulent grace of boxing.)   andy bast a. dear mr. bast: if anything  the decline has continued. it has been a long time since i've heard anyone in the general populace talking about boxing  or longing for a showdown between two fighters. advertisement it has been interesting to watch the development of ufc  the ultimate fighting championships  and its related mixed martial arts organizations. one thing about the mma that will be interesting to follow is whether the organizers have learned anything from boxing organizers  who undermined their sport by creating so many competing federations. the result was that it made it more difficult for top fighters to face each other and create the rivalries that helped raise the profile of the sport. however  mma organizers seem to be doing the same thing. as my colleague jason stallman points out: "part of the appeal of mma has always been the notion that it could determine  once and for all  which fighting discipline is the best  pitting an expert of  say  russian sambo against a wrestling specialist  or brazilian jiu-jitsu vs. kickboxing. but as the sport has grown and fractured into various leagues  fans don't necessarily get to see the very best fighters go head-to-head. the most glaring example of this is among the heavyweights. fedor emelianenko is generally regarded as the greatest heavyweight in the world. but he isn't affiliated with ufc  so whoever the ufc proclaims is the heavyweight champion probably really isn't. emelianenko is affiliated with m1 global; until he and ufc reach an agreement  fans are deprived of having a true world champion." kickoff time was off q. how come there wasn't a newspaper in the country that was able to print the actual kickoff time for the super bowl? this year we were told kickoff was at 6:15 p.m. eastern time. reality is the ball wasn't booted off the kicker's foot until after 6:30 p.m. can't your newspaper and others in the united states print the actual time of the kickoff or does the n.f.l. purposely withhold this information so as to garner more viewers for the commercials. i would think a reporter could uncover the accurate kickoff time for readers. the public should be allowed to know the actual start times for any sporting event  no?    joel spitzer a. dear mr. spitzer: one of the lawyers here told me he missed the end of the giants-packers game because he had a plane he had to catch. is that what happened to you? seriously  the n.f.l. listed the kickoff for 6:18 p.m. and to be honest  i'm more curious about how someone came up with that number. i doubt that they were trying to fake us out  but i'm sure you're right that fox didn't mind if it got to run a few extra commercials. believe me  we're always eager for events to end as quickly as possible  we've got deadlines  ya know  and we have no interest in misleading our readers about the start time for a game. a name from the past q. is phil cavaretta still alive and if so  where is he?    ray iannicelli a. dear mr. iannecelli: when last heard from  first baseman phil cavaretta  who played most of his career with the chicago cubs  was living in atlanta. professional sports and charities q. good day from winnipeg  canada  where its a balmy minus somewhere in the mid-30s.  so i cannot be faulted for being a couch potato this past weekend  and watching a few hours of golf. during this weekends telecast of the at&t pebble beach national pro-am this weekend  either jim nance or nick faldo mentioned that golf  as a professional sports organization  donates more to charitable causes than all other professional sports organizations combined!  i would not doubt that to be true  given the nature of golfs advertisements announcing all of the charities they are involved with.  kudos to the pga tour and its managers and members! advertisement now  what does that say about the other professional sports and their charitable efforts? possibly professional football  baseball  basketball and hockey are not far behind. possibly they are just not as showy as the pga.  regardless  given the importance of charitable fund-raising in north america today  how could any of the big 4 professional sports associations not be ashamed that golf shows them up?  available statistics (that is  statistics that i could find through a google search) show that the average golfers purse  outside of tiger woods  is considerably less than the salaries of the average professional sports athlete.  usa todays web site salary databases shows that  in 2006/2007  the top 25 athletes earned salaries (not including endorsements) as follows: hockey:  $8 360 000.00 to $5 750 000.00 nfl:   $30 750 000.00 to $11 100 000.00 baseball:  $23 428 571.00 to $13 250 000.00 basketball:  $21  000  00.00 to $13 260 000.00 statistics from www.pgatour.com show the top 25 golfers well below these figures  with the top earnings at $10 867 052.00 to $2 483.146.00.  no doubt  the big 4 are big givers.  and surely many athletes are less open about the large sums they do contribute; it is not so seemly to attract attention for the good works one pursues. but less than the pga combined? no doubt  our society needs leadership when it comes to charitable giving  and we should only commend the pga for doing just that.  the big 4 need to learn from the pga  and start to brag.  send the message that some of their income that the fans generate goes to support x charity.  send the message that those of us who support professional sports can be involved too  and heres how.  leadership is needed from the big 4!  they need to step up and surpass the pga  given the incredible multiples that each of these leagues generates over and above professional golf. the new york times has clout!!  how can you help? postscript daniel kaplan  an editor at sportsbusiness journal  was reading this q&a and offers this regarding the pga and charity: "the reason the pga donates more than others is the events are charities themselves.  it would be as if a team was a charity itself.  it's not that the pga has better charities  the reason is it is a charity." as kaplan points out  last year the pga topped $1 billion in total giving  a number that stretches back to the 1930s.   gary ross  winnipeg  manitoba a. dear mr. ross: congratulations on the weather. it's frigid and snowing here. very winnipeg-like  i'd imagine. at any rate  we periodically report on the charitable endeavors and/or lack thereof concerning athletes  but your analysis is interesting and perhaps something we'll look into further. however  we're not in a position to force anyone to make contributions  regardless of our "clout " and i can't imagine anyone would think it would be responsible for us to do so. most professional sports have their own charitable programs and probably could provide you with information about them if you so desire. artificial turf on high school fields q. i'd like to ask you what your opinion is of the local divisive and insidious issue of installing artificial turf and lights on school and town fields. maybe it's happening in your community or a nearby community. advertisement in my town of bernardsville  n.j.  the issue is the installation of artificial turf on the high school field  with the lights being promised in the future. in our town  unlike many other towns  in the 1950s we didn't decide to relocate the high school from the center of town to the outskirts  in anticipation of future population growth. the high school remained in a nice residential neighborhood and expanded the infrastructure there. these neighbors are leading the opposition of the installation. in west caldwell  there was a referendum that halted the installation of artificial turf on the high school field. in madison  this issue is two-fold: installation of artificial turf on the town's field and installation of lights on the high school field in the neighboring town of chatham  which borders residents of madison. in chatham also  neighbors are opposing the installation of lights at another school field in chatham. in the communities where the fields are located near residential neighborhoods  the issue is two-fold: "location  location  location" and possible future environmental  health  expense  and playing condition concerns vs "kids organized sports  kids organized sports  kids organized sports."  in other communities  where a neighborhood is not affected  the latter set of concerns are being raised which are pitted against proponents of kids organized sports.  this latter set of concerns are of recent origin  with articles in the ny times in the fall  bloomberg news in december  announcement by david beckham in the summer  and the ny giants vs san francisco 49ers game on oct 21  2007 (during which the fox commentators discussed the poor condition of turf field at giant stadium during the first half). i'm sure you understand the divisive nature of the issue. the insidious nature of the issue comes from the fact that it involves kid organized sports. unlike when i was growing up  when we had few organized sports and had pick up games instead  kid organized sports now have a choke hold on many families and are touted as a cure to the ills of computer games  the internet  unsocial behavior  etc. it would take a very special athlete to speak out against artificial turf and lights. they would have to go against the wishes of their coaches and fellow athletes. a parent would be also reluctant  fearful of the impact that it might have on their child. because it involves kids and because it is threatening  inhibiting  and ostracizing  it is an insidious issue to me. ironically  in our town  i believe that there isn't a real need for the artificial turf....that simply revising the schedule of the games on our fields and doing good field maintenance will result in restoring the fields to being in good playing condition. but i have to battle to convince people of this.    pete thurlow  bernardsville  n.j. a. dear mr. thurlow: we've written quite a bit about the zealousness with which many adults promote "youth" sports  in particular  you can search for articles by bill pennington. issues about lighting and artificial turf for high school fields can be hot-button topics  as they apparently are in your town. i don't see how there can be a blanket answer for either matter. it obviously depends on the neighborhood and the finances of the school district. is the dog show a sport? q. if the dog show is covered by the sports section  why not the miss america pageant  the cat show  "american idol " chess and bowling?  (at least chess is a competition with an endurance aspect to it  and bowling requires an athletic talent regarding a ball.  reading the times  one would have no idea as to the identity of the successors to ray bluth  don carter  carmen salvino and dick weber.)  or n.h.l. box scores?  (the whole world are not fans of the rangers  devils and icelanders.)  give me a break.  the dog show no more belongs in the pages of the times sports section than coverage of a debutante ball. use the space for real sports!   dan gantt a. dear mr. gantt: my goodness  i didn't realize there were such rules about what does and doesn't go in the sports section! come on  the dog show is only a couple of days each february. most readers love our coverage  judging by web traffic and most e-mailed lists. you're right that there's a big old world of sports  and we try to address that by looking for opportunities to write in-depth features  profiles and long pieces about interesting aspects of that world. as you'll see if you follow this conversation over the next couple of days  a lot of people would like us to provide more coverage of the sports they care about most. we have limited resources  though  and our mission is to pick and choose the subjects that we think will be of the most interest to the most readers. by the way  you might be surprised at the coverage we've given bowling. you can check it out on the times topics page for bowling. advertisement which is the greater transgression? q. it always seemed to me that the football cheating scandal this year was in some ways worse than the steroid issue in baseball. the patriots were caught cheating this season  apparently had done so before and still were allowed to play in the postseason. though it was fun to watch their loss in the last game (cheaters never prosper)  they should have never been allowed to advance into the playoffs and super bowl. while i haven't yet figured out all the ways that this was worse than the situation in baseball i do know one way that it is. it is worse in that it was allowed by the american public to stand without appropriate penalty and it was not mentioned and covered enough by the media as the season wore on. undefeated in regular season? really? can i get an asterisk? compared to the steroid issue in baseball it was covered as if it were simply one missed call and not total corruption of the game. why does pete rose remain banned from cooperstown with bill belichek lauded still and "in" the game? is baseball that much better of a game that we expect so much more? i've always thought so  say it is so mr. jolly!    richard paul hebert  new orleans a. dear mr. hebert: your overall question  is baseball held to a different standard than the n.f.l.  is one that our columnists have explored several times  most recently by george vecsey. it is fascinating  isn't it  that there's such angst about barry bonds and roger clemens while the drug-related suspensions of shawne merriman and rodney harrison elicit barely a shrug. or  as you point out  that there wasn't more of an uproar about the patriots' cheating investigation and the n.f.l.'s handling of it  at least until senator arlen specter got involved. one thing i've got to clarify  though  is that there was a significant difference between the transgressions of rose and belichick. as judy battista reported  belichick spied on other teams in an effort to gain an advantage. as murray chass reported  rose bet on the outcome of games involving a team he was managing and his pattern of gambling sent signals to bookies and others who knew of his betting when he thought his team could win and when it couldn't. women's basketball coverage q. why can't the times treat women athletes on terms equal with men?  for more than two years i have been frustrated to see the differences in how you handle college basketball scores according to gender.  for men  we have ap rankings  and the ability to go back for an entire month to examine any prior result.  for women  we get big red color bars  no indication of national status and absolutely no chance to find out what happened yesterday unless we get up before the sun.  we need a title ix for sports reporting.    karl m. johnson  m.d. q. i've noticed a significant increase in your coverage of women's basketball. first  thank you! second  what prompted the change?    helen wheelock  woodside  queens a. dear dr. johnson and ms. wheelock: see what i meant about readers viewing us differently  depending on their perspective? advertisement dr. johnson  your complaint about our coverage of women's basketball refers to our web site and is related to the earlier question about the availability of golf scores. those statistics are provided by a third party vendor; we simply don't have the personnel to be able to keep up with all of the statistical information in sports. unfortunately  the amount of data that's available relates to the perceived interest in each sport. like it or not  women's basketball has not yet achieved parity with men's basketball. as for ms. wheelock's observation  i confess that you're keeping closer track of that than i am. we look for good stories in all sports and even if women's basketball isn't yet on par with the men's game in popularity  it's got a significant following and lots of interesting topics. by the way  both of you might be interested to know that i heard an espn radio commentator saying he can't stand women's basketball and that there was no way the new york times was going to force it on him. again  it all depends on your perspective. a little baseball terminology q. in baseball  what is a walkoff home run?    bonnie burdick a. dear ms. burdick: once you know the meaning  it's one of the most straightforward expressions in sports: a game-winning home run that is hit in the bottom half of the final inning  causing the fielders to walk off to the locker room. what about soccer? q. i have been disappointed in the coverage the times has devoted to soccer for a long time. what should we in the soccer community be doing to encourage you to give more column inches to soccer?    jack huckel  director of museum and archives  national soccer hall of fame and museum  oneonta  n.y. a. dear mr. huckel: your lament is familiar. (and repeated in different forms above and probably below.) there are so many sports and we have only so many resources to cover them with. however  i'd encourage you to check out our lively goal blog  maintained primarily by jack bell and jeffrey marcus with contributions from around the globe. it's got a robust following and may surprise you with its depth and breadth. advertisement the daily miracle q. could you please describe how the new york times sports section is puttogether on a typical evening in the newsroom and how various responsibilities are divided? i'm sure it's a fascinating process requiring a good deal of planning.    bob liepa a. dear mr. liepa: sometimes  it's a piece of cake. sometimes  it's a small miracle. sometimes we say  "if readers could see this  they wouldn't believe it ..." seriously  thanks for this question. it gives me a chance to say a little bit about the fantastic people i'm fortunate enough to work with. keep in mind  we're not putting the newspaper together every day  we're putting a web page and a newspaper together every day. it's not the same thing and it requires a lot of choreography with our reporters  columnists  editors  photographers  web producers  graphic artists  art directors and page designers. on the web  we've got blogs  video  audio  slide shows and other web-exclusive elements as well as the stories that go in the paper. much of the planning and implementation for the web is handled by jeffrey marcus  our supremely talented and dedicated daytime producer. we've also got a crew of editors who start early and help orchestrate what stories will go onto the web and into the paper each day. others come in as the day evolves to edit stories  write headlines and picture captions and handle the production of the newspaper end of things. in truth  of course  what we do isn't confined to individual days; it involves long-term planning. the 24-7 nature of our web site means that we've broken the old day-to-day cycle that producing only a morning newspaper once created. our coverage of the clemens hearings is an example of that. our reporters duff wilson and michael schmidt have been leading the way in covering that story  breaking news on the web day after day and  at the end of each day  distilling it all into stories for what the business-side folks now refer to as our print product but which we still like to call the newspaper. advertisement on tuesday  harvey araton wrote a web-only column on three questions he would ask clemens if he were a congressman at the hearing. today  alan schwarz blogged from the hearing to give readers a live running assessment of what was going on. at the same time  we provided steaming video provided by a.p. shortly after the hearings end  our reporters will post their first reports of the hearings  then they'll get to work on the stories they'll write for the newspaper. if they encounter more news along the way  they'll update the web versions of their articles. separately  editors sandy keenan  jay schreiber  jason stallman and mike abrams will be planning the rest of the day  both in regard to what else we'll put on the web and what will go in the paper. the trick there is that  unlike the web  we have a limited amount of space for what goes into the newspaper  roughly the equivalent of six full pages worth of articles  photos and other information. because of that  we have to prioritize which articles go when and how long certain articles will be. that equation is constantly changing  of course  because news develops in unforeseen ways. in the afternoon and early evening a fresh crew of editors led by carl nelson  jim luttrell  toni monkovic and rich ehrhard come in and take over the process of putting the paper together. there are four deadlines each night  9:30 for the first national edition  10:30 for the first city edition  11:30 for the second edition of both papers and 12:30 for the final city edition. obviously  live events are ending throughout that time period and depending on the significance of those events  our front page  we call it our dress page  may be torn up and redone  often on the fly  which also means inside pages must be redrawn as well. it's often an amazing sight to see and on nights when big events are happening  like super bowl sunday  it's marvelous to behold. he shoots! he scores! but who knows? q. why doesn't the times have beat reporters for the islanders and the devils that cover every regular-season game  as it does for other local teams?  advertisement   h. schnall a. dear mr. schnall: i'll recast a respone i gave the last time i was in the "talk to the newsroom" forum: your email is one of several from readers who would like to see more coverage of a particular team or sport. one of our challenges is deciding how best to allocate our resources  both in terms of the number of reporters we have and in the space available in the sports section. decisions on what we are going to cover are constantly under discussion and change by the hour  depending on news. remember also that we are an international news organization  responsible for covering not only the local teams but news of significance around the world. in other words  we have to make some tough choices. our approach is to cover the teams that have the biggest following. but while the lockout may have helped solve the n.h.l.'s financial problems  it had the unintended result of showing that hockey's following is significantly behind that of football  baseball and basketball. that puts hockey in the category of sports where we look for opportunities to do the big stories that we think will be of interest  or use  to the most readers. in recent weeks  we've done articles on alex ovechkin  jaromir jagr  andthe phoenix coyotes  as well as our weekly slap shot notebook and the slap shot blog. strategy vs. personalities q. sports reporting has become more focused on personalities than an analysis of the game. while the internet is always available for supplementary coverage  what would be your thoughts of increasing overage of coaching strategies/tactics?   atul chugh a. dear atul chugh: our goal is to provide a mix of articles about personalities  issues  game stories and analysis. we pick our spots for all of those kinds of articles because we want to provide our readers a range of coverage. as i hope you saw in our coverage of the super bowl  we provide analysis when a large number of people are interested in a game. if you follow the work of reporters like judy battista  john branch  howard beck  tyler kepner and ben shpigel  you'll almost always see that they regularly take an analytical look at the events they are covering. questionable call in super bowl? q. please help me with a rules clarification from the super bowl. how could the coach of the patriots throw a challenge flag on a play that did not have a penalty call  resulting in a 12-player on the field penalty assessment? crux: the refs did not call a foul/penalty  so there was in essence  nothing to challenge. it appears that the coach took it upon himself to challenge a "non-call"  and where does that get us?     clark hays  portland  ore. a. dear mr. hays: the n.f.l. rules allow for challenges for detectable infractions  including the number of players on the field. answer advertisement what about the n.f.l.? q. i have read  and heard  mounting criticism of both the national football league and the union that represents its players  both active and retired  for how health care is inadequately addressed and too poorly funded by the league and union  especially for retirees. there has been a tremendous amount of coverage generated by baseball's steroid scandal  but  in my opinion  far less efforts and resources dedicated to a problem that continues to go unaddressed by both the league and the players union. why?     jon marino a. dear mr. marino: it's true that the n.f.l. disability issue hasn't received as much attention as steroids  but we have covered it quite extensively as the articles linked here indicate. as those same articles indicate  the league and the players union have addressed the disability issue in several ways  although the retired players continue to lobby for further redress. there are several reasons that the steroids issue receives more attention  among them that using them is cheating  the belief that many professional sports still don't have adequate testing programs  the concern that young athletes will believe that steroids are necessary to succeed in sports. n.f.l. and players union agree to alter disability plan congress scolds n.f.l. and union chiefs lineman tries to spark generosity congress considers action to help former n.f.l. players rehab plan announced for n.f.l.'s ex-players study of ex-n.f.l. players ties concussion to depression risk ex-cowboy johnston backs ailing retirees owners add $10 million for ailing ex-players  where is senator mitchell? q. my question: roger clemens and his lawyers are basically saying that brian mcnamee lied because he was pressured to do so by the investigators. at what point does senator george mitchell get his back up over the fact that these guys are calling his report corrupt? he's been awfuly quiet about this so far.     brad smith a. dear mr. smith: your question goes to the heart of why the house committee on oversight and government reform held its hearing on wednesday. the testimony by and about roger clemens and brian mcnamee is expected to help resolve the question of who is telling the truth on the matter. and even if it doesn't  all indications are that justice department will follow up with its own investigation. investigative reporting in sports q. first off  thanks for the great sports section. i noticed that sometimes it seems that the sports section does a kind of investigative reporting. i think you actually had a lot to do with ending the jets "gate" fiasco at  giants stadium due to your exposure of it  and i think you weighed in heavily on michael vick. how do you find and how do you approach these more controversial stories?  advertisement   bernie langs  new providence  n.j. a. mr. langs: thank you for the compliments. it's gratifying to see that you've noticed some of the work we're proudest of and nice to see some recognition for our smart  hard working reporters and editors. they're the people who come up with the best ideas and stories  the best of which generally involve thinking outside the norm in sports. i have to credit one of the paper's assistant managing editors  glenn kramon  for coming up with the best definition of how to recognize a story that deserves special attention: if the subject matter makes you mad  there's a good chance it will make a lot of our readers mad  too. that certainly fits the description for the stories you mention  as well as others  including alan schwarz's fine series on the long-term affects of concussions  which you can see at this times topics page. in retrospect  i wish i had had more foresight about the vick story. like many people  i believed his initial claim that although he owned the house  he didn't know what was going on there. the lesson on that story is that even if you're late to get on it  you can shed light on the subject  as juliet macur did last week with her sensitive story on the fate of the dogs that were confiscated from vick and as katie thomas did wednesday with her story on how cockfighting is viewed in an altogether different light in the dominican republic. the gate d story you mentioned is a great example of a reporter looking beyond the "expected" boundaries. none of us were aware of the harassment that had become a halftime tradition at jets games until our reporter  dave picker  was stretching his legs after the second quarter and heard a roar from the concourse. he asked a security guard what was going on and the guard explained. dave took it from there  even ending up in the holding cell under the stadium when some guards took offense to his inquiries. as you point out  the uproar that resulted from his article resulted in some substantial changes in the way the stadium authority handled the halftime activities. all of those stories called attention to issues that stirred the passions of readers in exactly the way glenn kramon describes. replacing selena roberts q. now that you've lost the particular voice and reportage that was provided by selena roberts  does the sports section have any plans to replace her with another individual?    charles rosenberger a. dear mr. rosenberger: selena's voice is unique and finding a suitable replacement won't be easy  but we will. advertisement the duke lacrosse case q. when the duke lacrosse "rape" case first erupted  the new york times sports section was one of the leading cheerleaders for the conviction and slandering of the duke team as a whole and the three charged players.  when the charges imploded  the players exonerated  and michael nifong disbarred   the sports section and "pundits" remained steadfastly silent.  since you are the chief editor  one must assume that you led and approved of all the reporting (and non-reporting) and the commentary (however incorrect and one-sided). question:  as the editor of the sports section how do you justify your behavior in toto?    rex avery a. dear mr. avery: first  let me clarify that our reporters remained involved in the coverage of the duke case throughout. the placement of the articles moved into the national section of the paper once it became a court case  as is generally the case with such stories  including the rape cases against kobe bryant and mike tyson. we've written stories about the team since it was reinstated and covered its run to the title game last season. as far as our coverage of the case itself  if the essence of your question is whether i feel good about it  the answer is that i very much regret my failure to recognize that we were dealing with a rogue prosecutor and that the university had compounded his bravado by overreacting to the initial reports about the case. i don't recall another instance of a university canceling the season of a team that was a contender for a national championship. nor do i recall a similar example of a prosecutor launching such an aggressively wrongheaded investigation. but the bottom line is that i'd do some things differently  and that knowledge gained by hindsight has informed our approach to other stories since then. clemens on capitol hill q. what procedure is it that allows roger clemens to have private meetings with 25 politicians who are on a committee that is investigating him?  it's very bizarre.  is the procedure available to anyone  like me  for instance?  what if i had some things i wanted to discuss with our washington legislators; would i be able to do so  privately  in advance of an investigation of myself  with no taping or otherwise official record of any kind?    harold winshel  abdington  pa. a. dear mr. winshel: your question is one that has been asked by a lot of people  and addressed in news articles by duff wilson and a column by murray chass. it's often puzzling to see how politicians behave when athletes appear before them  and it's not the first time that we've seen this kind of idolatry in washington. a similar kind of behavior was evident during the steroids hearings in 2005. as duff reported on wednesday  there are some boundaries and some in congress may have crossed them in accepting autographs from clemens. advertisement quiet  please! q. please explain why the tennis associations have not yet after all the years ofcomplaints  put a stop to the screaming and screeching during matches. surelythey can't all be deaf!     jaybee a. dear jaybee: i'm afraid that's a question for the tennis associations  not me. have you considered ear plugs? or perhaps an ipod? notre dame home basketball games q. how obscene is it that a college basketball team like notre dame  with a record of 18-4  has played 17 games at home  and 5 on the road?  they have an overwhelming advantage there  while other teams have played fewer games at home than on the road and their records show it.  obscene might be a bit strong.  another question:  if the catcher is allowed to block home plate against an oncoming runner  the catcher  let's say being 220 pounds  wrapped in leather and fiberglass shielding  the runner   a flyweight 165 pounds  why can't a second baseman guard second against an advancing runner the same way?  huh?  also  how many doubleheaders are split  and how many swept-percentage wise.  i'll be sitting by my computer waiting like a lovesick schoolgirl.     charles f. singewald a. dear mr. singewald you're being pretty liberal with that invitation to ask "questions." in truth  i don't know the answer to your second and third questions  but the answer to the first one is simple and traditional for big-time basketball programs  and football programs  too  for that matter. schools like notre dame can invite lesser programs to come get beat up on their court in exchange for a nice payday. that helps notre dame pad its victory total before play begins in the big east conference and by going .500 there  it can still make it into the n.c.a.a. tournament. getting an edge q. tom  i would like to play for either the yankees or mets. do you think reading the new york times would give me an advantage?    john brady a. how could it hurt? the greatest upset in super bowl history? q. one last statement on the "greatest upset in superbowl history."  it wasn't.  what is so surprising about a team that lost by 3 points when it had nothing on the line but pride beating its opponent when they met again in the super bowl?  didn't surprise me one bit.  the pats could have just as easily had three losses going into the super bowl (giants  ravens  eagles).  the biggest upset was joe namath's jets beating the baltimore colts.  that was one league upsetting the other league.  agree?

   manny mejia  sarasota  fla. a. see above in regard to different interests and limited resources. again  we pick our spots. brad spurgeon  our colleague at the international herald tribune  does a fine job covering the sport throughout the year and we look for moments to highlight it. we wrote a fair amount about lewis hamilton and we also covered the mclaren cheating scandal. for a better sense of our auto racing coverage check out the times topics page  quaintly named automobile racing. advertisement why so critical of rodriguez? q. why is it that there appears to be a bias on the part of several of your sports columnists against alex rodriguez?  he has won the m.v.p. award in two years as a yankee and has performed (other than playoffs) extremely well.    martin shapiro a. dear mr. shapiro: alex rodriguez has a complicated relationship with the media  fans and even some teammates. yes  he has taken some shots  he's nicely reimbursed for his trouble  of course  but he has also been defended by columnists like george vecsey and harvey araton. winter sports schedules q. how do i find the schedules for ice skating  especially figure skating?  ggymnastics?  cross-country skiing?  downhill skiing?  the pipe  and all other winter sports that  i'm missing right now? reading the results of an event in the times the day after the event drives me crazy!!!!  i want to be able to find the schedule of events before the event has happened so i can watch it on tv! would really  really appreciate your help in this!    louise m. young a. dear ms. young: we used to publish an extensive list of sports on television  but the expansion of cable programming made it impossibly unwieldy. the good news is that search engines are a wonderful thing. most of the information you're interested in is available on web sites that are devoted to individual sports. to get you started  here's a link to the television schedule for u.s. figureskating events: www.usfigureskating.org/event_tv_schedule.asp. the future of sportswriting q. some commentary on contemporary sports journalism has leveled the critique that we focus too much on statistics  reprehensible behavior and record-keeping. there is  of course  a use for the coverage of such subjects (they are a reality  after all)  but  i'm wondering: if you share a concern for the future of sportswriting  what kind of stories would you like to see more of?    michael rowe  minneapolis a. dear mr. rowe: as near as i can tell  the commentary you're referring to reflects a longing for the days before sports lost its innocence. like it or not  sports is a big business these days. with that comes money  power  celebrity and  often enough  corruption. consider the news from the past few months: an n.b.a. referee is arrested for gambling  the tour de france is torn asunder by drug use  the mitchell report opens a window on steroids use in baseball  the patriots are caught spying on their opponents  etc. etc. the n.f.l. is probably the most illuminating example of why things have changed. many of the top coaches and players are inaccessible  either literally  hiding in the training room when the media is around  or figuratively  speaking in belichickese when they do talk to reporters. the patriots' spying investigation is an example of how the league works. the n.f.l. conducted an investigation that it refused to describe in any meaningful way  destroyed whatever evidence it had without explanation  heavily penalized the patriots and then essentially said: "trust us. we took care of it." for months  league officials refused to discuss it further  until senator arlen specter raised a ruckus just before the super bowl. all of that only raised more questions  of course  but the n.f.l. is rich and powerful enough that its leaders don't feel the need to answer to anyone who can't threaten to take away their antitrust exemption. i don't want to sound cynical or cold-hearted  but as red smith used to say  it's not our job to "god up" athletes and i'm sure he'd agree that it's not our job to "god up" sports in general. the athletes and the games they play provide a tremendous amount of entertainment value  but we've got to cover them with our eyes wide open  in the same way we would approach any other aspect of journalism. college athletes and class time q. for many years  college presidents have come out against a college football playoff because of the lost class time and the length of the season.  in view of this perception  has anyone ever done an analysis of how much class time a college football player misses as against a college basketball player for the length of their seasons?  in view of the fact that college basketball teams play many of their games during the week and travel all across the country  i would assume that they miss far more classes than their football students.     mitchell h. pally  melville  n.y. a. dear mr. pally: interesting observation  but as pete thamel wrote a little more than a year ago  athletes in division i sports devote such an enormous amount of time to their sports that the latest "arms race" involves the expansion of tutoring services to help them stay eligible. the bigger issue about a college football playoff game is that the bowl system is so entrenched and profitable that many in the sport are wedded to it. that's why the concept of the plus-one playoff gained so much attention; it would add a game to the system rather than taking one away. 'world champions' in what world? q. greetings from nara  japan. i was wondering why the new york times  all other media outlets and athletes continue to call u.s national champions "world" champions. after the super bowl  michael strahan talks about winning the "world" championship. it is said routinely about champions from the world series and the n.b.a.. the united states barely advanced out of the first round of the world baseball classic almost two years ago. the w.b.c. was won by japan  with two major leaguers  defeating cuba  with no major leaguers. the world basketball championship was won by argentina  while the united states finished third  which was its place in the last olympics  which followed a sixth in the previous world championship. in both sports  the united states had the opportunity to send its best players. i've traveled widely and have never heard anybody other than north americans talk about the n.f.l. or super bowl. it is a sport with 100 percent american teams playing in 100 percent american cities and played by close to 100 percent american players. how does that qualify as a "world" championship? the president and chief executive of the boston red sox recently visited japan and said that the world champion red sox  etc.  etc.  rather insulting since he was standing with people who are truly the world champions  they won it on the field. i guess they should be talking about their world champion chunichi dragons. this issue doesn't seem to concern or bother americans  but the people i know from outside the united states find it laughable at the self importance/parochialism. my aussie friends would never dream of calling the aussie rules champs the  champions of the world; canadian football league champions are awarded the grey cup and never talk about being world champs and certainly the premier league soccer winners are just that  champions of english soccer.    bruce picken  nara  japan a. dear mr. picken: first  congratulations! you're the leader in the clubhouse as the most distant e-mailer. and  yes  you're right  americans do tend to get provincial about their status in the sports world. but you're also right that the recent performance of the u.s. basketball team helped quiet some of that talk  as did the u.s. baseball team's failure to even make the semifinals in the world baseball classic. our policy is not to refer to anyone as a world champion unless they truly are. that doesn't mean we won't use a quote in which someone says they're the "world champions of pro football" or something like that  if the rest of the quote seems meaningful enough. but you won't see us referring to the giants that way. the greatest of the greats q. hello there! why does it seem that the media wants to make (just about) every player and team the best that ever was? for the past 15 or so years every other guy was the "next" michael jordan. why is jordan the best ever? what about all the other great players that deserve the same billing? is it because they're not media darlings? what happened to bill russell  kareem abdul-jabbar  oscar robertson  magic johnson  larry bird  just to name a few  is it championships? how come everybody makes brett favre the best or one of the best when he's not even the best packer ever? how come nobody talks anymore of the players of yesteryear? how about bart starr? five championships.   otto graham? doesn't jim brown have five or six m.v.p.'s? and so does johnny unitas. why are all the conversations about favre's three? i guess i just wouldn't put jordan at the top  certainly top 10  favre ... maybe top 10 quarterbacks.    alejandro prego a. you mean like calling the super bowl winner "the world champion"? and speaking of that  don't you think that catch david tyree made was the best in super bowl history? and that eli manning put together the most remarkable game-winning drive you've ever seen? yes  we americans have developed a fondness for christening things as the greatest this and the best that. in the media  that's partly driven by the notion that if you call enough athletes or teams "the best ever " sooner of later one of them will be and you can claim you were the first to notice. (on the bet that the rest of us will forget all the times you were wrong.) we try to resist and for the most part i think we do  but ... we ... are ... human. room for comments from readers? q. the times has done a better job in recent years of reaching out to readers and providing multiple forums for their voices to be heard. the newspaper's sunday sports section prints brief letters on topics of the day  but does not offer space for a longer letter. would you consider running one 250- to 500-word piece each sunday from a reader who wishes to delve a little deeper into an issue and can provide thoughtful analysis or a fresh point of view?    james g. kempton  nanuet  n.y. a. we receive many over-the-transom offerings from readers and occasionally publish them. the web site also allows for longer comments from readers. there's cold and then there's cold q. there was much attention during the giants-packers game to the below-zero temperature and comparison to the famous 14 below zero packers-cowboys ice bowl  but there was a significant difference that should have been observed by reporters.  lambeau field is now superbly heated from below by piping that circulates fluid that is over 100 degrees fahrenheit. the field did not freeze during the contest (which helped to make for such skillful football).  but no one reporting observed that the heated field had a direct ameliorating impact upon the air temperatures felt by the players at field level.  while those sleeveless linemen were indeed tough as nails  they were being warmed by constant contact with a field surface radiating heat probably at the level of 50 degrees fahrenheit. did you have a reporter at field level and did he or she in fact notice this impact?    eric m. rosenberg a. do i detect a product endorsement here? we did not have a reporter at field level  but our photographers noticed the difference. that's probably why players didn't get frostbite as players in the famous ice bowl game did. rutgers and the time-space continuum q. can anything be done to give rutgers women their victory over tennessee? for 0.2 seconds to take 1.3 seconds is denying einstein.    bill storrer a. it doesn't look like it  but take heart: perhaps it will inspire the scarlet knights the next time they play the vols  and if they meet again it will mean more. look how the giants handled their rematch. illegal substances of yesteryear q. could we see an article on babe ruth  the asterisk  and the consumption of illegal performance enhancing substances? alcohol during prohibition. not this idiotic steroid stuff.    john dodds a. i know it can seem tiresome and i think most of us would be glad if we didn't need to write any further about steroids and performance-enhancing drugs. look  if it wasn't against the law or against the rules  if it was considered good for you  we'd no doubt write a lot less about it. but then you read stuff like george vecsey's column a few days ago about frank and brenda marrero  whose son efrain ended up dead after using steroids in an effort to emulate his sports heroes. you think about how the times and other publications write about the workout regimens of top athletes and you realize that we do so because people want to believe they can look like those athletes if they copy the workouts. and if we think they're that eager to copy those workouts  especially if they're young and impressionable  what do you think the chances are that some of them will follow the example of the athlete who took an occasional injection to help build that zero-percent body-fat body with bulging biceps and six-pack abs? ask frank or brenda marrero. a question of motives q. with regard to the clemens-mcnamee hearing and investigation  why is no one examining the issue of motive? as i understand it  mcnamee has nothing to personally gain from naming clemens and adding him to his list  i.e.  he's not being paid or being given immunity on a "per head" basis; on the other hand  clemens is facing the loss of his reputation  entry into the hall of fame  an asterisk by his records  possible return of one or more cy youngs  etc. so it seems that clemens is the only one who has something to gain by lying.    jim polan a. dear mr. polan: your point is one we've made many times and it's buttressed by the fact that both andy pettitte and chuck knoblauch acknowledged that mcnamee told the truth about them. given that  the next point about motive becomes why would mcnamee tell the truth about pettitte and knoblauch but lie about clemens? clemens and his camp contend that mcnamee has lied in the past  including in an article in the new york times when he said it was unfair to hard-working ball players that people were suggesting that they were using steroids. they say he lied on those occasions and is lying now. if you were inclined to believe mcnamee before the congressional hearing  you're probably inclined to believe him still. if you were inclined to believe clemens  you're probably sticking with his story. we may only get to the truth if there is a perjury investigation  and even then there are no assurances that we'll be sure. to vote or not to vote? q.  why aren't baseball writers at the times allowed to vote in the baseball writers  hall of fame selection process and other awards?  is the new york vote thus forfeited or does the times (or the bbwa) re-allocate those votes to a new yorker?  would derek jeter have won the m.v.p. in 2006 had the times's writers been allowed to vote? i've been a yankee fan since 1956 and i get down to seattle every time they play there.  the new york times is my no. 1 source of new york yankee information and features. play ball!     john m. sweeney  anchorage  alaska q. hello. thanks for taking questions. could you address the times's insistence that its sportswriters not vote in hall of fame balloting? i'm particularly interested in voting for baseball  but i'm sure your paper's policy applies to all sports. i think it cheats the sportswriter  who probably wonders why the times doubts his integrity. but also the whole idea is that players are elected by sportswriters  so how could there not be an input from the great new york times? don't you  as editor  feel your own paper and writers get short shrift here? do you believe the issue can or should be revisited?    ron grunberg a. to the contrary  i don't think reporters have any business voting on the hall of fame or any awards or polls  in sports  theater or any other subject. we're in the business of covering the news  not making it. there are plenty of other people who can vote. if we trust the public to elect our politicians  i can't fathom why we can't trust people to vote on these other awards  except  of course  for the vested interest of those who now control the voting. heck  the public picked carrie underwood  why not let the people decide if mark mcgwire belongs in the hall of fame? text 1-1-1-1? overlooked for hall of fame? q. what is your take on why tom flores is not in the n.f.l. hall of fame? he is the first hispanic coach to win a super bowl  and he won two. madden won one and got in. flores still owns the raider passing record of most tds in a game. he does a great deal of community work. and last i heard he was in the raider radio network don't know if it's still true. he has written the best-selling book for coaches  a real classic. and he was the first man to have four super bowl rings  one as a player  one as an assistant coach and two as head coach. why has he been overlooked?    bob o'connor a. every hall of fame has its share of people who are overlooked for reasons that are inexplicable. a few questions ago i was joking (sort of) about letting the public text in votes for the hall of fame or other awards  horrors! but your question shows that the current system isn't exactly perfect. q. as a new yorker now living in denver (no new yorker is ever a former new yorker)  im always amused and bemused by the wail and cry around n.f.l. hall of fame election time about why more denver broncos arent in the hall of fame. can you explain the selection process and  as an aside  can you explain why joe klecko not only isnt in the hall but isnt even mentioned as a finalist?     jimmy hayde  denver a. yet another question about unfairness in the hall of fame selection process. could this be the start of a grassroots movement? i can't tell you why klecko hasn't been a serious candidate for selection  but the pro football hall of fame web site has a thorough explanation of how that process works. how will fans react to pettitte? q. how will we ever dissect the clemens saga and how do you think yankeefans will react to pettitte in april?    ray  wallington  n.j. a. dear ray: as noted earlier  it will probably take a perjury investigation to figure out who was telling the truth in the clemens saga and even then we may not get a conclusive answer. my guess is that pettitte will be embraced by yankees fans. his admission in the wake of the mitchell report  even if it turned out to be incomplete  won a lot of good will from the people i've talked to. why no n.h.l. box scores? q. re:  hockey coverage. i  am certain  your answer to "why no beat coverage for the islanders and the devils" will apply to the non-listing of hockey box scores for  the rest of the n.h.l.  but why not throw us a bone  and at least give box scores for the  rest of the league?    jamie fenwick a. dear jamie: we'd love to be able to provide all of the statistical data from every sports event  and we do  on the web site. as you undoubtedly know  the paper got smaller a few months ago and when that happened our news hole shrunk by about 10 percent  or roughly half a page. when we learned that was coming  we started taking a hard look at what made our section the most distinctive and what we could afford to cut back on. clearly  the original content produced by our columnists and reporters is what makes our section distinctive. just as clearly  with so much statistical information now so readily available on the internet  agate was no longer as valuable as it once was. a full list of hockey box scores is equivalent to one news article. we're confident we're serving the greater good of most readers by choosing the news article over agate. partisan nature of congressional hearing q. it appeared that at wednesday's hearing representatives doing the questioning were split along party lines. democrats went after clemens. republicans tried to take apart mcnamee. were you surprised by that?  a. the partisanship was a surprise. it was something alan schwarz addressed in his live blogging of the hearing and that duff wilson further explored in a story that appeared on the web on thursday evening and in the paper on friday. as wilson's story says  the partisanship arose mostly because many republicans didn't want to be seen as supporting what they regard as the prosecutorial approach of the democratic committee chairman  henry a. waxman  and because clemens is a republican and is friendly with the president. animal issues in sports q. the times had an excellent story recently on the rehababilitation of michael vick's dogs  although not in the sports section. do you have a view on animal issues in sports? do you make an effort to maintain reporters' awareness of such things as problems with rodeos and bullriding  and in horse racing  in which there have been a number of recent tragic stories  but a lack of looking on regular basis at horse treatment. the westminster dog show has many issues about the actual breeding of dogs to conform to unnatural standards  and to overpopulation of dogs.    tippi w.  manhattan a. hi tippi: thanks for the kind words about juliet macur's story about michael vick's dogs. although the story ran in the a section of the paper  it was produced by the sports department. (bill keller  our executive editor  instituted a new policy for the sake of readers that  as much as possible  if a story runs on the front page of the paper  the continuation of that article should remain in the same section. it's easier on commuters and probably has reduced the number of breakfast-table arguments about who has which section of the paper.) as far as the rest of your question  we're all responsible for staying aware of issues of all sorts. ideas flow from everywhere. juliet macur came up with the idea of doing the story on vick's dogs. one of our editors  jay schreiber  came up with the smart idea of doing a story about the culture of cockfighting in the dominican republic after it came out that pedro martinez of the mets had been a guest at a fight  and katie thomas delivered an insightful look at the issue. bill rhoden and joe drape wrote extensively about the problems in horse racing after barbaro was injured in 2006 and we'll continue to look at that issue and others like it. looking back at sports coverage q. id love to see the times make room   either online or off  to reprint some of its sports stories from the 20th century to coincide with major traditional events like the olympics  u.s. open  world series and other championships.  it would educate those not versed in sports history and shine light on how things have changed or remained the same in sports. have you ever thought about that? my great uncle was allison danzig and im still inspired by his writing  so i have an admitted bias!    rich klein  new york a. this is precisely the ultimate goal of our times topics pages. they represent an astonishing wealth of information and continue to expand by the day. you also can find articles by allison danzig and others by searching our archives on the web site. that's also an incredible resource. online news  recruiting reporters and nascar q. it seems to me that a number of the questions you've already fielded indicate that your readership is having a tough time adapting to the evolving roles of the dead-tree edition and online edition. i love both  and for nearly two decades  i was a daily and sunday reader and subscriber. before the internet  it always frustrated me to see how early your national edition closed  with dozens of instances where a playoff or world series game or super bowl ended too late for coverage. mind you  i didn't need the times to tell me the score  as i had espn to thank for that and more  but what i needed was the incomparable voices of your reporters and columnists. i sorely missed dave anderson's unique perspective. i dropped him a note or three to that effect and on more than one occasion he very generously sent me photocopies of his column. i don't need the times to tell me what roger clemens and brian mcnamee said on tuesday. i need the times to put it into context; to parse the partisan lines  and point out the conflict when members seek the autograph of a witness. speech over  now the question: do you resent how television has used the times as the equivalent of its triple-a  and how they've raided your staff? selena roberts is the most recent example. or do you consider it some sort of poetic justice  because you've raided smaller newspapers and competitors to fill your staff? finally  a brief plea for more reporting  not agate results  about nascar. your viv bernstein is great.   kenn fong a. dear mr. fong: great speech! looks like someone leaked my script to you. what are the odds on publishing point spreads? q. is it your idea or is it the times's policy not to print point spreads and odds on sporting events? in addition to being a disservice to your readers  the failure to publish this public information makes a mockery of the notion that the times is "the paper of record." future researchers and historians relying on the times for insight into the sports world of our day will be presented with a grossly misleading view of that world  namely  they will see no indication of the profound extent of sports gambling in our society.    mike lindquist  new york a. dear mr. lindquist: the practice of not publishing gambling odds has been the paper's policy for years and years. it's something that is discussed periodically. it was adopted because gambling on sports is illegal everywhere but in las vegas and that by publishing odds we would be promoting a largely illegal activity. in the age of the internet  that point seems a lot more quaint than it once did  which is why the subject is periodically revisited. where is ray handley? q. whatever happened to the former giants coach ray handley.  i know that he was not the most popular guy among giants fans  but he seems to have completely disappeared.  is he still involved in sports?   steve g. a. he has simply chosen to live a private life  apparently. love that nascar q. as a nascar fan  i see there is less bylined nascar coverage than in the past. why is that? are there any plans to change that in 2008?    jason levy a. i don't believe there has been a major shift in our nascar coverage. our philosophy in general is that we focus our reporting resources on the most important stories of the moment and  just by the nature of that  it means our coverage of everything ebbs and flows over time. the isiah thomas question q. why does isiah thomas still have a job?  a. because james dolan says he can. drug testing in high schools and colleges? q. are high school and college athletes subject to any drug testing? it's never mentioned in any articles i've read about my beloved tar heels (marion jones' banner in the women's basketball court and her records are still intact at u.n.c.).    ivis bohlen a. high school and college athletes are rarely subject to drug testing unless they compete on an international level in a sport that is under the jurisdiction of the world anti-doping association. some states conduct random tests of high school athletes and the n.c.a.a. also does some random testing  but nothing on the scale of wada or the major professional sports. money and the mitchell report q.  can you please tell me where the funds came from to pay for the mitchell report  re the investigation of drug use in baseball? what was the total cost? and  are there any continuing costs being incurred?   lee myers  lakeland  fla. a. major league baseball paid for the mitchell report. it reportedly cost $20 million. i am not aware of any continuing costs related to the mitchell investigators. the congressional investigation and any federal investigation would be financed by the government. rutgers and the clock q. it is a fact that the clock stopped with 0.2 seconds left on it.  why doesn't ray glier say this?  he merely quotes vivian stringer  which makes it sound like it is just a partisan allegation.  the video clearly shows the clock stopped  before the foul. not a good day at the office for glier.    jon robinson  new brunswick  n.j. a. dear mr. robinson: i just re-read our story on the game and don't see how quoting vivian stringer in this way makes it seem any less true that the clock stopped. also  we followed up the next day with a story that explained why the clock was incorrectly stopped. determining content of paper and web q. your comments in the segment youve called the daily miracle were very interesting.  however  it sounds as though the web version of the new york times has more stories than the newspaper because of space limitations.  is that the case? if so  how do you and your staff decide what and how much goes into the web version and what goes into the print version?  if the stories are much the same  but the web version has more coverage  how do you decide what and how much is to appear there?    judith feinleib  belmont  mass. a. dear ms. feinleib: the web site contains vastly more than the paper. there are no limits to how much can go on the web. there are strict limits to how much can go into the paper. (in large part  the size of the newspaper is determined by the amount of advertising contained in that paper.) those limits have existed throughout the history of newspapers and  as a result  we've always had to make judgments on what to put into the paper and what to leave out. at the times  we must make additional judgments because we have both a metropolitan edition of the paper  which is geared toward local readers  and a national edition. those editions are never identical. we choose story lineups for each that we think will be of most interest to the readers of those particular editions. for example  if you buy the new york times in phoenix on a monday of n.f.l. season  the main story in our section may be about the most important game in the league that day. if you buy the paper in the new york area  the main story will be about the giants or jets. the web contains all of that and more. we have several newspaper publishing deadlines each day and often print a story in the first edition that drops out after a game result becomes available. if you buy the paper  you'll get one story or the other. if you look on the web  you'll find both. but we've added more value to our web site with blogs devoted to particular sports  audio  video and photographic slide shows and many other special elements. coordinating it all is one of our biggest challenges  but we believe readers will find real value in both the print paper and the web. new-fangled internet ways q. do you expect the new york times to adopt some of the methods used by internet-only sports commentators?  will it hire statistically savvy new thinkers  or maybe some gonzo younger writers/ columnists? the internet-only sources generally rely on statistics for analysis or on brash tabloid style.  they analyze players  teams and games based on performance and projected performance or they just write in an interesting  titillating and innovative style.  it matters little what player a feels  or what his manager says  etc. what do the numbers say? the strength of print media (including their internet arms) is access   presence at the game  press events  in the locker room and in executive suites generate quotes and insider information.  but a lot of that seems clichd at this point  the message modulated and stripped of variety.  worse  the access is often predicated on soft treatment.   a.we're always open to new ideas  but the new york times became what it is by holding to high standards of journalism. it's my view that the times will continue to distinguish itself by playing to our strengths: smart  hard-nosed reporting  especially on issues  as we've shown in our coverage of the mitchell report and on concussions  to name just two examples. and then there's college hockey q. as a college hockey fan (alumnus of boston university)  i am disappointed that the times no longer has a weekly college hockey column and does not even print the standings of the various n.c.a.a. hockey leagues.  sure  i can  and do  obtain information about college hockey from various web sites. still  it was always much more gratifying reading about college hockey in the times. i like the gravitas that the times provides. what went into the thought process that resulted in the times discontinuing the weekly coverage?    lenny busch a. dear mr. busch: if you've been reading this  you've seen by now that a lot of people would like us to cover a lot of things. again  it's a question of resources. while i fully understand that our coverage of these sports validates the interests of people who follow them  our mission has changed significantly from the days when we were labeled the "paper of record." as you note  the information you're interested in is on the web every day. given that  what are we adding to your knowledge by running that same information once a week? the great thing for folks like yourself is that you can get the in-depth information you crave from a specialized site. win one for the stadium? q. what do you think about a grass-roots movement to persuade the giants to play one last game in yankee stadium before the demolition? i know that giants stadium holds 80 000  as opposed to 56 000 or so at yankee stadium. but they could charge a few bucks more  and fill up the "batter's eye" area. it would be the hottest ticket in town...the last event ever at yankee stadium. wow. (and  what about one last game at shea for the jets?)     john j. grady  toledo  ohio a. i think the giants would have some pretty angry season ticket holders! i know i wouldn't be too happy if i was told that i was losing out on a ticket for the sake of nostalgia. getting the late scores q. i live approximately 18 miles from your office. still  the edition of the times that arrives at my door each morning never  never  includes the results of games or events that end as late as 11 p.m. the latest example is tuesday's westminster best in show. why?   howard wolff  west orange  n.j. a. the biggest challenge in the newspaper business is the delivery system. in order to get our papers printed and then driven to stores and doorsteps around the region  it's necessary to send the paper to the presses starting at 10:30 each night. we print a second edition at 11:30 and a third at 12:30  so the news in your paper depends on when it was printed. you're obviously getting either the first or second edition. it only takes a few minutes to get those stories up on our web site  so check there if it's not in your paper. the effects of hgh on adults q. dear mr. jolly:  with all the hubbub about clemens et al. regarding human growth hormone  it is time to ask two questions: 1.  is there any clinical evidence that hgh has a salutary effect in normal human adults? 2. if the answer is no  and i suspect it is  why has this not been a subject for the media?    steve marburg a. duff wilson  who has covered the clemens investigation for us  wrote an extensive piece about hgh and its popularity among the anti-aging crowd. the history of sports q. what are the some of the sports history topics that the times might find to be groundbreaking and novel? your dominican cockfighting piece was a recent example. the "sport" of cockfighting goes back to "ancient" times. regarding the cockfighting story  it was an excellent primary source document for students in a history and philosophy of sport class  which i currently teach. [curiously  as any history proceeds  some of my students secretly wondered why senator mitchell had tagged my name in his report  but it must be major league baseball player doluca who was turned into a deloca typo via online chat.] with outstanding sport history scholars on all continents  what significant topics would the times consider in its sports opinion columns? i'm sure you have your fair number of submissions from a few scholars who think they have some unique historical insight into sport  but our style may not fit the popular appeal of the new york times marketing division.  many thanks for providing good insight into the new york times operation via "talk to the newsroom." the platform of education and journalism  provides a needed public service where many scholars enjoy participation as "public intellectuals."    paul j. deloca  greensboro  n.c. a. i appreciate the compliments. a story like the one katie thomas wrote about cockfighting in the dominican republic becomes relevant when there's a news hook. in this case  a video came out showing pedro martinez of the mets at a cockfight with the former baseball star juan marichal. that prompted protests from animal rights groups and was also newsworthy because it came just after the michael vick case for dog abuse. as i noted earlier  our editor jay schreiber smartly pointed out the cultural differences  while cockfighting is abhorrent in the united states  it's part of life in the dominican republic  and we felt the time was right to explore that. obligation for leadership? q. first  thanks for the thoughtful answers in this week's "talk to the newsroom."  i'll be sharing your answer about the inner workings of the sports department with my journalism classes in the future. second  i wanted to follow up the question and answer regarding the duke lacrosse team scandal. yes  it was a rogue prosecutor and the young men were indeed innocent of the charge. but the scandal resulted in a good deal of reporting on the team's overall conduct  both in your paper and elsewhere (i particularly remember an h.g. bissinger piece in vanity fair). these pieces left little doubt that the duke lacrosse team was an organization out of control. whether their eventual treatment at the hands of the legal system was fair or not  the players' actions put them in a position to be accused and arrested. my question from all of this is  does the media  and i count the new york times as a leader in american media  have an obligation to help restore some sanity to american sports by reporting on the lack of balance in university sports programs? and is this something  however it's phrased  that is a priority in your department?    tom clark a. dear mr. clark: that's a tricky question to ask because it's not our role to judge our culture's sanity. that's up to society as a whole. our part in that is reporting on what's happening in our culture as objectively as possible and to complement that reporting with commentary to help give our readers an informed opinion of those developments. but your e-mail does speak to a distinction we received last year from the institute for international sport. conflict of interest? q. please address the conflict of interest in writing about a company that your parent company owns a stake in  i.e.  the boston red sox. this seems particularly relevant when a number of your writers have seemed to be particularly hostile toward its chief competitor the new york yankees. shouldn't these articles begin with a disclosure of the conflict? is there a way to explain to the readers exactly how much the red sox contribute to the new york times bottom line? do writers hold stock in the new york times? does the performance of the red sox have any effect on the viability of their pension plan  etc? i'm also interested in the very obvious difference in tone between boston globe and new york times sports coverage. are there companywide standards for "impartiality" in sports coverage or are they newspaper or editor dependent? is it a matter of the differences between writing for a local vs. national audience? or is it a matter of differences in the type of recruiting and talent development between the two papers. do you care that your paper isn't the "hometown sports section" in the same way that the new york post and the daily news are? finally  i was very disappointed by the cavalier and self-serving way selena roberts excused her inflamatory rush to judgment against the duke lacrosse team. in previous cases the new york times has agonized over the way it treated sexual assault victims  viz william kennedy smith case  in this case the wronged party was the accused  yet there seemed to be no institutional response from the sports editors to apologize for the inaccurate and reputation destroying portrayals. i fully understand the racial sensitivities involved  but i think justice and fairness require an apology.     adam sugihara a. the duke question has been addressed above and the red sox question is also familiar  but since i haven't addressed it in this session  i'll recast my answer from our 2006 "talk to the newsroom" session: is play magazine needed? q. i've wondered: why did the new york times launch play magazine? the market for sports magazines seems saturated with all kinds of offerings  not to mention the proliferation of online news sources. moreover  the times's sports section seems perfectly capable of delivering the stories published in play. so  what's the game? did the times just want to give a nyt magazine-type prestige to certain sports stories?    michael rowe  minneapolis a. first  let me explain that play magazine is part of our magazine group  with the sunday magazine  t and others and those magazines have separate editors. play would not have been launched if the company didn't think it could be a winning business proposition. there's nothing wrong with raising the prestige of sports as far as i'm concerned. why is belichick an issue? q. what exactly are the issues involving federal law that have senator arlen specter so worried about protecting the country from bill belichick and videotaping coaches on the sidelines?  a. you can judge for yourself. there are at least two considerations. first  here is how senator specter answered that question: second  here is what his critics question  as noted in an article by judy battista: according to the nonpartisan center for responsive politics and its web site  opensecrets.org  mr. specter has received $100 000 in campaign contributions since 2003 from the political action committee  owners or employees of comcast corp.  the philadelphia-based cable operator that is engaged  along with other cable companies  in a contentious battle with the n.f.l. over distribution of the nfl network. advantage clarey q. i just want to say that christopher clarey is by far the best tennis writer you have ever had there! his writing is so crisp and to the point  no surplusage or sarcasm or sardonic cracks  right to the point. he's the best tennis writer you've had.  thank you!  a. chris clarey is terrific  we agree. but we've been fortunate to have a long line of terrific tennis writers. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

sports, was the super bowl ad featuring clint eastwood  its halftime in america  a chrysler ad or an obama re-election ad? confusion abounded. after all  the spot seemed to tout the success of the auto bailouts  which the four remaining republican presidential candidates were against. halftime is also an easy metaphor for a president whos nearing the end of one term but seeking a second. as soon as the ad ran  my twitter timeline lit up with people who thought it was a re-election ad. to which i tweeted: @charlesmblow charles m. blow some of you make a good point: did david axelrod find a way to sneak an obama re-election ad into the superbowl? #clint mon feb 6 1:25:14  via charles m. blow that was a joke of course. but the ad was no laughing matter to karl rove  the bush-era minister of machiavellianism. on monday  rove told fox news  i was  frankly  offended by it. there was more: this is a sign of what happens when you have the government getting in bed with big business like the bailout of the auto companies. they begin to  the leadership of the auto companies feel they need to do something to repay their political patrons. remember  we lost $1.8 billion as taxpayers on the government bailout of chrysler  and were going to lose $14 billion in the bailout of chrysler and general motors. and you got to bet in the boardrooms and management suites of these two big car companies  they are saying to themselves  look  the president bailed us out rather than making us go through the normal bankruptcy  he bailed us out. were going to end up not having to pay back this money to the taxpayers. rove went on to say: this is a sign of what happens when you have chicago-style politics  and the president of the united states and his political minions are  in essence  using our tax dollars to buy corporate advertising and the best wishes of the management  which is benefited by getting a bunch of our money that theyll never pay back. first  lets be clear about clint  if thats possible. he was actually opposed to the bailouts. he told the los angeles times in november: we shouldnt be bailing out the banks and car companies. if a c.e.o. cant figure out how to make his company profitable  then he shouldnt be the c.e.o. as for his political ideology  things are a bit ambiguous. as the washington post noted on monday: he was the nonpartisan mayor of carmel  calif.  for two years. george h.w. bush considered asking eastwood to be his running mate in 1988. while he has supported some democrats in california  eastwood said in 2011 that he couldnt recall ever voting for a democratic presidential candidate. in 2008  he supported sen. john mccain (r-ariz.). there is a lot of confusion swirling around under that furrowed brow. now that we have that out of the way  lets get to roves deceptive lateral pass of all the chrysler bailout blame to the obama administration. the detroit news was quick to point out yesterday that it was george w. bush who stroked the first check to chrysler. rove didnt mention that it was bush who first agreed to save chrysler. how convenient. chrysler nearly collapsed in late 2008 under private equity ownership. bush agreed to a $4 billion bailout of the company. as factcheck.org has pointed out: chrysler received $4 billion on jan. 2  2009  (18 days before obama took office) and $8.5 billion on april 30 (when obama was president)  according to this government accountability office report (page 9) on tarp. factcheck.org went on to outline what happened next  citing a government accountability office report issued on may 10: when chrysler filed for bankruptcy on april 30  2009  the new chrysler that emerged assumed only some of the $4 billion loaned by the bush administration. in a new report issued last month  the g.a.o. explained that treasury  under the obama administration  wrote off $1.6 billion of the original $4 billion loan extended to the old chrysler. as of may  chrysler had returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments  interest and cancelled commitments. however  treasury conceded that it is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in chrysler. in july the government sold its stock in the company  further reducing the loss.as the times reported: the federal government on thursday shed the last of its stake in chrysler  giving majority control of the carmaker to fiat  the italian company  while leaving taxpayers $1.3 billion short of recovering the full investment they made two years ago to keep chrysler from going out of business. the article continued: the treasury department said in a statement that it had recovered $11.2 billion of the $12.5 billion it lent to chrysler and that it would write off the bulk of the balance. the unpaid portion is on the balance sheet of the old chrysler  a collection of unwanted assets being liquidated in bankruptcy. now  lets weigh whatever losses there may be against the benefits. as david kiley  editor-in-chief of aol autos  put it in may: in all  the center for automotive research (car) in ann arbor  mich.  reckons the governments bailouts of the u.s. auto industry spared more than 1.14 million jobs in 2009  and prevented additional personal income losses of nearly $97 billion in 2009 and 2010. another 314 400 jobs were saved in 2010. the research organization based its conclusions on the potential impact of auto-industry collapse for jobs at u.s. automakers and suppliers  and ripple effects on the economy at large. when viewed this way  a $1.3 billion loss  or as rove puts it a $1.8 billion loss  is negligible and well worth it. trying to eschew bushs role in order to tarnish obamas results is

sports,advertisement by richard b. woodwarddec. 26  2004  news articles about the christmas run-up have in recent years taken a turn for the perverse. while it was once common to feel pity for those who couldn't afford to buy gifts for their children  now we are called upon to fret about the health of our local retailers  many of whom  as reporters constantly remind us  earn as much as one-quarter of their annual income during the year's home stretch. will they meet last year's numbers? that's the anxious question hanging over the holiday season. with economists saluting the consumer as the hero who enables our high standard of living  we increasingly feel it's our duty to buy things we don't need with cash we don't have. and these days  consumerism and national identity have been linked ever more closely. president bush implied as much in a speech to congress on sept. 20  2001  in which he urged our "continued participation and confidence in the american economy" in order to help recover from the terrorist attacks. as the journalist allan sloan remarked in this newspaper  the president's exhortation "conflated patriotism with shopping. maxing out your credit cards at the mall wasn't self-indulgence  it was a way to get back at osama bin laden." consumerism in defense of liberty is no crime in america. indeed  one of the subtexts in the business of holidays (monacelli press  $35)  the glossy collection of amusing  cynical essays edited by maud lavin  is that our grossly commercial approach to celebrations  sacred or profane  may be crass  but is ultimately salutary. entwining ethnic and religious differences with the ritual of spending or making money  our motley calendar of holidays -+groundhog day  presidents' day  april fool's day  mother's day  gay pride day  labor day  ramadan  thanksgiving  hanukkah  christmas  kwanzaa -- is a testament to the bottomless ingenuity of capitalism. for example  in one essay in the collection  amy tavormina fidler writes that the $39.8 billion diet industry now concentrates its advertising on new year's day when many women and not a few men traditionally resolve to lose weight. this strategy is diabolically effective because so many of the post-halloween holidays-including  as she notes  new year's day itself -- encourage us to stuff our faces. within the endless cycle of gorging and purging there's room for everyone to earn a buck. advertisement tourists spend an estimated $1 billion in new orleans during the nearly two-month debauch of mardi gras. but perhaps no one has exploited the event more resourcefully than joe francis. after studying film and business at the university of southern california  he built a soft-porn empire with his "girls gone wild" videos. advertised on television more than 40 000 times a year  the series sold 4.5 million copies in 2002 alone. the beauty of his scheme is that he doesn't have to pay his talent; he need only train his cameras on drunken young women glad to flash their naked breasts at mardi gras revelers  an american tradition whose origins remain mysterious. of course  not everyone has applauded francis' approach. he's awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and enticing underage girls to do grown-up things. advertisement national holidays are supposed to dissolve inhibitions and fold isolated individuals into a group. even holidays that were once declarations of minority pride or separatism have become parties with an open-door policy. everyone is invited to overindulge on chinese new year and st. patrick's day. more avocados are sold on cinco de mayo than at any time of the year  directly followed by superbowl sunday  and only a small fraction are bought by latinos. candy and greeting card manufacturers have insinuated themselves into various holiday rites  from valentine's day to easter. jason warriner's essay relates the story of peeps  those tasteless dyed-marshmallow chicks produced since 1953 by the just born company in pennsylvania and now an easter staple. the cute  ubiquitous confections have also spawned internet sites offering tips on ways to "torture" a peep. mr. warriner's favorite seems to be "peeps jousting": stick toothpicks in a pair of peeps; place in microwave and set timer for several minutes; whichever peep engulfs the opponent in hot goo is the winner. (the loser presumably has to scrub out the oven.) eliza rosen describes the futile efforts by jewish leaders over the years to dress up hanukkah  a holiday of minor religious import  with rituals so that it might compete with the razzle-dazzle of the american christmas. by the 50's  companies were pushing everything from special blue-and-silver wrapping paper to hanukkah bushes to hanukkah bush ornaments. but efforts to preserve a distinct judaic orbit beyond the gravitational pull of christmas can be gauged by a 1989 item from a newsletter in suffern  n.y. it alerts the community to follow santa claus in the parade to "the village hall where the menorah lighting will take place."  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. martin luther king jr.'s birthday is still largely free of ancillary merchandise. only nonprofit and education foundations may benefit from his legacy. the king family tightly controls his image and words with regular lawsuits against unlicensed profiteers  and groups like the n.a.a.c.p. have spoken out against any hint of commercialization. yet the absence of a full-blown consumer aura to the holiday may paradoxically prevent king from assuming his rightful place in the nation's life  alongside washington and lincoln. after all  you aren't an american icon until your silhouette can be slapped on a newspaper ad to sell a toyota. of course  there has hardly been a time or place when vulgar worldliness didn't mingle with -- or trump -- holy matters. chaucer appreciated the joys of consumerism. the pilgrims in his tales are on their way to the shrine of the martyred st. thomas  becket at canterbury  but it quickly becomes clear that a good number are making the journey primarily to eat and drink  slip marital bonds  and swap stories with strangers. organized religion has always needed revelers. victor hugo's "notre dame de paris" opens on january 6  1482  during three kings day and the feast of fools. hugo imagines the scene as a wild religious carnival  with bonfires and a maypole  that is less about prayer than whoop-de-do. innkeepers are often just as necessary. in iraq earlier this year the merchants in najaf couldn't wait for muqtada al-sadr and his armed men to vacate the city. their belligerent presence was ruining the local economy  which relies heavily on income from streams of penitents to the shia shrines. americans may have come late to the time-honored tradition of making money on any occasion of the year  but they've certainly embraced it with gusto. in "the business of holidays " alyson priestap-beaton writes about festivus  the holiday invented by george costanza's father on an episode of "seinfeld." celebrated on dec. 23  in response to the materialism of christmas  it allows friends to air grievances and "demonstrate feats of strength" by hanging in the air while holding on to a bare silver pole  the holiday's only decoration. there is nothing to buy. this didn't stop ben & jerry's from capitalizing on the show's immense popularity in 1999 by briefly introducing an ice-cream flavor called festivus. festivus is still observed by fans around the country  not to mention memorialized in this book and on the "seinfeld" dvd's. that a fictional  anticommercial holiday on a television show "about nothing" would inspire a real holiday and a real product is more than a little bizarre. america's relentless consumption and frivolity may be one reason why the world envies and hates us. but for better or worse  that's who we are. happy festivus! were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,the recent monster slam-dunk by blake griffin of the los angeles clippers has ignited exactly the kind of debate the internet does so well. (no  i dont mean which parks and recreation quote goes best with this screengrab from downton abbey?) the debate: is griffins dunk the best of all time? in fact  the griffin dunk debate quickly traversed a familiar hyberbolic trajectory: from is this the dunk of the year? to is this blake griffins best dunk ever? to is this the best dunk of all time? to this is not even in the top 20 dunks of all time. which is why its handy  in such situations  to apply what i like to call the shakespeare/beatles/einstein rule  or  for short  the shakesbeatlestein principle. the shakesbeatlestein principle applies when there is an obvious  unimpeachable and inarguable answer to the question  what is the best [blank] ever? for example: who is the greatest writer of all time? shakespeare. what is the greatest pop band of all time? the beatles. who is the greatest genius of all time? einstein. this is not to say that these answers are objectively correct. only that they are the rare result of an unspoken communal coalescence around a single answer. other categories  by contrast  offer no shakesbeatlestein. for example  greatest american novel. your mind might jump immediately to moby dick or the great gatsby or invisible man  but thats the point. you could make a case for any number of candidates. the question is an argument-starter  not an argument-ender. ergo  no shakesbeatlestein. there are three qualifications to be considered a shakesbeatlestein: 1. the answer is an acknowledged consensus choice. you know that saying in sports  the road to the superbowl goes through green bay (or new england  or new york  or which ever citys team last won)? well  the road to greatest pop band ever goes through the beatles. sure  you could zag while the world zigs and say the clash or the rolling stones or  i dont know  the las  then offer some esoteric argument to back it up. that is precisely what makes these debates fun. but the fact is that what youre actually doing is giving an answer of not the beatles. and youll have to defend your decision not to choose them. the same holds true for who is the greatest writer of all time? its shakespeare  obviously. you want to make a case for keats? joyce? toni morrison? dame barbara cartland? using some complex  turn-conventional-wisdom-on-its-head approach? go ahead. but then its not a debate so much as its a case study in self-conscious contrarianism. 2. the answer has become a de facto synonym for the attribute in question. when you want to taunt a precocious child about his or her intellect  you dont say: who do you think you are? some kind of nikola tesla? no. you say: what do you think you are? einstein? similarly  when youre madly scribbling away on some literary masterpiece  your adoring mother isnt going to point at you and say  such a little wordsworth! you are such a little shakespeare  or you are nothing at all. 3. the answer is the first suggestion when you google the question. go ahead. type greatest writer of all time into google. but back to blake griffin. in the greatest-dunk-of-all-time argument  id argue that there is  in fact  a shakesbeatlestein: the vince carter dunk over frederic weis at the 2000 olympics. dont take my word for it; the experts agree. or you could just judge for yourself:  the question  then  is what other cultural figures/products/events can rightly be called shakesbeatlesteins? offhand  i can nominate a few:  shakesbeatlestein actor: sir laurence olivier. (proud parents at school pageants everywhere are heard to exclaim: look at my little olivier!) however  you could make a case  i believe  for meryl streep  who has become the american/cinematic exemplar of acting prowess. (who do you think you are? meryl streep?) shakesbeatlestein sex-symbol: marilyn monroe. what  youre going to pick someone other than marilyn monroe? then youre going to have to spend some time explaining why you didnt pick marilyn monroe. shakesbeatlestein best pop song of the 1990s: smells like teen spirit. the greatest song of the 1980s  for example  or the greatest song of the 2000s  are both rightly matters of contention. but you cant not choose teen spirit as the greatest song of the 1990s  or  if you do  youre basically doing it for the sole reason of reaffirming that you are that much cooler than everyone else. shakesbeatlestein basketball player: michael jordan. greatest ever. this is accepted wisdom. perhaps as time passes and memories of his accomplishments fade and michael jordan continues to dress like this  that will change. but for now: greatest basketball player = jordan. period. you could  in fact  argue for the necessity of a second complimentary term  which refers to something that is quite obviously therunner-up to thebest thing of all time  a kind of shakesbeatlestein sidekick. youd call this the pippen. the rolling stones are the pippen. shakesbeatlestein living american novelist: philip roth briefly seemed destined for shakesbeatlestein status  but now even time magazine  which anointed him as such  no longer agrees with time magazine on this front. shakesbeatlestein tv show: for a while  the sopranos was a strong candidate  back when people were not only calling it the best show of all time but the best anything ever of ever. however  you could now find people making entirely plausible cases for the wire  breaking bad  or even a darkhorse  currently shelved comedy. what are some other shakebeatlestains? not things you think are the best  necessarily  but things you think everyone has universally embraced as the best. this could mean music  books  food  sports  fashion  etc. is there a shakesbeatlestein classical composer? a shakesbeatlestein stand-up comedian? a shakesbeatlestein poet? a shakesbeatlestein chef? in a related story  the only way to unseat a shakebeatlestein is to trick that person into saying shakebeatlestein three times. shakesbeatlestein! shakesbeatlestein! shakesbeatlestein! i hope someone tries this at the oscars with meryl streep. latest issue | october 19  2014the men of wellesley college  the oligarching of american politics  cristela alonzo's family-focused sitcom and more. the 6th floor is the blog of the new york times magazine  where staff members  editors  designers  writers  photo editors and researchers  share ideas  arguments  curiosities and links.     here  a few of the most romantic kisses in film  from young love to foiled love.readmore     sometimes a kiss in cinema signals stormy weather; sometimes it signals clear skies.readmore     not every kiss is an act of love. in some cases  its an act of aggression.readmore     bruce grierson wrote this weeks cover story about ellen langer  a harvard psychologist who has conducted experiments that involve manipulating environments to turn back subjects perceptions of their own age.readmore     in the comments to mark leibovichs article about mitt romney  readers debated whether the former nominee should consider another run for the presidency.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,advertisement by john f. burnsjune 23  2008  douglas  isle of man  halfway down the suburban road that descends bray hill  past the traffic lights  between the elementary school and rows of homes with families relaxing in their front yards  there is a barely perceptible bump. crouching on their 1 000-cubic-centimeter honda  suzuki and yamaha motorcycles  the race leaders hit the bump at 185 miles an hour  their machines rearing up like prancing horses before settling back onto the asphalt and continuing down the hill at full throttle  engines shrieking. near the bottom they pass a 30-miles-per-hour speed-limit sign at 195 m.p.h.  then sweep through a right curve and out of sight. to see the tourist trophy  or t.t.  races on this idyllically lovely but quirky island in the irish sea is to watch men operating at the edge of physics  and of reason. daytona  indianapolis  le mans  monaco  monza  all are better-known cathedrals of speed and risk. but nowhere are the extremes as great as on the isle of man  which has largely resisted a push for stricter safety measures that has all but eliminated true road racing elsewhere. since the first tourist trophy race in 1907   the island has maintained the tradition   the motorcycles tearing then as now  through villages and towns on everyday public roads  achieving unimaginable speeds. advertisement this is the super bowl; this is the big show  said mark miller  a graduate in aeronautical science from long beach  calif.  who was one of two americans among the 600 riders competing in this years t.t. races  held each year in early june. advertisement but with the tradition has come a grim record of deaths  224 riders killed over the years in the tourist trophy races and another motorcycle event  the manx grand prix  that runs on the same course in late summer. dozens more deaths have occurred among race marshals  spectators and civilian riders who take to the course after the races on high-powered road bikes and try to emulate the racers daredevil feats. despite a toll that mounts nearly every year  and a coroners report that identified major failings in track supervision after an accident last year that killed an english rider and two spectators  the isle of man clings proudly to the races. control of the races rests with the island government  which values them as a way to increase tourism; this year  the 35 000 visitors  from all over europe  spent an estimated $25 million. but the days when the races were an economic mainstay are gone  as a boom in banking  financial services and manufacturing has pushed the gross national product of the island  which until only 20 years ago was an outpost of poverty with a declining population  past $3 billion. the races enduring value these days  apart from the astonishing spectacle  seems to lie in their sustaining influence on the islands psyche. in the races  many of the 80 000 inhabitants say  they find affirmation of the islands do-it-my-way tradition  free from many of the timid constraints that they say have made a nanny state of modern britain. lying at roughly equal distances from england  ireland and scotland  the island has a population that is a mix of viking  scottish  irish and english blood  and a 1 000-year-old parliament  the tynwald  that islanders contend is the worlds longest-surviving democratic institution. many of the top riders over the decades have come from scots-irish stock  with a tradition  bred by history  of defying imposed authority. over the decades  the isle of man has evolved with the t.t. races  and the races have evolved with the isle of man  said tony brown  58   a local businessman and the islands chief minister  as he greeted visitors in a hospitality tent near the pits. its part of our culture. though it is only 65 miles by ferry from the british mainland and recognizes queen elizabeth ii as its head of state  the island is not part of the united kingdom. it is what is known in british constitutional parlance as a self-governing dependent territory  with freedom to fashion its own laws and way of life. advertisement like a range of other island territories around the world  it is a tax haven  attracting lucrative foreign banking and investment that have pushed living standards past those in mainland britain. in recent years  the government has cracked down on tax evaders  money-launderers and other white-collar criminals  winning plaudits from senior american officials and getting the island off the united states treasurys list of uncooperative tax havens. the government now steers a judicious course  fostering the islands allure to the wealthy while bolstering  through new tax and accounting rules  its claim to be a reputable international citizen. but caution is scarcely the hallmark of what happens here during race week and the week of practice that precedes it. mr. miller  who has had a long and successful career on the dedicated tracks used for motorcycle racing in the united states  was stunned when he arrived for his first race here two years ago and set out to learn the course. starting in douglas  the capital  the circuit has 226 corners on its way north to the town of ramsey  then back to douglas over the 2 036-foot-high snaefell mountain  which overlooks the islands northern reaches. every stretch is bordered by what the riders call street furniture  stone walls  curbs  pubs  houses  shops  telephone booths  mailboxes  lampposts  manhole covers  bumps and overhanging trees  little of it protected by air bags  hay bales or other safety features.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. along the way are thousands of spectators standing on grassy banks and behind stone walls  almost close enough at some points to reach out and touch the riders helmets as they rocket past. its the scariest thing ive ever done  mr. miller said after leaving this years main race  the senior t.t.  with an early mechanical failure on his honda. going through those villages at 180 miles an hour  youve got the bike bucking like a bronco and just about tearing the handlebars out of your hands  and youre fighting constantly to keep in full tuck  down behind the fairing  the motorcycles aerodynamic shell. its like taking a fighter jet down to tree level  popping the canopy  turning upside down  then going down to road level and touching your helmet on the pavement  he said. one mistake and its your life. thirty-two riders have died in the past 10 years  including a sidecar rider in 1999 who was one of three women to die while competing in the races. nine riders died in 2005  the worst year in tourist trophy history. the government instituted an array of safety measures after the accident last year in which a rider fatally struck two people watching from an area on snaefell that was prohibited to spectators though it was not marked as such. but mr. brown  the chief minister  took a laissez-faire attitude about the dangers to racers. everybody who competes in the t.t. knows the risks  he said. nobodys forced to ride. this year there were no deaths among competing riders or spectators  but four among visitors speeding over snaefell on their motorcycles after the races. advertisement the races appeal reaches far beyond the culture of dyed-in-the-wool bikers. one enthusiast with memories of the races in the 1930s is sir frank kermode  a native manxman  as islanders are known  who is widely regarded as one of the worlds leading literary scholars. now 88 and living in cambridge  england  where he taught for years  he took time off from writing an article for the new york review of books to reminisce about his boyhood days in the 1930s  rising at 4:30 a.m. to get a good vantage point along the route  and to get autographs from the champion riders. i was crazy about the races  sir frank said. but the dangers were ever-present. the riders  he said  used to get killed like flies. today  many racers say that dwelling on the risk of death would make it impossible to compete effectively. but others  including john mcguinness  an english rider who last year set the lap speed record  an average of 130.4 m.p.h. over the 37  3/4-mile circuit  take another view. this year  mr. mcguinness won the senior t.t.  a six-lap event  for the fourth time in succession. afterward  still in his racing leathers  he talked about the racing friends he had lost in fatal accidents on the island  including david jefferies  a multiple winner  who was killed while practicing in 2003. mr. mcguinness  who has won 14 tourist trophy  races  the second-highest total  said he thought about the hazards every moment during a race. when youre at 200 m.p.h. on a bike here  theres no feeling like it anywhere in the world  he said. but he said he thought of his lost friends every time he passed the places on the track where they were killed. every time i go through  he said  i ask them to look after me. a version of this article appears in

sports, monday is budget day  when president obama releases his $3.7 trillion budget valentine. but first  the caucus has assembled a look at some of the best quotes of the weekend. 1. saturday night live took aim at fox news host bill oreillys interview with president obama before the superbowl. the skit depicts mr. oreilly as a know-nothing bully who at one point yells at mr. obama to stay in his seat. and it makes fun of the hosts tendency to insist hes right  even when hes not. after insisting that the president of afghanistan is muammar el-qaddafi  he tells mr. obama: mr. president  i like you. youre a good guy and i truly believe as president  youre doing the best you can for the country. but im pretty sure its qaddafi. (its hamid karzai.) 2. haley barbour  the republican governor of mississippi and a potential presidential candidate in 2012  did not try to shy away from his former occupation as a lobbyist during an interview sunday. im a lobbyist  he said on fox news sunday. the guy who gets elected president will immediately be lobbying. thats what presidents do for a living. mr. barbour still receives what he called retirement income from the lobbying firm he helped found  barbour  griffith and rogers. 3. most of the likely republican candidates for president have remained quiet about the events in egypt. but tim pawlenty  the former republican governor of minnesota  said on abcs this week program on sunday that mr. obama needs to do more to make sure the muslim brotherhood doesnt take control in that country. the president of the united states ducked the question whether he thought it was a good or a bad idea whether the muslim brotherhood should be running egypt  mr. pawlenty said. im telling you: its a bad idea. and we need to do whatever we can to minimize and  the likelihood of that outcome. 4. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  the republican leader in the senate  declared saturday night that the legislative agenda of barack obama is over. he made the remark  according to the associated press  during a speech in louisville  kentucky at the state partys lincoln days dinner. mr. mcconnell is known for quips like that. last year  he famously said that it was his number one priority to make sure that mr. obama remained a one-term president. 5. representative allen west of florida is just a freshman member of congress. but he snagged the final speaking slot of the conservative political action committee on saturday. he offered a passionate defense of conservatism: liberal progressivism evolved after our constitution  he said. it has repeatedly failed all over the world so why do we think it could be successful here in the united states of america? mr. west is african american and questioned what he called hostile attacks from the liberal left that characterize conservatives as racist. perhaps they should see who is standing up here as your keynote speaker. 6. hes relatively new to the job  but this is jacob lews day. as president obamas budget director  mr. lew on monday is responsible for overseeing the rollout of the $3.7 trillion budget proposal. over the weekend  on cnn  mr. lew described it as a very difficult budget and took aim at those  including republicans  who say theres more that could be cut  easily. were beyond the easy  low-hanging fruit  to say that its all waste and fraud  he said. the latest on president obama  congress and other political news from washington -- and around the nation -- from the staff of the new york times.      the caucus on monday suspended its campaign. follow first draft  a fast-paced political briefing on all things washington and elections. readmore     congress approved funding for equipping syrian rebels against islamic states and lawmakers will discuss their votes on several of the sunday shows.readmore     president obama vowed to degrade and ultimately destroy isis in a speech he gave on wednesday. lawmakers and analysts will discuss his strategy on the sunday shows. readmore     lawmakers will weigh in on president obamas international coalition to fight islamist militants.readmore     president obama drew criticism on thursday when he said  we dont have a strategy yet  for military action against isis in syria. lawmakers will weigh in on mr. obamas comments on the sunday shows.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,weve selected some reader responses to john maxymuks countdown series on giants stadium  which hosted its last giants game on sunday.  at the beginning of the season  will leitch of new york magazine wrote   that no one cries for the meadowlands  but lets try to appreciate it for what it is: a bygone civic treasure  in its own way. it might be hard to be in an appreciative mood  after the giants collapse  and after a season of anxiety for many fans who faced tough decisions about the higher prices at the new stadium next year. but they cant take away the memories: no. 1 on giants stadium countdown: playoffs? yes  after 18 years  paul from white plains: it is appropriate that this 1981 game be considered the no. 1 giants stadium memory. after losing to the panthers yesterday and not making the playoffs  all giants fans are deeply disappointed. but just think back to the good life as a giants fan ever since their first super bowl victory in 1987. we have been spoiled with many  many postseason appearances and almost as many memorable playoff victories  including 3 n.f.l. championships. in 1981 we just wanted to make the playoffs. i was at that game and it was freezing cold from beginning to end. when danelo clanked the first kick in overtime  we all thought same old giants. but when he made the second kick  it was literally like a weight had been lifted off the back of every giants fan everywhere. i was in a dream state all the way home and for many days after. the win over the eagles (thank you rob carpenter) was icing on the cake. the loss to the 49ers was sad  but we finally had real hope for the future. just making the playoffs in those days was like winning the super bowl for giants fans. we need to remember that today in our disappointment of yesterday. its still great to be a giants fan. and they will be back.  db19 from scarsdale: an inspired choice for #1. as a long-suffering fan who followed the team to yale  shea and nj  this game was really a turning point. the giants never beat the cowboys back then and to beat dallas and go to the playoffs was almost unimaginable. it was just a few years earlier that people were flying planes with banners and burning tickets. i never saw the stuff after 1987 as being as significant (and i was away for maras death). spot on the top three picks and after that it gets pretty subjective. never saw the vikings thing as such a big deal b/c they lost the super bowl anyway-badly. no. 2 on the countdown: to the super bowl  wind at their backs. eb from brooklyn: i was sitting in sec. 321  three rows from the top of the stadium  in the heart of the vortex  which was running counter clockwise up there that day. my enduring memory is of the great burst of homemade confetti/trash thrown after the manuel touchdown  and spending the rest of the game getting blindsided every few minutes by a slap of junk on the left side of the face. great times!!! warren: upon entering the stadium  my eyes gazed up to the upper decks and the swirling ticker-tape parade giant fans had taken upon themselves to set up. nyc mayor ed koch had derided local fans saying that gotham would not hold any victory parade for the g-men if they were to win the nfc and the forthcoming super bowl. giant fans did not grouse  however  but took action  just as the beloved giants were polishing off a longtime nemesis 17-0. a number of players  like jim burt  also left the playing field at the end of the game and launched themselves into the stands to partake in the fanfestand this was long before the packers ever did that. no. 3 on the countdown: burt delivers knockout vs. niners.  ak-dk from north jersey: great game  total domination. i remember seeing rice running free and inexplicablly dropping that ball. i went from  oh no! to oh yeah! that team devastated opponents throughout the playoffs with mind blowing power. the greatest giants team of the modern era.   joe from new york: id agree with burt on that play: it was not the proudest moment in giants history. montana came into the game like a weakened gazzelle  and it was a common assumption that the giants could win the game by taking montana out. and thats what the win looked likethey took montana out  and they won. retrospectively  they could have won if burt didnt inflict damage on montana. and when i saw the burt hit  it seem intended to do damage to montana. burt didnt let up on it  but went full force  even when he knew he would never get there in time to stop montana from releasing the ball. that is exactly the kind of stuff that has to be discouraged in the nfl today. no. 4 on the countdown: 41-0 victory over the vikings.  fuzzy from new york: i was lucky enough to be at the meadowlands that day. my overriding memory is an anxious pregame crowd and then 2 minutes into the game 70 000 people were chanting  super bowl! super bowl! in retrospect  that game was sean paytons coming out party.  karl p. from brooklyn: that nfc championship game was the giants super bowl that year. but what they did in that game was no small feat  dominated the team that in most peoples minds was the most talented in the conference. fassel and collinss finest hour with the team  without a doubt. no. 5 on the countdown: george martins slow-motion return. shawn davis: with the exception of many of joe morriss bursts up the middle and into the end zone  it seemed to me that everything the giants did that year was in slow motion.  ak-dk: ill never forget big george and harry carson gettin down on the 50 yard line after the super bowl. two good guys who deserve the champagne after years of attrition. no. 6 on the countdown: loss is a victory (the giants fall to the patriots in the 2007 regular-season finale).  michael h.: nearly error free football by both teams made this look like the superbowl preview it was. my most memorable moment was the patriot reaction to the moss touchdown  sheer little boy joy from a team that had been in a pressure cooker created by its own success. no. 8 on the countdown: sehorns interception. ultimatenyg: i was at the (preseason) game that he tore his acl/mcl and i was also there for this highlight reel special. yes  one of the best plays i have ever seen. i remember my jaw dropping  because i could not comprehend what i had seen.. when you are there live you do not have a voice on the tv confirming what you are looking at. so the play is over  the stadium is going nuts and me and my friends are just looking at each other with jaws agape and incredulous eyes. we knew what we saw but we had to give ourselves confirmation that it did happen the way we saw it. we had to watch the replay on the jumbotron to appreciate what we saw. incredible. bakes: definitely one of my all-time favorite plays. about the worst coaching decision fassel ever made was trying sehorn out as a return man. by the way arent we over the whole white cornerback thing by now that it still merits mention? extra point: well have a separate post on the fumble  which had the most reader responses. the new york times will report on the giants and jets throughout the season. you can also find links to coverage from around the league  tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.     the content on the fifth down blog is moving to the pro football page on nytimes.com.readmore     the jets receiver became a critic of the game and its role in american society. but the decision to walk away was also personal.readmore     john idzik  the general manager of the jets  will not retain scott cohen  the assistant general manager. ari nissim  another high-ranking executive  also will depart.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  answers questions from readers.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  will answer questions from readers.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,advertisement by noah johnsondec. 11  2015   creditdaniel weiss         one friday last month  a few dozen skateboarders had gathered at the baseball diamond at tompkins square park in the east village  an area known to local skaters as the t.f. (short for training facility). the unseasonably warm weather has caused a frenzy among skaters who wanted to get as many tricks in as possible before winter. among them was konstantin satchek  the 27-year-old founder of quartersnacks  a revered blog that chronicles the new york skate scene. dressed in a gray hooded sweatshirt  dark trousers and nike skate shoes  mr. satchek is an unassuming and shy figure  but he isnt unknown. newcomers to the park stop to greet him. you run quartersnacks  right? said a skater in his late 20s  who wore a baseball cap and supreme sweatshirt. yes  im kosta  said mr. satchek  who seemed surprised to be recognized. the two chatted briefly about skating and mutual friends  before rolling their separate ways. advertisement quartersnacks celebrates its 10th anniversary this month with a 208-page book  t.f. at 1: ten years of quartersnacks  published by powerhouse books. through hundreds of photos  essays and maps scribbled on napkins and envelopes  it serves as a field guide to a vibrant new york subculture  as well as the language  fashion and rituals that define it. advertisement it is also a eulogy for a specific time and a place in new yorks recent past. those days are gone for me and for most of the city  in all honesty  writes isak buan  an original member of the quartersnacks crew  in one of the books essays. new york has evolved into a newer  sleeker  glass-windowed creature. the streets are paved  bike lanes drawn  skate parks built  this is a childproof version of the city i knew. mr. satchek started quartersnacks in 2005  when he was a high school student in west new york  n.j.  who would take the path train into manhattan to skate. new york  he said  was still shaky from the sept. 11  2001  attacks. after 9/11  it was literally impossible to skate anywhere because of the security  he said. with once-popular skating spots  including a park near 1 police plaza and various plazas in the financial district  now off limits  skaters turned to the t.f. it was a weird couple years after 9/11 to be skating downtown  mr. buan said. there was security everywhere  cameras everywhere  people freaking out. mr. satchek and friends started quartersnacks as a way to connect with other skaters from new york  new jersey and beyond. it reported on the scene at the t.f. and other spots  provided cutting criticism of the skate industry and offered tributes to skate history as well as occasional nods to non-skating-related happenings (mostly references to the new york knicks  rap music and trendy nightclubs). with video-streaming sites like youtube just starting  quartersnacks also became an outlet for sharing short videos that function as calling cards for skaters to showcase their tricks  clothing and music tastes. but the emphasis was on the writing and storytelling. mr. satchek studied journalism at fordham university  and worked briefly as an intern covering local news at the jersey journal. some posts feature funny anecdotes. seven or eight years before katy perry was dancing alongside some sharks for superbowl 49s halftime show  she was at beatrice  putting her number into mike gs flip phone  read a photo caption in february. others feature style. the 30 phattest outfits in skate video history: 1992-2012  read a post in september timed to new york fashion week. advertisement one recurring topic is nostalgia for the pre-internet era  and a reverence for the generations that came before mr. satchek and his friends. a post in october paid tribute to astor place  a former hangout for skaters that has been transformed by luxury residential and office buildings.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. quartersnacks is rare in that it appeals to both the older generation of new york skaters  those who started in the 1980s  and those just discovering the city on a board. i prefer the old  gritty  pre-internet  no-camera-in-your-pocket era of the 90s  when things werent necessarily documented  said jefferson pang  44  one of the first professional skateboarders to come out of new york. (he is currently a sales director for dc shoes.) you heard about things through word of mouth  like folklore. for mr. pang  quartersnacks is an unpolished version of whats being put out by the rest of skateboard media  he said. its more relatable. much has changed in 10 years. the t.f. is still the t.f.  only now the skaters share it with softball and hockey leagues  and the corner bodegas and dollar-slice pizzerias are being replaced by banks and organic food stores. as the sun started to set in the east village  mr. satchek said a round of goodbyes  making plans for later that night. one younger skater wanted to know when he would get his copy of the book. ive got one for you  mr. satchek assured him. skateboarding is just organized hanging out  he said. the purpose of the website  he added  is kind of cataloging the more interesting parts of the day. all those weird little characters  the one crazy kid that was around for two summers that would always make you laugh  are a huge part of it. continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on facebook (styles and modern love)  twitter (styles  fashion  and vows)  and instagram. a version of this article appears in print on december 13  2015  on page st18 of the new york edition with the headline: a decade later  still shredding.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,on saturday night  vanity fair (the american edition) hosted a party at the hotel du cap-eden-roc  just outside cannes  for a star-packed party that ran until 2 a.m.  jennifer lawrence arrived around midnight  just after the producers of the hunger games finished parading her in front of international buyers at a nearby event. sylvester stallone smoked a cigar in the hallway  checked himself out in the mirror and began nodding approvingly at his own reflection.  in the center of the main room was justin bieber  in a mustard-colored leather jacket and jeans.  he exchanged info with jamal al sharif  the head of the dubai film commission  who was promising all sorts of gifts if mr. bieber were to make an appearance. i love dubai  mr. bieber said  his cellphone out.  had any of the celebrities here  who included julianne moore  edward norton  naomi watts  pamela anderson  harrison ford and russell crowe  actually been to a movie this week?  it didnt seem so.  oh no  im not going to the movies  said bryan ferry  who was milling out by the deck  looking at yachts. im staying in the hills. mr. bieber added:  im here to have fun. im here to socialize.  and there was certainly no shortage of opportunities to socialize. the cannes film festival has become one of the years most important marketing opportunities for luxury brands  a kind of mini-superbowl for fashion. scores of top fashion brands are here  doling out free airline tickets  hotels  clothes and even cash to top actresses to strut around in their products.  last thursday  calvin klein co-sponsored a women in film event at a private hillside villa attended by ms. moore  ms. watts  lupita nyongo and rooney mara   all of whom wore the companys dresses and gamely posed for pictures.  on friday  vivienne westwood helped pamela anderson kick off her new foundation. on saturday  giorgio armani sponsored the vanity fair party. and on sunday  chopard took over a  suite at the martinez hotel on the promenade de la croissette for what was billed as an intimate dinner. intimate  in this case  involved giant wall-mounted televisions that showed a loop of uma thurman and cate blanchett in the companys wares. cases of jewelry were lit from above like porsches in a car dealership. colin firth and his wife  livia  co-hosted. and during the meal  a businessman from beijing happily told table mates that his custom-made roberto cavalli dinner jacket cost him 68 000 euros.  it took 11 months to make  he said.  a larger scale chopard gala was scheduled for monday.  related coverage: fashion and beauty at cannes vanessa friedman writes about fashion-related news  from the latest runway shows and trends to an inside look into the design process. contributors include alexandra jacobs  matthew schneier  john koblin and ruth la ferla.     on the runways daily features can now be found at the blogs topics page  as well as at the styles home page.readmore     the designer of the new whitney museum and the fashion house have created a handbag.readmore     they reviewed their supply chains before other fashion sectors  use techno fabrics and know that their target customer cares about the environment. all that adds up to high rankings on sustainability indexes.readmore     the pantone company creates a new shade linked to the summers despicable me spinoff  and all ready for the new royal baby. readmore     he is the only creative director on time magazines 100 most influential people list.readmore follow advertisement 
sports,new york times reporters and editors  including judy battista  greg bishop  tom jolly and justin sablich   provided live analysis from miami gardens  fla.  of super bowl xliv between the colts and the saints.  richard sandomir  contributing from new york   added commentary on the cbs telecast.  the media decoder blog  commented on the super bowl ads here.   update | 10:39 p.m. tracy porter makes his interception sound easy. he said he recognized the play and i just jumped the route. porter was prepared for his big moment: he has sb cut on the left side of his head  the lombardi trophy cut on the left side of his head and the superdome cut in the back. maybe he should have had mvp cut onto the top since he has now made key interceptions in consecutive games against brett favre and peyton manning.  tom jolly update | 10:35 p.m. nate silver looks ahead  via twitter: as always  most of the credit goes to the talent on the field  but this may do for football statistics what red sox 04 did for baseball. update | 10:25 p.m. miles  a commenter on the fifth down  asks: can we now stop all the talk bout peyton manning being the best ever. joe montana never lost a superbowl!  coming into the super bowl  william c. rhoden certainly thought mannings legacy had been overstated.  but people in new orleans arent thinking about mannings legacy right now. bourbon street is alive  which you can see on various web cams.   update | 10:24 p.m. four years ago  who ever wouldve thought this would happen  drew brees said  recalling that much of new orleans was under water  that the super dome was a mess and that the team was playing games in san antonio. he said the saints comeback against the colts was symbolic of how the gulf coast had come back from katrina.   tom jolly update | 10:22 p.m. in his postgame news conference manning says he gives the saints all the credit.  he had little to say about porters interception: he made a good play. he made a heck of a play. thats all i can say. on his way from the stadium to the news conference tent  he gave his mother  olivia  a hug and a kiss and then met jeff saturday  whom he embraced in a bear hug.  tom jolly update | 10:03 p.m. drew brees was named the games most valuable player. no surprise there.  update | 10:01 p.m. with the dual stories of new orleanss recovery from hurricane katrina and the saints long wait to play in the super bowl  cbs should have done more than have two quick shots of bourbon street after the men of who dat? beat the colts. the first postgame reaction shot (of a few seconds) came nearly a minute after time ran out on indianapolis. reaction shots of postgame celebrations of other cities are almost irrelevant  but to give new orleans such shabby treatment was surprising  even more so after jim nantz recited the names of a half dozen streets and parts of the city. one more quick shot of bourbon street came as cbs went to a commercial break.  richard sandomir update | 9:56 p.m. give the saints tremendous credit. this was no fluke: they deserved to win. brees picked apart the colts defense  using the death by a thousand cuts approach  with short passes and the occasional run wearing down the colts defense and then the saints defense coming in for the kill  as it did so many times this season  this time with tracy porter picking off peyton manning and returning the interception for a touchdown. it was the formula that worked all year for the saints and completely appropriate that it would represent the crowning moment for them.  tom jolly  update | 9:52 p.m. its a big day for new orleans  and an especially big one for tracy porter  who along with marlon favorite and three other saints  is from louisiana. as william c. rhoden wrote last week: four members of the national football conference champion saints are louisiana natives. cornerback randall gay is from brusly  favorite is from gretna  wide receiver devery henderson is from opelousas and porter  a cornerback  is from port allen. update | 9:47 p.m. the saints are super bowl champions and will bring the title back to new orleans  which is surely ready for a raucous celebration. tracy porters 74-yard interception return for a touchdown sealed the victory for the saints  but drew brees was the star throughout. he finished 32 of 39 passing for 288 yards  2 touchdowns and no interceptions. the 32 completions ties a super bowl record held by tom brady.  update | 9:45 p.m. the saints stop the colts on downs at the saints 5 and new orleans is going to celebrate its first super bowl victory and first major professional sports championship of any kind. our web producer justin sablich points out that i am now 0-2 in my super bowl point-counterpoint debates with carl nelson since i picked the cardinals to beat the steelers and the colts to beat the saints. at least the cardinals covered the point spread.  tom jolly update | 9:39 p.m. from nate silver on twitter  again (who referred to sean payton as a stathead heartthrob):  however this turns out  weve been on a great run of very exciting super bowls. 7 of the last 11 games have been competitive  4-5 legendary. update | 9:35 p.m. o.k.  now its officially turned into a saints home game  colts fans are just stunned. its going to make it that much tougher for manning to muster up anything late in the fourth quarter.  justin sablich update | 9:33 p.m. itll be interesting to hear that play explained after the game. manning threw it right to tracy porter  but he had to have thought reggie wayne was going to cut toward the middle. instead  wayne stopped and porter had clear sailing  74 yards to the end zone and who dat chants are echoing around the stadium.  tom jolly update | 9:32 p.m. tracy porters 74-yard interception return puts the saints up  31-17. porter was also the player who picked off brett favre to seal the n.f.c. championship game victory against minnesota.  update | 9:29 p.m. a sign of how tight the defenses have played: the longest plays tonight have been 27-yard pass receptions by dallas clark and marques colston. only one other play has gone for more than 19 yards: a 26-yard run by addai.  tom jolly update | 9:27 p.m. from the boston globe  via twitter: freeney is walking off the field  into locker room.  update | 9:24 p.m. with drew brees killing the colts with short passes  simms summarized the plight for the indianapolis defense this way: theyre used to their pass rush getting to the quarterback  but they keep seeing one look after another  another formation  another short pass  so you get to where you react  youre not attacking. and drew brees is right on time with those throws. during the drive that put new orleans ahead  brees had complete passes of  in order  12  5  6  8  8  6  9 and 2 yards (the touchdown to jeremy shockey).  richard sandomir update | 9:23 p.m. whoa  i think everyone in the stadium was shocked by the 2-point reversal. here  it didnt look like moore was ever in  but now that theyre showing the replay its clear he was. even without the reversal on the conversion ruling  that drive was the kind that wins games: nine plays  59 yards  7 for 7 passing and the longest play in the drive is the first  a 12-yard run by reggie bush. both teams have missed scoring changes  with the saints leaving points on the field after failing on fourth down in the second quarter and stover missing that field goal moments ago. more and more this looks like a game that could come down to the last possession  or overtime. can manning do something memorable  or is this the saints year?  tom jolly  update | 9:20 p.m. was it right to go for 2? even the old-school chart that dick vermeil created said you go for it. new thinking would also agree  judy battista broke down the whole issue last week. update | 9:10 p.m. stovers missed field goal wastes the colts successful gamble on fourth-and-2. i thought the fourth quarter would be an enormous challenge for the saints defense  because the colts up-tempo attack tends to wear down opponents and they then pull away in the final minutes. but the saints offense has been an enormous help by hanging onto the ball for extended periods  even if they have only been able to score one touchdown. since the first quarter  the saints have had the ball for more than 20 minutes while the colts have had it for just over 10.  tom jolly  update | 9:09 p.m. matt stovers wayard 51-yard field-goal attempt is just the latest in a season filled with them. before the playoffs  judy battista looked at kickers sudden inaccuracy this season. now the saints have the ball in colts territory with a chance to take the lead.  update | 9:00 p.m. from aaron schatz of football outsiders  via twitter: all these addai is great tweets. have you people not seen the saints run defense this year?   update | 8:57 p.m. cbs did everything right in the way it covered the saints on-side kick to start the second half  the audio of the frantic scene was especially good. back in super bowl i  a very different kickoff situation occurred. nbcs charlie joness interview with bob hope went so long that the network went to a commercial and missed the kickoff. cbs was also covering the game but it showed the kickoff. incredibly  it was redone.  richard sandomir update | 8:56 p.m. this is evolving into the offensive battle that was predicted  sort of. the catch is that the saints are sputtering past midfield and its becoming a showcase for garrett hartley  who now has three field goals  from 46  44 and 47 yards. so the saints have scored four times to the colts three  but getting 3 points on 3 of those 4 scoring drives doesnt seem like a winning formula against manning.  tom jolly update | 8:53 p.m. saints kicker garrett hartley  who just made a 47-yard field goal to pull new orleans within 17-16  is an early candidate for the games most valuable player  along with dallas clark and joseph addai of the colts. that could change if a saints defender forces a turnover. on the colts kickoff return  irsay buries his head in his hands in his head. indianapolis take over on their own 11. how many more long drives does manning have in him?  william c. rhoden update | 8:48 p.m. back to nate silver  who understands the value of knowing probabilities. he has already posted an article about sean paytons decision to go for the touchdown on fourth down. silvers take? it was the right call.  update | 8:44 p.m. and  thats an answer. impressive 89-yard drive by the colts  with manning going to the no-huddle attack and driving indianapolis 76 yards. he completed 5 of 6 passes and it looks more and more like the colts put adrian peterson in addais uniform. whoever is wearing no. 29 gained 20 more yards on that drive and now has 79 through two-and-a-half quarters  a yard under his season high for a complete game.  tom jolly update | 8:43 p.m. joseph addai  who bounced off several saints defenders on his way to the end zone moments ago  has 79 yards rushing. two more and he will surpass his high game for rushing this season (80 yards versus the jets in the a.f.c. championship).  update | 8:42 p.m. the saints have been able to move the ball well  but with no help from their running game. they have just 29 yards on the ground. but so far  brees has been able to work around it. something to keep in mind as they start this drive.  justin sablich update | 8:40 p.m. happy times have returned to the colts luxury box. the colts score on joseph addais tough 4-yard run to take a 17-13 lead. in the next booth over  jim irsay is up  slapping high-fives again.  william c. rhoden  update | 8:36 p.m. from greg bishop  via twitter:  beautiful throw from #colts qb peyton manning to te dallas clark. looked effortless  in the smallest window.  the colts are driving deep in saints territory.  update | 8:32 p.m. richard sandomir has a last thought on the halftime show: i dont profess to be a musical expert  but i am an authority on baldness. i am bald and wrote bald like me. so  i wonder  what is it in the dna or lifestyle of aging (and ancient) rock stars that so many still have lots of hair? consider these recent rockin half-time geezers: roger daltrey of the whos got hair (much too much for his age). pete townsends got some but not a lot (he wore a hat tonight at the super bowl). but look at paul mccartney  bruce springsteen  tom petty  prince and bono: all have lots of hair. bonos u2 teammate  the edge  is bald  thanks goodness. and there arent a lot of bald football announcers  either. update | 8:30 p.m. after looking so uncertain in the first quarter  the saints are back on their game  and in the lead by 13-10  with brees firing short passes all over the field and devery henderson and thomas cutting through the colts defense for extra yardage. just like that  the onus is on manning to answer.  tom jolly update | 8:29 p.m. who was that who scored? i meant  who dat? (it was pierre thomas on a 16-yard pass play from drew brees) sun life stadium is officially jumping and the saints lead  13-10  with 11:41 to go in the third quarter.  william c. rhoden  update | 8:27 p.m. sean payton is leaving nothing on the table. that failed attempt on fourth down didnt deter him from trying an onside kick to start the second half and it worked. given the colts propensity for scoring to start the second half  the gamble was reminiscent of bill belichicks decision to go for it on fourth down against the colts deep in the patriots own territory earlier this season. youve got to figure the colts will score points; the trick is getting enough extra possessions to stay with them. and thats just what payton did.  tom jolly update | 8:25 p.m. the saints certainly didnt get the ball without a fight after that onside kick. so what happens at the bottom of the pile? sports illustrated had an entertaining read a few years ago. update | 8:24 p.m. wow! first major break for new orleans. first  the saints go for it on fourth-and goal in the waning moments of the first half and get stuff. now  they recover an on-side kick to start the second half.  william c. rhoden update | 8:23 p.m. lets see if cbss bill cowher is right  that the saints defensive coordinator gregg williams will come out of halftime with some sort of new defensive scheme that he will spring on peyton manning in the second half. of course cowher doesnt have to be correct. hes a coach-turned-studio analyst. but as a super bowl-winning coach with the steelers  you want him to be able to read williamss mind and correctly predict that he will throw something at manning that he didnt want to show during the first two quarters.  richard sandomir update | 8:20 p.m. they set up the big stage for the who in 10 minutes. it is circular  with green streams of light radiating out from the middle. pete townshend is wearing shades and a hat. roger daltrey is wearing a black sport coat with wide white vertical stripes. they open with a short bit of pinball wizard. next is a longer take of baba oriley. those who find the who pretentious are allowed to voice that thought during this one  but its kind of nice to see daltrey on the harmonica in a nice instrumental segment. now  they segue to who are you? with the words of the title on the signboard around the stadium. sure hope they do some really old and cool tunes like the kids are all right. or maybe cant explain. but  no  alas  its see me  feel me . . .  from tommy.  even those of us who like the who a lot found this rock opera to be a bit much. thankfully  they only nod in its direction for a few bars before jumping into a fireworks-laden up-tempo anthem wont get fooled again. karen crouse  sitting next to me  assures me it is her favorite and shes moving and grooving to it. just like yesterday! and i get on my knees and pray! (daltreys turning into gene wilder! karen said.)  now  were at the two-minute warning of the halftime show. will they do one more song or this is it? no  i think thats it. meet the new boss  same as the old boss! and its over. fireworks! cheers! back to football.  joe lapointe update | 8:19 p.m. here is one less-than-stellar review for the halftime show. from tyler kepner  the timess national baseball writer  via twitter: people rip mlb for a lot of things  but they got jay-z and alicia keys to perform at the world series. the whos a bit past their prime  no? update | 8:16 p.m. over at pro-football-reference.com  neil paine drilled down into the numbers before the game. if anything  the odds should be leaning towards new orleans. (thanks to footballoutsiders.com). update | 8:15 p.m. share your thoughts on the halftime performance by the who.  update | 8:13 p.m. i walked in the stadium this afternoon with dan rooney  the united states ambassador to ireland. rooney is headed back to ireland later this week. he said he spent his days entertaining and hosting dignitaries. he also said he wasnt happy with the way some teams have been taking liberties with the rooney rule. as we reached the entrance a young man checked rooneys credential and said hmmm  steelers. informed that the elderly man with the short  white hair owned the steelers  the young man recoiled and said really?!  william c. rhoden update | 8:02 p.m. over at media decoder  were asking people for their favorite super bowl commercial so far. share your thoughts. update | 7:57 p.m. and now  the dreaded halftime show.  the who. who? the who. no  i mean who? the who. forget it.  william c. rhoden update | 7:53 p.m. what  it took the saints two minutes of a timeout to plan a running play like that? you would think the saints would try for a field goal but no. after yet another long time to think during a timeout  coach payton calls for another run on fourth down and it fails. so the saints come out of a great scoring chance with nothing  not even a field goal. sometimes  a coach can out-coach himself. wont get fooled again? after the colts fail to get a first down  there is another timeout with 46 seconds left. this could have been a reggie bush moment.  bush takes it at the 44 of the saints but  no  not much. his return went for five yards. this game could use a bush moment. thirty-five seconds left in the half. brees passes  complete. they move it down to the 33 of the colts. im looking out at the field for bush. he runs a pass pattern short but hes just a decoy. completion moves the ball to the 27 of the colts. another timeout. eleven seconds left. hey  payton! hey  brees! what about reggie! reggie lines up left  pass to reggie! out of bounds. short gain. five seconds left after a short gain. field-goal attempt from 44 yards. spotted. booted. up and good!  and its 10-6 at the end of the half  colts lead.  bring on the who!  joe lapointe update | 7:53 p.m.  when the saints mike bell slipped on the turf on a third-and-1 play late in the second quarter  phil simms insisted that it occurred because of his sharp cutting. but enough players have slipped on the grass at sun life stadium for cbss sideline reporters  steve tasker and solomon wilcots  to investigate whether the turf is slippery or whether there are other reasons for the players falling without being hit.  richard sandomir update | 7:51 p.m. heres what i dont understand. if the biggest games are won by the best players  and the saints best player is quarterback drew brees  and the saints are driving  down only  10-3  and near the goal line  why would a coach take the ball out of breess hands? thats exactly what sean payton did. he handed the ball to pierre thomas on second down  to mike bell on third down and to thomas again on fourth down. why? the colts ran off the field after that stop like they had won the football game. and maybe  just maybe  they already had. i like the call to go for it on fourth down. but  and this is just one opinion  brees should have factored in the outcome.  greg bishop update | 7:48 p.m. even though the colts held at the 1  that saints drive showed brees at his patient  crafty best. the colts safeties have been squeezing the middle of the field and rather than forcing passes into that area  brees has been dumping short passes into the flat  relying on his receivers to turn them into gains in the open field. lance moore did just that on a pass to the left that he caught just past the line of scrimmage and turned into a 21-yard gain. when the colts adjusted and shifted safety melvin bullitt toward the flat  brees hit colston for 27 yards along the right hash marks. strange then  that the saints elected to run the ball on third and fourth down from the 1. the saints held the ball for 6 minutes 45 seconds and although they came away with no points  they may have gained some game-plan confidence.  tom jolly update | 7:46 p.m. very nice spot by jim nantz. with new orleans facing a second-and-17 on the colts 30  nantz saw something wrong. colston in a slot to the right  he said  and paused slightly  then said  left unattended  and there he is  colston  breaking a tackle  down to the 3. and there a mixup in the colts defense. he was just off on a wing to the right and nobody was on him. the 27-yard pass play extended the saints drive  which ended without a score when the colts defense stopped new orleans on a fourth-and-1 running play.  richard sandomir  update | 7:45 p.m. jim irsay  in the next box  jumps up and pumps fist as the colts hold by stopping pierre thomas short of the end zone. william c. rhoden update | 7:43 p.m. the saints were just stuffed on a fourth-and-goal from the 1. was it the right call to go for it with less than two minutes left in the half? share your thoughts.  update | 7:41 p.m. nate silver  of baseball stats fame and now uncannily accurate political seer  made an observation before the game  via twitter: throw out weeks 16  17 and count playoffs: colts have scored 444 points & allowed 268 (+176); saints have scored 559  allowed 340 (+219). silvers advice: take the points. update | 7:37 p.m. oh my. lance moore of the saints was as open as a receiver ever gets. the saints are back on our end of the field  first-and-10 at the 23. but they lose seven on a reverse. they tried one last game against minnesota and lost one yard on a double reverse to reggie bush. but coltson gets 27 on a pass reception and here are the saints on the 3-yard line right down in front of us. im looking out over the backs of the colts defenders. i see them flow to the ball on a pass that gains nothing. they come out of the huddle with three wideouts to the left  then move one to the right  then a flag falls for illegal procedure as a lineman jumped. you sort of get the feeling they are out smarting themselves. now  three wideouts left again  motion right  a running play to pierre thomas down to the 1. all that showing of pass and that motion for a running play. pivotal moment here. two-minute warning. and well be back  right after this.  joe lapointe update | 7:32 p.m. they just showed a promo for the who  the halftime entertainment. yeah  im geeked for it. ill admit it. maybe not as geeked as judy battista was last year for bruce springsteen  but pretty geeked nonetheless. got to walk with roger daltrey the other day after the news conference. he is  shall i say it  a fellow man of average height. nice to know that. daltrey was much wittier and friendlier than pete townshend. as homer simpson once said after meeting paul mccartney: rock stars. is there anything they dont know?  joe lapointe update | 7:30 p.m. i have a birds-eye view of the colts owner and c.e.o. jim irsay  who is sitting three feet away in a luxury box. irsay was up giving high-fives in the first quarter as the colts put up 10 points. things have been subdued in the irsay box thus far in the second quarter.  william c. rhoden update | 7:27 p.m. some of us on team times are sitting in the middle deck of the grandstands  in the corner of the end zone  looking over peyton mannings right shoulder as he runs this drive out of our end in the middle of the second quarter. you find yourself trying to read his mind and see things through his eyes as he waits for the snap and surveys the defense. can you see what he sees? oh! i just saw pierre garcon get open and then drop a pass. he was so open i could have thrown it to him from my seat here in row 7 of section 249. and now the colts punt and the saints will come back this way. its chilly here  for florida. my fingers are stiff from the air. but this is no complaint.  this is a wonderful way to make a living.  joe lapointe update | 7:25 p.m. the saints defense has been opportunistic this season  stripping the ball  playing for turnovers  including interceptions. darren sharper had nine interceptions and ran back three for touchdowns. a play like that would electrify this game. of course  it is not easy to do such things against peyton manning.  joe lapointe update | 7:22 p.m. if youre a saints fan and youre looking for some signs of hope  heres one: last year  the steelers totally dominated the cardinals in the first quarter  outgaining them 140 yards to 13 and taking a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter. the cardinals got it together in the second quarter and ended up with 407 total yards. of course  in the end  the steelers won  so maybe thats not such a great sign after all.  tom jolly update | 7:19 p.m. dwight freeneys sack of drew brees on third-and-3 was emphatic  a one-handed fling to the ground. it was the sort of play that leaves a lingering impression. the saints were lucky to get 3 points out of the drive  which ended with garrett hartleys 46-yard field goal to make the score 10-3. wonder if the saints will be thinking about freeney on the next drive? his injury  would he play or not?  was the biggest football-related issue of the week.  joe lapointe  update | 7:18 p.m. dwight freeney just had his first impact play of the game  sacking drew brees. heres judy battistas take:  wow  freeney. what power. one handed sack. so much for that ankle problem. that was an insane sack. update | 7:14 p.m. the first quarter was filled with quickly-rendered and smart analysis by cbss phil simms. early on  he has seen his view vindicated that the colts  who are ranked last in the league in rushing  would be able to run on the saints.  late in the first quarter  on a colts drive that started on their own 4-yard line  joseph addai ran for 26 yards. and simms said: the saints had to know this play was coming. he said that new orleans was well aware that in short-yardage situations  indianapolis loves the inside trap and thats what it was  and how about that? joseph addai  the blockings great upfront  and he makes sharper miss.  richard sandomir update | 7:13 p.m. the colts 96-yard touchdown drive tied for the longest in super bowl history and peyton manning didnt even look like he was working all that hard. the colts got the benefit of a 26-yard joseph addai run up the middle on third-and-1 from midfield  but manning was pinpoint perfect in the first quarter. the colts have 154 yards in the first half and the real shocker is their balance. they had 66 yards rushing and 88 passing and are 4 of 5 on third down. worst of all for the saints: they held the ball for 10:29. and gregg williams prediction that they would put some remember me hits on manning? not even close.  judy battista update | 7:11 p.m. joseph addai already has run for 58 yards against the saints  that wasnt supposed to happen. his season-high was 80 yards rushing in the a.f.c. championship game against the jets and even the colts acknowledged that they were mystified about the shortcomings of their running game. if addai keeps eating up yardage on the ground  its going to be that much more difficult for the saints to pressure manning  something theyre still not succeeding in doing.  tom jolly update | 7:10 p.m. the first quarter belonged to the colts. they had a 21-10 advantage in plays  a 154-36 advantage in total yards and  of course  a 10-0 advantage on the scoreboard.  update | 7:05 p.m. the colts took a 10-0 lead on a 19-yard touchdown pass from manning to pierre garcon  prompting this reaction from judy battista on twitter:  wow. 96 yard drive like it was nothing. manning is pinpoint perfect.  she also reports that the colts owner jim irsay is no longer so fidgety.  update | 6:59 p.m. a little surprising that the saints offense seems a bit out of kilter. drew brees is getting plenty of time  but the saints went three-and-out on their first possession and brees overthrew marques colston on a deep pass when colston was open. on their second series  they moved the ball better and colston dropped a pass that could have resulted in a big play and brees is only 3 of 7 so far.  tom jolly update | 6:57 p.m. peyton manning isnt the only one who moves around a lot before plays  at least according to judy battista:  jim irsay in the box right next to me. hes pretty fidgety. update | 6:56 p.m. a clarification on adam vinatieri. he is on the colts 53-man roster  but is inactive for tonights game and cant play. its stover time in indianapolis! update | 6:54 p.m. the saints look a bit tentative on offense early  which is exactly how they looked early against minnesota in the national football conference championship game as well. i dont think it will last all day. but drew brees needs a bit more help. on the saints second drive  he threw twice to receiver marques colston  and both times  it appeared colston had a good chance or better of catching a pass. the first  he flat out dropped. the second  he could not come up with while fighting with safety melvin bullitt for position. either way  if the saints are going to beat manning and the colts  they need to score. and dropping passes isnt going to do it. brees is so far 3 of 7 for 27 yards  most on a long gain by running back reggie bush.  greg bishop  update | 6:51 p.m. matt stovers time in the spotlight continues. heres an interesting tweet from sports illustrateds peter king: amazing thing. vinatieris on the 53-man roster. and stovers kicking. matt stover has made the best clutch kicker of our time obsolete. update | 6:49 p.m. greg bishop  via twitter: colts kicker matt stover is the oldest player in the nfl. and also the first person to score in super bowl xliv. update | 6:47 p.m. the saints talked all week about delivering remember me hits to quarterback peyton manning  as they did to kurt warner and brett favre in their two playoff victories  but they didnt lay a remember me finger on manning on the colts first possession. manning completed 6 of 8 passes  and one of the misfires could have been caught  on the 58-yard drive that resulted in a 38-yard field goal by matt stover and a 3-0 colts lead.  tom jolly  update | 6:45 p.m. tom jolly  via twitter: not sure if saints fans are here in greater numbers  but its clear theyre louder  so far.  update | 6:18 p.m. | from tom jolly one of the iconic images of football is of linemen preparing to square off  facemask to facemask  with one hand dug into the turf in a three-point stance  but commissioner roger goodell said on sunday that it was conceivable such showdowns could be prohibited. goodell told bob schieffer on cbss face the nation that the league was continuing to assess ways to make the game safer  especially in reducing head injuries and  in response to a question from schieffer  said  youll see a lot of players that never get down in the three-point stance  so its possible that that would happen.  sam from roanoke  va. the interview took place on the field at sun life stadium  where super bowl xliv was to be played sunday night and goodell made a point of saying that the league itself had commissioned the study that found that former football players were more susceptible to dementia than the ordinary population  though he later said it had limitations because it was a phone survey rather than a medical study. nonetheless  he said: its caused us to say  lets go back and see if there is something here that we need to understand better  for many years the culture had been quite different  that concussions werent serious injuries. i think we have changed that culture and made sure that people understand they are serious and they can have serious consequences if theyre not treated properly; especially if theyre not treated properly. we have changed the game and we have changed the culture. and i think the rules changes that weve made over the last several years have made the game safer for our players. we need to continue to find new ways. there are techniques that are in the game that we think can lead to more serious injuries. whether they are head injuries  the high hits to the head  weve done a lot of changes to defenseless receivers to make sure that players that are in the position are not subject to hits that can cause serious injuries. update | 5:56 p.m. | from justin sablich there might not be as much of a home-crowd advantage for the saints as i originally thought. the crowd is a lot more evenly split than i expected. unless some last-minute saints tailgaters fill in the remaining seats  its looking pretty even right now.  update | 5:48 p.m. | from richard sandomir cbs sports is working very  very hard for its high-paying sponsors. it has integrated pizza hut  monster.com and ritz  which have each sponsored an hour of the pre-super bowl show  into the program. the effort has been shameless and ridiculous. in the 5 oclock hour sponsored by callaway  cbs just had the golf equipment makers most prominent endorser  phil mickelson  whack two balls  marked indy and n.o.  down a fairway with a diablo edge driver  to predict the winner. lefty hit the n.o. ball the longest. and it all looked very awkward. it might have been a more creative sponsored segment if he had used the 20-year-old  square-grooved ping eye 2 wedge that scott mccarron recently criticized him for using. but then  of course  it wouldnt have been about callaway. update | 5:31 p.m. | from richard sandomir bill cowhers jailhouse interview with the former giant plaxico burress on cbss super bowl pregame show was generally well done and  asked the core question  about the prominence of athletes and handguns. but the segment would have been better without the opening embrace between the men or cowher concluding by saying  no one is pulling for you more than i am  and i said before  its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up. in such a serious situation  emotional distance is better (or  at least  sentiments like that are better expressed off-camera); burresss regret over discharging an unlicensed handgun  and wounding himself  in a new york city nightclub was believable and powerful enough without cowhers feelings being so upfront. one lingering question: where were cowher and burress? despite showing cowher entering the prison  i never heard him say where he was. did anybody hear him identify the prison?  update | 5:26 p.m. | from greg bishop the most analyzed limb in football finally hit the field here before super bowl xliv. there was dwight freeney and his famous ankle  and for the first time this week  there was freeney running  in the end zone. it was hard not to read into what freeney looked like. he warmed up for around 10 minutes. he ran  mostly straight ahead. he tested his movement from his three-point stance. and he looked  well  normal  at least for those of us reporters playing unofficial doctors of observation. freeney looked quick. he looked strong. most important  on his final warm-up run  he zigged and zagged and appeared to test the ankle. afterward  he did not limp. does this mean freeney is healthy? no. but could he have an impact in super bowl xliv? that seems more likely than it did this afternoon. update | 5:09 p.m. | from richard sandomir the anti-abortion ad featuring tim tebow and his mother  pam  that generated so much opposition before it was ever seen  has already run twice on cbss pre-super bowl show. to me  its very blandness helped it deflate the controversy. you clearly knew what its message was; just as clearly  you can see why cbs accepted the advocacy ad. produced by the conservative christian group focus on the family  pam tebow said in the ad that she called tim my miracle baby because he almost didnt make it into this world. i remember almost losing him. now that hes an adult  she said  i still worry about his health. to me  hes just my baby. it ended with the tag-line: celebrate life. celebrate family.  update | 4:53 p.m. | from greg bishop most of the official super bowl xliv events took place in and around fort lauderdale. but true super bowl opulence was about 30 minutes away  a short drive south to miami and south beach and $50 parking lots. last year  at the super bowl in tampa  i accompanied the prolific new york times writer john branch for a piece he wrote on the maxim party and how inside that building  life did not mirror the struggling economy. this year figured to be no different  but in reality  super bowl parties on south beach were somehow bigger  crazier  more indulgent  more extreme. on saturday night  maxim held its party at the raleigh hotel on collins avenue. it would be easier to list who was not there than to list who was. among those the fifth down spied in its quest for celebrity journalism (and an adult beverage or two): paul mitchell  robert horry  evander holyfield  larry fitzgerald and tom arnold. the official list included a host of other celebrities. among them: asher roth  brody jenner  floyd mayweather  kendra wilkinson  russell simmons  pete yorn and wilmer valderrama. maxim centered its party around the hotel pool. bands performed on a stage that was surrounded by sand  including those guys who do that song shots. a group called lmfao. holyfield spent at least 30 minutes on the dance floor. jermaine dupri served as dj. even ordinary joes (read: reporters or people who spent $1 600 on a ticket) walked the catwalk. the same people who ran maxim also ran three nights of parties at hotel 944 at eden roc. common  drake  wyclef and snoop dog all performed there. those spotted in attendance included: the williams sisters  tyson beckford  joel madden  julius irving  michael strahan and javon walker. logistically this was different than most super bowls  which are usually held in one city  for parties and interviews and everything. here  the revelers needed to head south. once there  they found super bowl opulence at its finest.  update | 4:42 p.m. | from greg bishop the power of the no. 44 was not lost on two men who wore it during their n.f.l. careers. certainly not on this week  of all weeks  when both were voted into the hall of fame. lets see: floyd little played running back for the denver broncos. he wore no. 44. dick lebeau played cornerback for the detroit lions. he also wore no. 44. both waited an abnormally long time to gain entry into the hall of fame. both made it one day before super bowl xliv (or 44)  in the first term of the 44th president (barack obama)  with 44 members of the hall of fame committee voting. little even offered to pay lebeaus way down to fort lauderdale  fla.  for the hall of fame voting and festivities. i told you three weeks ago that i hope the 44s are reunited  lebeau said. on saturday  they were linked forever  by both jersey number and entry into the hall of fame.  update | 4:35 p.m. | from richard sandomir super bowl pregame shows create absurd juxtapositions. shortly after 4 p.m. eastern  cbs carried perhaps the best musical segment ever shown on a super bowl pregame program: wynton marsaliss tribute to new orleans  jazz and the saints. the great trumpeter showed he is also a great wordsmith and narrator  mixing his music with evocative phrases. you ever wait for something for so long that the waiting becomes the something? he asked about the decades it took the saints to reach the super bowl. he said that people brag about surviving tragedy  like the hurricanes betsy and camille  which are discussed like people. but he said  nobody brags on katrina; she swept over here like death on high horse.  beautiful stuff.  genius  james brown proclaimed. but rather than leave for a break on marsaliss memorable notes  brown shifted quickly to a ridiculous promo to hype up another pre-game sponsor  pizza hut. its a big day for pizza lovers  he said  adding that pizza hut has 120 000 employees; expects to sell 1.7 million pizzas today (enough to cover 45 football fields) and that 60 percent of americans will ask for pepperoni as a topping. to which any right-minded viewer should ask: who cares?  update | 4:04 p.m. | from tom jolly in miami gardens  fla. count a sense of humor among the attributes of the indianapolis colts: * mike murphy  the colts linebackers coach  who for years has had a squad of players under 6-feet tall  said he told general manager bill polian that he couldnt take them to disney world even if the team won the super bowl. they arent tall enough to get on the rides  he said. * colts guard ryan lilja said he got a quick introduction to the offensive lines tradition of fining their fellow players for misdeeds  real or imagined  and an equally quick lesson in the futility of appealing the fines. after the chiefs released him and he was signed by the colts six years ago  his suitcase arrived at the training center with a chiefs luggage tag on it. he was told he was getting a $100 fine. i said  i just got here. i didnt even have time to change it. they said  all right  $200 fine.   update | 3:57 p.m. | from richard sandomir yes  cbss embrace of ritz was inane. but cbs has also offered substantial segments.  judy battista via twitter the standout has been james browns lengthy report on the survival of new orleanians after hurricane katrina. while brown could not equal the stunning impact of spike lees 2006 documentary  when the levees broke  he and his producer movingly conveyed the frustration of residents with the glacial pace of governmental help to rebuild the lower ninth ward and the parallel love they feel for the saints. an 87-year-old man stood where where his house once was and told brown what he would tell a city official: tell em i need help. any help i can get. they gave me such a hard time. working all my life  paying taxes. i dont understand it. dick enberg pulled on viewers heartstrings  as he often does  with his report on the intertwined lives of two arkansas high school football players who never met each other. one of them moved from one school to another of a failed drug test and honored the memory of the other who died in a traffic accident. nicely done without being too emotional. cbs could have extended a short report on the players of haitian heritage playing in the super bowl and their plans to help the country in its time of need.  update | 3:52 p.m. | from justin sablich in miami gardens  fla. arriving at sun life stadium on sunday afternoon  it was much easier to spot a saints jersey than a colts one as fans streamed in. the saints have been established as the sentimental favorites heading into super bowl xliv  and this should be reflected in the stands.  will having a home-crowd advantage give the saints a significant boost? it certainly wont hurt.  update | 3:35 p.m. | from richard sandomir within its first hour  it was clear that cbss super bowl pregame show was just like nearly every one of its predecessors. to fill out the always-inflated program (four hours for cbs)  the network must descend into silliness. cbs played corporate footsie with ritz crackers  which sponsored the first hour of the show. one segment found boomer esiason at the ritz tailgate party and with the the ritz marching band; then  at the cbs super bowl today desk at sun life stadium  esiason stuffed his mouth to overflow with ritz crackers. ritz was already getting its moneys worth when the cbs pregame crew (with esiason at the grill) joined the food network chef guy fieri for still more pregame tailgating  where everything (cream cheese  sour cream  shrimp  bacon  buffalo wings  meatballs  jalapeno peppers and  i think  dan marino and bill cowher)  fit on ritzes (ritzi?). ritz hasnt gotten this much publicity since andy griffith told us: everything tastes better when it sits on a ritz. id love to see if ritz is the cracker du jour on cbss nfl today when it isnt sponsoring the show. clearly  boomer likes them. update | 3:00 p.m. | from tom jolly in miami gardens:  despite the saints long history of futility  linebacker scott fujita said he did not believe the team would fall back into mediocrity after their super bowl dream season. fujita  an outspoken eight-year n.f.l. veteran who signed with the saints in 2006  said he was convinced coach sean payton had changed the teams culture for good. bringing in better talent was a crucial part of the transformation  but fujita said paytons influence ran deeper than that.  judy battista via twitter we have a great locker room  he said. there are no knuckleheads. there are no cancers. there are no problem guys you have to worry about. its a bunch of great guys who have come from all over the place. together  they form a really great team with great chemistry. payton became head coach in 2006 and  that same year  the saints signed fujita and drew brees as free agents and drafted running back reggie bush  safety roman harper  guard jahri evans and receiver marcus colston. the saints have played in the n.f.c. championship game twice in the four seasons since  losing to the bears  39-14  on jan. 21  2007  and beating the vikings  30-27  this season. (coincidentally  the colts won the a.f.c. championship both of those seasons.)  fujita said the saints blend of youth and experience bodes well for the future. he said he believed that the 31-year-old brees had at least five more good seasons in him and that defensive end will smith and cornerback jabari greer are hitting their prime. in addition to the 2006 draft choices  a host of other young players fill the saints roster  including running backs mike bell and pierre thomas  receiver robert meachem and cornerback malcolm jenkins. its fun going to work at a place with a bunch of guys who have a shared vision  fujita said. the saints drive to the super bowl was especially fun  of course  and fujita said it reminded him of a visit he and his wife had made to paris a few years ago: france had just beaten brazil to win the world cup. the whole city was celebrating and a huge crowd gathered in the champ-elyses. my wife and i were talking about whether there was any event and any city in america where that kind of celebration could occur. new orleans these past two weeks is that place. update | 2:32 p.m. | from justin sablich in miami gardens: in the week leading up to super bowl xliv  players and coaches of both the colts and the saints played down the fact that the saints will be playing in their first super bowl while the colts have been here before. i dont think thats an advantage at all  colts coach jim caldwell said.  it doesnt matter that weve been here before. it doesnt matter that we have 25 guys on our team that have actually been through this process before. what really counts is when we kick that ball off on sunday. but the last eight teams to make their super bowl debut have a record of 2-6  going back to 1994. the last team to win in their first super bowl was the tampa bay buccaneers in 2002. its only an advantage if we let them make it an advantage  saints linebacker jonathan vilma said. will the colts super bowl experience play a major role in todays game? the new york times will report on the giants and jets throughout the season. you can also find links to coverage from around the league  tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.     the content on the fifth down blog is moving to the pro football page on nytimes.com.readmore     the jets receiver became a critic of the game and its role in american society. but the decision to walk away was also personal.readmore     john idzik  the general manager of the jets  will not retain scott cohen  the assistant general manager. ari nissim  another high-ranking executive  also will depart.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  answers questions from readers.readmore     judy battista  the n.f.l. reporter for the times  will answer questions from readers.readmore follow advertisement

sports,updated  july 8  11:30 p.m. | yoshiaki sato  a scholar based in japan  joins our discussion and notes jacksons contribution to the visual culture of pop music. as crowds gathered in los angeles on tuesday morning for michael jacksons memorial  sections of freeways were shut down as the funeral procession made its way to the staples center. more than 1.6 million people registered online to win tickets to the service. several european broadcasters cleared their schedules to show the event in prime time. in death  michael jacksons celebrity seems likely to exceed his popularity even at the height of his fame. given his musical legacy  is this reaction overblown or deserved? does this spectacle say something beyond a public fascination with his story and the ability of his managers to turn a funeral into a superbowl-like event?    john mcwhorter  a senior fellow at the manhattan institute  is the author of our magnificent bastard tongue: the untold story of english.  we got over ed mcmahon a good while ago now  and the scattering of farrah fawcett magazine covers already looks a little 10 minutes ago. what keeps us from getting over michael jackson is partly  of all things  his blankness. the surgery  the falsetto speech and the costumes were someone keeping himself at a distance. we saw a ghost who could sing up a storm and dance better  but so weightlessly in both cases  with the airy voice and always the moonwalking. he was so willfully nonspecific that he became a distillation of brilliance of no race  gender or age  just mesmerizing. his art inhabited the real world only in a gestural sense. lets face it  as good as the songs are  the person snarling beat it has never been in a fight  and its hard to imagine the singer of billie jean fathering anything. all of america could love him  because he made sure not to actually be anyone. it was a fascinating trick and it sticks with us. and what he put himself through to pull it off makes his passing even harder to get over. to black people  the bleaching and chiseling was the tragic self-negating behavior of our wide-nosed boy singer with an afro  grown up and lost. but whites have opened up to blackness to such an extent that they were often just as dismayed by the surgery. cosby became a runaway hit  will smith became hollywoods biggest star  hip hop went mainstream  america elected a black president  and michael died looking like greta garbo. sixty years ago most whites would have wondered why more black stars didnt do what he did. today they mourn him as someone who couldnt face what he was  because they would have loved that  too  or at least given it a shot. in that  our current michael-mania  like obamas election  embodies what america in 2009 is all about.  margo jefferson  a former culture critic for the times and winner of the pulitzer prize for criticism  is a professor at eugene lang college  the new school for liberal arts. she is the author of on michael jackson. a simple fact: our reaction to any and every celebrity death is overblown. the media and its consumers (we the fans  the spectators  the commentators  even the dissenters busily blogging their disapproval) are locked into a feverish ritual. its elements? true grief  a certain relief (we wont have to keep worrying about his life)  and pure voyeurism. (bring on every seedy detail and speculation!)  an embarrassing fact: the ritual of alternately mourning and gossiping about a dead celebrity is a shamelessly welcome relief from knotty political and economic issues. a friend of mine saw a headline that read: michael jacksons death is bad for iran.  it was. that being said  when it comes to great pop culture  which all the world cares for  is there any more spectacular figure? michael jackson the entertainer contained multitudes. he was part of the soul-music tradition that included james brown  jackie wilson  smokey robinson and sly stone. he was part of a stage and screen tradition that produced josephine baker  fred astaire  sammy davis jr. and judy garland.  who better expressed so many contradictions  struggles  achievements  questions  ambiguities  transgressions  about race and gender? about our obsession with youth  with the innocence and eros of children; that oh-so-american drive to reinvent and transform our bodies  our lives and our selves?  theres almost no major cultural story michael jackson hasnt starred in for nearly 40 years.  mark anthony neal  a professor of black popular culture at duke university  is the author of several books including new black man.  his essay can you remember? is featured in a recently released michael jackson box set  hello world: the complete motown solo collection. michael jackson and the jackson five were products of the early moments of the post-civil rights era of the 1960s. part of what was so significant about their successes  the hit records  the sold-out concerts  the saturday morning cartoon  the teen fanzine that they helped spawn  was their crossover appeal  which was not unlike that of their record label motown. by the time michael jackson stepped forward on his own with recordings like off the wall (1979)  and thriller (1982)  his generational peers were of an age where they could fully appreciate what it meant for an african-american man to achieve the level of mainstream appeal that jackson did.   lost in his unprecedented celebrity was the multicultural  multiracial and multi-ethnic component of his audience  and few artists before or after could ever claim such a following. at his peak  michael jacksons celebrity  like his music  had transcended simple labels; the king of pop was apropos.  as his career transcended national borders  michael jackson became a coalescing symbol of global community. a decade before the internet  his music and moves formed the lingua franca of that community.  many of those fans (im sure new york congressman peter king was never among them) surely tired of the sideshow that jacksons life and  to a lesser extent  his career had become. the outpouring of emotion that weve witnessed since his death and so visibly on display in los angeles today may have less to do with jacksons musical legacy  singular as it is  as  with the remembrance of the beloved community that he symbolized.  its not surprising to see how such a community is reconstituted via facebook and twitter and other social networking sites.  it suggests that as the demands of our everyday lives push us in so many different and conflicting directions there are still needs for human contact and shared experience.  michael jackson was  perhaps  the most powerful symbol of those needs.  bonnie fuller  the founder and chief executive of bonnie fuller media  is the former editorial director of american media inc. and the former editor in chief of us weekly  glamour  cosmopolitan  marie claire and ym magazines. michael jackson  like princess diana  has proven that the tragic and completely unexpected passing of a superstar familiar to billions can create an emotional unifying experience for millions. and as human beings  we like experiences that have the power to emotionally unite us with each other. in normal everyday life  we mostly stick to pleasantries or business-type discussions when talking to all but our closest friends and family. those conversations dont allow for any special bonding with each other. then along comes an event that is so stupendous  so unexpected  involving a celebrity of enormous fame that we all know and hold shared fond memories of  and it jolts us out of our everyday constraints. it doesnt matter who we talk to  a friend or a stranger in line at starbucks  we can suddenly  without any normal hold-backs  just share our thoughts  about michael jackson. share our shock  our regrets at his passing. the fact that michael jackson sang the songs that were the background music for so many of our growing-up experiences  gives us the basis for this connection. its impossible for almost everyone of certain generations in western-influenced cultures not to feel the enormity of the loss of his talent  or to wonder what might have been if he had been able to make the comeback he hoped for. ultimately  being able to share our collective grief is a cathartic and hugely satisfying experience for us as human beings. yoshiaki sato has taught american literature and popular music at the university of tokyo and elsewhere. his various publications include japanese translation of thomas pynchons vineland and gregory batesons steps to an ecology of mind. when mtv first appeared and music needed a clear visual definition  michael jackson was right there at the frontier. his thriller album defined an entire pop culture  and destroyed forever the idea that music is only for listening. michael  along with the rest of the 80s bunch  made pop music easy and spellbinding to watch. after that  the makers and deliverers of music were able to announce to a global audience  to borrow a phrase from michael  we are the world. indeed. just watch michael on stage in bucharest at the 1992 dangerous world tour. watch the radiant eyes and the bouncing bodies of that enormous crowd and how mesmerized they were by his presence.   michael may have been a bigger force in history than all the unused hydrogen bombs. his moonwalk may have been a bigger leap for mankind than apollo 11. just imagine one billion people on earth having watched one minute of michael every day for 15 years of their lives. altogether that would make some 90 000 000 000 total hours of attention. this is power. and its potentially a huge  efficient  cultural  and political power. comments are no longer being accepted. for me  and i suspect for most people  its the music.  it is absolutely addictive and can move even the most serious people. mj rocks! money  pure and simple.  ad revenues generated by media covering his death and profits generated by the sale of jackson-related merchandise will keep this mania going for as long as possible. michael jackson was bigger than this world in his thinking. i cannot name any other artist that wrote about unification of humanity and love in the way that he did; he was ahead of his time/our time.  globally  while many fans collectively grieve  i am not sure if as a nation  as a world we will ever get to that place that michael jackson sung and spoke aboutwith passion unmatched.   people were hung up on the things that were fodder for conversation in the absence of  or the shying away from that which we collectively negate as juvenile: love and collective humanity. he loved in ways that we had not seen and that were not socially normed  but is celebrity a social norm?  michael jackson transcended barriers in ways that we have never seen.  he morphed himself into someone who did not look black or white  male or female  so to that degree something in him led him to sacrifice himself on multiple levels to leave a legacy on the world.  he was absolutely someone and many people were somehow internally frustrated by his physical changes because he forbade us from assigning him a label  thus much of the media (and many people) resolved to bullying and name calling in the worst way.  the accusations  the bullying broke a mans spirit and regardless of whether he could be assigned a race  a gender  or a sexual preference; he was in fact human. i  like countless others grieve the loss of a spirit that many people (often the relentless media) would rather crucify than embrace  this is why i grieve. he was unprecedented in his talent  his genius  his work ethic  and his philanthropy.  so i speak on behalf of why i grieve and sure there are things to chat about  wonder about  and questions that should  in respect of his privacy  go unanswered to the public  but in terms of spirit and global presence we grieve the loss of goodness much like we grieved others who have gone before (jackie onassis  princess diana) and countless others who left their global fingerprint on the human spirit. michael jackson will be missed. i  mostly agree with john mcwhorter about him ending up looking like greta garbo. the memorial was heartwrenching to watch. it is impossible to explain the response to michael jacksons death in any logical rational way or even by referencing jackson himself. this kind of unrestrained mania can only be explaind as a human hunger being fulfilled. our need for heroes and someone to believe in. confirmation that live is more than our day to day existence. that there is something more. no matter how good a singer and dancer michael jackson was no entertainer really has the kind of impact on society or on individual lives the response to jacksons death would have us believe jackson did. michael jackson in this context is an actor on a stage in death who allows us to suspend reality in favor of becoming one with a fantasy we are watching and doing our part to create to fantasy. a self-fulfilling prophesy enhanced by the media machine. as such we become fulfilled if only momentarily. no one ccnsumed by michael jackson the last few days will find their lives or society any different a week or month from now because of michael jackson. but you can be forgiven for thinking so right now based on what we see today. part of the mania is nostalgia  remembering a happier  simpler time when michael jackson had his earliest successes. there also has not be any musical artist/dancer/entertainer to emerge in the last 25 years who comes anywhere close to being as talented. sadly he couldnt handle the fame he courted and it killed him as surely as anything else did. the weirder he became  the more he reminded me of norma desmond from billy wilders classic  sunset boulevard  right down to the pet monkey. r.i.p. mj. i think we have wronged mjhe music will live on foreverwe will always be the mediocre people who will hate him because he dared to be different!! he has the potic license to do as he pleasesocienty can never bind genius!! it was his voice. michael jackson was a child that sang his heart out arpegiating up and down with precious melodies. i thought then that he was sweetness itself. this boy was love that could be experienced at listening  then he taught himself taking masters for tutors how to dance and so he danced! that grace that was his own never ceased to attract and hold longer that any other man on earthit was as if he could sign forever by me. i actually chose to dine out only at the place where they carried his sound tracks finding in his voice comfort in the midst of my own troubles. he had me rest  ironically! it was more than art  michael was personal  intimate and so very mine. in very many ways although i am nothing like him i feel there was a love relationship with this tiny man that found so much trouble in the world of the grown ups and for that i held him soi am as hurt and as captive of him as the first time i heard his sweet darling voice. i know what i am about say will make a few of you readers angrydoes america realize that we are making a huge deal over a child molester!! i mean we all know he did it  twice and he had more than enough money to get himself out of it. why else would you have a house called neverland  why invite little kids over to your house when you are the only adult no other children around. sure he had great music but that was before all the alligations. taxpayers are paying 3.5 million for this and i think it just crazy. he died whoopie moving on. rip i am a huge michael jackson  and jackson 5  fan. a single observation among many one could make: perhaps great numbers of us  in michael  saw and connected with two different people: first  the artistic and physical genius we admired and wished we could be  and 2) the lonely  sad  and perhaps abused or neglected person we in fact are. we craved what he had  and we believed he understood and cared about some bruised and lost parts of ourselves. he was both a fantastically gifted and thus remote figure  and an ordinary boy/man who wanted to love and be loved. in life and in death  this powerful combination attracts us. i have been thinking a lot of this situation and i dont know what anyone else thinks  but i personally am anger at his death people fight day and night like farrah for their life and just like elvis i dont think michael death was suppose to happen at 50 years old.  the drugs whether prescription or not was something that could of been kept from happening just like elvis death.  they both should of been able to grow old with their children and families.  i think that is what makes this more sad is it just did not have to be this way for both michael and elvis. i dont know what drives michael mania on the whole; i can only offer a personal perspective.  my michael mania is steeped in gratitude for the example of the potential a solitary life can have. the singing  the dancing  the creating  the teacher  the student  the humanitarian and the celebrity are all apendages to that notion.  each is crucial in defining his singular example  but its the entire package that drives the mania  the bad and the good mixed together.  say what you want about him personally  but the man drove many people to do genuine  sincere and drastic goodeven if the worst assumed about him happened  on that count he deserves respect.i am maniacal for those i sincerely respect. i am curious why the black community imbrace him now when he did everything in his power to be white. he even bought white children. i find that insulting and i am white. i still can;t get over the fact that he is on record saying there is nothing wrong with an adult male sleeping with little boys. did everyone forget that? maybe i would mourn him if he had died before all the surgery and sleepovers. ditto to daves comment.  the media mania is only about the media  specifically money and ratings. the media are unfortunately meeting an apparent insatiable public need to broadcast about michael jackson ad nauseum.  sad at many  many levels. its the music  stupid.  the guy is really really good!  americans dont get it! i spent the last two weeks reading everything i could about michael jackson with the purpose of writing a very poignant and factually accurate account of the incredible life he lived.  if youre a fan of the king of pop  or if youre a fan of good writing  check out my story on the worlds most famous entertainer. //balmer.typepad.com/keithsmooth/ a funny writer  a funny blog he ranted against jewish people and pulled the race card when it fit his purpose. the rest of the time he tried to deny being black  good grief he is whiter than i am as being of irish decent. his children (who are not of his dna) are white. he thought it was ok to sleep with little boys. all of that is forgiven now that he killed himself with drugs? not for a lot of us. i do not more the passing of someone like him. he was a very disturbed person. based on the reaction to his death  there are great many more out there. some of us grieve out of guilt  of our slander  lies and jeering   which acted as a guard against the times when we couldnt comprehend how he had embodied humanity  as we had envisioned  and yet we ourselves seem to stumble in the opposite every time. we all had lost an anchor of love and passion in the sea of violence and hedonism that we swim. its not so much about michael jackson was but what his fans are not.  to me  people who scream and cry and faint over a distant man they would never meet indicates a profound emptiness inside themselves. that millions worship emotionally infirm people like princess diana  elvis and michael jackson is proof to me of a sad  sick society. that today  in a state passing out ious and cutting valuable programs for the needy is a multi million dollar memorial service for a wealthy man that molested children is truly sad. i want to comment on an episode in michael jacksons life that needs to be noted for the record  for posterity.  when the cable music station was created and becane popular across the usa  canada and other countries  blatant racism on the part of the companys executives kept black performers off the channel. all protests were ignored  all sorts of transparent excuses were offered with snickers and jocular put downs. for myself  i personally hated these mtv executives  a small handful  with a boiling raging hatred. had i been an american  i would have found some way to act against them.  it was michael jackson himself acting on his own initiative that ended this racist discrimination by mtv  an organization that was becoming almost indespensible (at that time) in the business of popular music. for this   and the music too of course thank you michael.  and if the heaven that you believe in really does exists  may you rest in peace and joyful tranquility. c. alexander brown whats driving the mania?  thats easythe media.  were told he was the king of pop and he became so.  were told that he was electrifying and he became so.  were told he was a perveted weirdo and he became so. he was a good singer and dancer  but there have been (and will be) lots of others.  i dont miss him at all.  hes no more gone now than he has been for the past several years.  his music and videos will be around forever on the internet.  he has done anything notable (in music  that is) for a long time. well have enough controversy and conspiracy about his death for a long time.  the king of pop is dead?  not really. john  one day youll understand it all. its called

sports,advertisement supported by personal journeys twenty years after my first visit to the vietnamese city  would the people i love most love the land i love most? by matt gross almost as soon as we landed in ho chi minh city  vietnam  i set out to make my family miserable. this was not difficult. it was late august  nearing 90 degrees and humid. all i had to do was propose we walk through the streets of the former saigon to a restaurant for lunch. at first  my wife  jean  and our daughters sasha  7  and sandy  almost 4  were game. the road outside our airbnb  an air-conditioned two-bedroom  with tile floors and brick walls  carved into a crusty ocher art deco building in central district 1  was oddly calm. shade trees spindled past skeins of electrical wire  while the low plastic chairs of an open-air cafe sat neatly in the shade of a long  blank wall. when we came to a busy avenue  we all held hands and stepped bravely into traffic  trusting that motorbikes would swerve around us with unthinking grace. (and they did!) soon  though  the sun bore down  and we sweated our way along a market street. the rough pavement was at once dusty and damp  the din of shoppers and small trucks inescapable  the ripe scents of fruits and vegetables  fish and pork  as unrestrained as their vivid hues. all about was action  noise  aroma  drama  the kind of whirling vortex of energy i feed on. not so the ladies. there was whining  dawdling  worry. one child had to be carried. (i bore that burden.) it is entirely possible that someone asked  are we there yet? finally  after 15 endless minutes  we reached a fluorescent-lit restaurant  chi tuyen  where we sat on blue plastic stools at a lightweight metal table and ordered bun thit nuong  nubs of pork grilled to caramelized sweetness  on a tangle of cool rice noodles  shredded lettuce and herbs like mint and perilla. the kids ate and calmed down  and sandy played adorably with one of the kittens roaming the restaurant. outside  rain began to fall  harder and harder  and then even harder. we were trapped  but there was nowhere else in the world i wanted to be. twenty years earlier  almost to the day  i had moved here to live. vietnam and the united states had only recently re-established diplomatic relations  and i was a fresh college grad embarking on an adult life of adventure in an unknown land. over the course of a year  i fell in love with the city everyone still called saigon  with the seething chaos of its streets  the head-spinning variety of its flavors  the boundless outgoing enthusiasm of its people. in a lifetime of constant travel  vietnam was my first  truest  deepest love. and yet  though id been back to visit a dozen times or more since 1997  id never brought my wife and kids  primarily because jeans family lived in taiwan  so that island always took precedence on trips to asia. in the summer of 2016  however  we found ourselves in taipei for an extended period  long enough  i decided  to make a weeklong trip to vietnam. first we would hit ho chi minh city  then spend two days at a beach resort near nha trang  nothing overly ambitious  just enough for my family to begin to understand the place that made me who i am. still  i worried: would the people i love most love the land i love most? how could they not? all around were visceral pleasures. at the entrance to our building sprawled a sidewalk restaurant  and every morning theyd send up breakfast on a tray: bowls of bun bo hue  a spicy beef-and-pork noodle soup  or banh mi op la  fried eggs with baguettes as light as air. from the next-door cafe  i would fetch tall glasses of vietnamese iced coffee  made from house-roasted beans and thick with condensed milk  plus pastries from tous les jours  a korean franchise bakery (not my pick  but the kids adored it). we would eat in our cozy little apartment  and id sigh with contentment: this was just like my old life here  but now i had people to share it with. from there  wed venture out to see friends id long wanted my wife to meet. we visited quynh anh pham  a thin  elegant video producer  known as qa  who had reinvented herself as ho chi minh citys premiere modern florist. her shop and cafe  padma de fleur  lay down a still-unfinished alley; its courtyard was draped with dangling mokara orchids  watering cans painted blue and pastel pink  and weathered metal saucer lamps. the lemonades that qa served my daughters came garnished with pale roses  and there was yet another kitten for sandy to play with. this was classic saigon  an oasis of sophisticated beauty that a casual visitor might never glimpse. places like padma de fleur felt especially precious when i witnessed the big  obvious changes to the citys landscape. like takashimaya  the glittering  multistory japanese mall that had just opened in the heart of saigon  within sight of the opera house (still lovely  at about 120 years old) and bustling ben thanh market.  it was as fancy a mall as vietnam has seen  chock-full of international luxury brands (and a japanese food court!)  and it reminded me that back in 1996  there was but one mall  saigon superbowl  out near the airport  where country bumpkins would come to gape at  and fearfully attempt to ride  the citys sole escalator. now  at takashimaya  escalators intimidated no one  except for one stylish woman wearing wobbly four-inch heels  who held tightly to the railing as she ascended. the mall felt so utterly normal that i didnt freak out when sandy ran off and got lost for 10 minutes  this was no longer the rough-and-tumble city where youd worry about kidnappers. every excursion was an opportunity to compare the vietnam i remembered with the vietnam it now was  mostly to my delight  occasionally with disappointment. a road along the ben nghe canal  for example  had been widened and landscaped into sunny modernity  but the project had wiped out old buildings  including an auto garage that  at night  turned into a secret shellfish restaurant. sasha  however  approved. i like this part of vietnam  she said  gazing out the window of our taxi  because it looks well trained. nice and clean and it looks good  like it works. the other parts  she trailed off  and i knew why: vietnam was not a hit with my family. the heat was rough. (what did they expect during summer in asia?) they were not fans of the dirt  the chaos  the insects. the kids kvetched about being bored. (just like at home!) jean remarked  i dont think southeast asia is for families. i didnt know quite how to take that. for decades  id seen foreign families all over southeast asia  a major reason id wanted to bring my own family here. on the other hand  i understood: like new york  ho chi minh city exists not for tourists but for its own lively populace; this metropolis doesn't care about coddling outsiders  its too busy entertaining itself. so the task of entertaining fell to me. whenever the heat grew too brutal  we would stop for sinh to  cool fruit shakes  orange  mango  banana  soursop  avocado  sold everywhere from the alleys of the backpacker district to market stalls in cholon  the citys chinatown. we took taxis and ubers  not motorbikes. we rummaged the racks of mayhem  a hidden-away vintage clothing store  and emerged with armfuls of finds  including an oversize flutter-sleeve top for sasha and what jean described as a ditsy floral dress for herself. i couldnt get over how far the city had progressed: twenty years ago  used clothes were only for the poor; now you needed a credit card to buy them. another friend  the vietnamese-american artist trong gia nguyen  led us through the downtown gallery scene. at galerie quynh  which opened in 2003  i gushed over one of trongs works  a laser-cut facsimile of a brise-soleil  the sun-shielding patterned screens that you see everywhere in vietnam  cut to the size of a window or an entire buildings facade. at dia projects  jean and i were entranced by fruits  children & the cutting  mai hoangs disturbing  entrancing watercolor renderings of children as fruits  dragonfruit  passionfruit  strawberries  being opened  peeled  dissected. at each stop  sasha sat on the ground and opened her notebook to draw  engrossed and uncomplaining. sandy  meanwhile  was kept entertained by trongs friend athsia  a canadian musician passing through on her way to gigs in australia. im told they discussed frozen. occasionally  my ladies even entertained themselves. while taking an uber through cholon  jean pointed out a trio of early 20th-century shophouses  slightly decrepit but charming still.  is this where the lover was filmed? she asked excitedly  referring to the 1992 movie based on the marguerite duras novel. if she could muster such enthusiasm  maybe my experiment was working? love might be out of the question  but id settle for like. instead  i got ambivalence. for every grand dinner of grilled pork and sour fish soup with old friends  there was a scary cockroach on some sidewalk. the grassy martini at hum  a stylish vegetarian restaurant  was addictive  but we couldnt forget that grim immigration officer whod stamped us into the country. (i dont think hes happy to see us  jean observed.) the kids may have enjoyed making crafts projects at the oddly named somewhereland  madam fatty fatt  a colonial-era villa that had been renovated into a hogwarts-like castle  the kids seemed content to work on crafts projects  like cutting felt into hats and cloaks for wooden witch figurines. (meanwhile  jean and i sipped iced coffees.) but this was too chill for sasha. when youre young  you dont want to sit down and relax  she insisted. you want to move! which is why  on our last day before flying to the beach  i booked a van to the cu chi tunnels  the underground former viet cong base  about 90 minutes outside saigon  that is a major tourist draw. at last  the kids could roam and climb  and gawk at the admirably barbaric traps used to catch enemy soldiers  while i pointed out ponds that were really bomb craters and told them about a war i was born too late to remember firsthand. and  of course  we clambered about in the three-foot-high tunnels  which is any kids dream but drew rivers of sweat even from this smaller-than-average american. when we emerged  sandy (who could stand fully upright in the tunnels) explained: you ate a lot of dinner  thats why you didnt fit in the tunnel. you ate a lot of food  like anna and elsa! sasha was more succinct: this place is pretty amazing! as my heart warmed  i also realized: oh my god  my kids are  tourists. they like it easy. they like fun. theyre on vacation. what did i expect? one day  perhaps  theyd outgrow easy fun  and want to know how vietnam turned dad into dad  but it didnt have to be today. tomorrow wed be at a pristine beach resort  with a swimming pool and a villa twice the size of our brooklyn apartment  easy fun for $500 a day. someday  surely  we would return to ho chi minh city. maybe not next year  but someday. and then we could all compare the vietnam we remembered with the vietnam it would become. for her part  jean had but a single requirement for our return. next time  she said  i want to stay somewhere nicer. advertisement    collapse see my options 
sports,  an internet company with a kooky name  no profits and fresh from a splashy super bowl ad is getting ready to go public. good luck  says thestreet.com. thestreet.coms jonathan berr on tuesday points out that go daddy  a registrar of internet domains  filed for an intial public offering of stock in may. the company has been around for awhile (a still shot from its risque 2005 superbowl commercial is above)  but it hasnt shown an annual profit in the nine years of its existence. it works in a highly competitive environment.  it is  according to thestreet.com  a lot like vonage  the internet-based phone service whose recent i.p.o. sank out of the gate and has since been the target of lawsuits and heaps of derision.  thestreet.coms comparison with vonage  the worst-performing i.p.o. so far this year  is bound to irritate underwriters led bylehman brothers and merrill lynch as they try to drum up interest in go daddys offering. in its preliminary prospectus  the company said it hoped to raise as much as $200 million. go to article from thestreet.com  comments are no longer being accepted. hmm  so godaddy wants to go public eh? first they should explain the nine years of operation without profit. their prices maybe great  i even host my own personal site and email with them  but doing business with and buying shares for capital gain are two different things. these investment banks will do just about anything to fool investors into thinking the offerings are great. you ask how so? well they will drum up excitment  do fabulous pr work  invite all their associates to attend the roadshows  just to help cover the tip of the iceberg. but thanks to vonage  the public is not stupid! you cant just dump your worthless shares on us just to rid of your debt or pay off your originial investors!  yaser //equityinvestmentideas.blogspot.com wow. where to start ?  hosting hundreds or thousands of fake  fraud websites and doing nothing to limit the problem:  as a hosting provider  we cannot be expected to judge the alleged illegal activities you have mentioned. however  we are more than happy to quickly comply with any court-issued order  or official request by law enforcement (whose burden it is to determine the existence of illegal activities). we regularly work with courts and law enforcement from the local to the international level. as a result  we would recommend you seek an injunction from a court as the most efficient way to handle this situation.  its like the bank saying  yes we cashed fake checks on your account  now go complain to somebody that cares. imho this is not a company that has a future. advertisement

sports,advertisement by hanna ingberoct. 23  2013  using twitter sounds so simple. type out no more than 140 characters  the maximum allowed in a single tweet  and hit send. thats all  right? not quite. twitters interface may look simple  but it is not  and its complexity has turned off many people who tried the service. this is a problem because one of the big questions facing twitter before it starts trading as a public company  perhaps as early as next month  is whether it can attract enough users to become a robust outlet for advertising dollars. although twitter brings in money from advertising  it does not yet sell enough ads to make a profit. still  in the few years since it started  twitter has quickly gained users. people and organizations of many stripes  celebrities like justin bieber  brands like oreo  even the economist jeffrey sachs  have flocked to twitter to share information and thoughts. in a prospectus released for investors last week  the company said its worldwide monthly users grew to 232 million in the third quarter  up from closer to 200 million early this year. according to a pew survey  the percentage of american internet users on twitter as of may was 18 percent  more than double the percentage in november 2010. advertisement but those numbers are a far cry from those attained by facebook  a top rival. facebook has more than a billion users  and according to a pew survey  facebook was used by 67 percent of american internet users as of late last year. advertisement will twitter become a platform used by the masses? maybe the best way to answer that question is to use the service yourself. heres a primer. set up an account signing up to twitter is simple. just choose a username  known as a handle  and a password. most people try to use their name or a variation of it as a handle  like @billgates. try to keep it short. you dont want your handle taking up too many of the 140 characters if someone mentions you in a tweet. next  give other twitter users some sense of who you are. people who dont know you but find themselves interested in your twitter feed will want some clues about whether they should follow you  meaning add your twitter messages to the ones that they see in their unique feed. unlike on facebook  where people connect with their friends and family  on twitter most people follow others with similar interests or professions. start by adding a profile picture to your account. a headshot  cartoon  image of your puppy  anything is better than the default egg  which screams twitter newbie. and fill out your bio. use the 160 characters available for your bio to explain who you are and try to give a sense of what topics you will tweet about. you can also include a link to a web site  maybe of the company you work for or a personal site. heres an example of a strong bio from laura seay  a political scientist: proud texan. colby college political scientist. i study governance by non-state actors & u.s. policy in central africa. scenic maine  texasinafrica.blogspot.com. build a community next  find people to follow. the twitter messages written by accounts you follow will show up in your feed  also called your timeline. its easy to get deluged with tweets  so be selective about which accounts you follow. you want your timeline to feel alive with smart  interesting  informative and entertaining tweets. but remember that unfollowing an account is only a click away  too.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. decide what topics youre most interested in  like college football or canadian politics or new york restaurants  and then search by name for writers or commentators on those topics. you can also search by topic or geographic area on https://twitter.com/search-advanced. once you find an account that tweets regularly on a topic youre passionate about  see what that account follows. for example  if youre a fan of jessica valenti (@jessicavalenti)  a feminist author and speaker  you can follow her and then discover others interested in gender issues by looking at her feed. to see everyone a person is following  click on the persons name and then click following. advertisement once youve found people to follow  engage them. send them a link to an interesting article. (to save character space when sending a link  use a web address shortening service like bit.ly.) interact with them: respond to their tweets by hitting reply  mention the articles they share  show that you like a tweet by hitting the favorite button. when all else fails  try a compliment. learn the language to engage with people  it helps to know some of twitters insider language and etiquette  which is a big part of what can make the service confusing for new users. rt means retweet; it is used when repeating what someone else said. if you want to add commentary  place it before the rt. heres an example of cory booker  the senator-elect from new jersey  retweeting and adding commentary to the twitter user @lindscarter on election day last week:              i did. and thank you! rt @lindscarter: i voted for cory booker! did you vote today?         twitter pros often amend their tweets with via or h/t  which stands for hat tip. these are ways to give credit to someone who shared the information first. acknowledge others in the twitter community  and the favor will most likely be returned. understand the symbols twitter users often add hashtags  like #brooklyn or #superbowl  to enable others searching for that topic to find their tweet. they work well in specific instances  during events like professional conferences  for example  when you want to know what others are saying about a panel. but hashtags  while a nice idea  often feel so #2012. theyve been overused and arent terribly useful for searching. hashtag fans will disagree  but my advice: use them sparingly. an important technical rule governs the use of the @ sign  which is the beginning of every accounts handle. if you start a tweet to someone with @  only that person and those who follow both of you will see the tweet. this is so you can have a semi-private conversation with that person without cluttering up others timelines. to make the tweet appear in the timelines of everyone who follows you  add a word or character before the @ sign  even just a period. heres an example from dan nowicki  a reporter at the arizona republic:              .@senjohnmccain tells critics that immigrants fill jobs americans won't do. "the immigrant has always grabbed the bottom rung " mccain says.         but tweet like a person a lot of people join twitter and think they are supposed to suddenly start writing in short bursts of words barely strung together. who needs pronouns or subject-verb agreement? this is twitter! twitter is still a conversation  and you will want to be understood. write the way you speak. let your tweets flow like sentences. and let your character come out. organize your feed one of the best ways to organize the madness that can become twitter is by using the platforms lists tool. create different lists based on your interests and then add people to them. at 9 a.m.  when you want the news  you can pull up your media list and see what your favorite news services and journalists are tweeting. at 5 p.m. on a friday  pull up your entertainment list to get weekend plans. tell others and finally  the best way to build your community is by telling people that youre on twitter. add your handle to your business card  your e-mail signature and  when possible  the bottom of your correspondence  like so: follow me on twitter @hannaingber. because of an editing error  the toolkit column on thursday  about the fundamentals of using twitter  misstated the number of characters allowed for a twitter bio. it is 160 characters  not 140  which is the limit for a tweet. a version of this article appears in print on october 24  2013  on page b1 of the new york edition with the headline: twitter illiterate? mastering the @bcs.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
sports,advertisement  current events conversation  by                      the learning network  jan. 25  2018  every week your contributions to our site seem to get more thoughtful  and every week were delighted to see loyal schools (shout-out to wilmington  n.c.!) show up  as well as welcome new ones. this week  for instance  we have student comments from momence  ill.  and perry  fla. but we also want to spotlight the contributions of one person in particular: meghan miraglia from massachusetts  we love what you have to say  and we appreciate the interesting ways you say it. we seem to call ms. miraglia out every week  but this week she also starts us off  below  with a thoughtful post about americas tangled relationship with race. finally  though our weekly film club feature is not one of our writing prompts  and thus not part of what we capture in this feature  we want to note that the jan. 12 edition  on the short film can texting save lives   was popular with student commenters. we heard from apopka  fla.; houston  tex.; and jefferson high school in lafayette  la. teachers  if your students regularly post to our writing prompts and are sometimes called out here  wed love to hear what the experience has been like  for them and for you. this is a new feature this year  and were always seeking feedback. in fact  the email address to which you can write and tell us is lnfeedback@nytimes.com. thank you in advance! advertisement please note: all student comments have been lightly edited for length  but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted. advertisement _________ our most popular prompt last week was is america backsliding on race? students told us what they thought of the state of race relations  and if the presidency of donald trump has affected them one way or another. meghan miraglia from massachusetts thinks america always had a dark side: i dont think that america is slipping into an earlier  uglier version of itself - i think that america has always had a dark underbelly. beneath apple pie  baseball  and the glitz and glamour of the american dream  there has always been a side that most americans have the decency to be ashamed of. america was built on slavery and racism  but the credit was taken by europeans.in school  we are learning about the eloquence of previous presidents. we read speeches by lincoln and marvel at how he was able to say things in such a precise and careful way. in present-day america  we read tweets by our child-president and marvel and how he is able to command anxiety with just 180 characters.racism has been ingrained into american society. beyonces quote sums it up best. in a speech she gave when presenting colin kaepernick with the muhammed ali legacy award  she said  ...racism is so american  that when we protest racism  some assume we are protesting america. she is right. americas dark underbelly should be shamed  it should be the thing that we feel disgust towards  the thing that we apologize for and work to end. it should not be the thing that is passed down to our children. i see the uprisings of racism in high school  unfortunately - its not my classmates fault that some of them feign ignorance at what he says and does. it is americas fault  it is society  it is generations and generations who failed us. ava lanning of danvers  mass.  believes that individual actions matter most: is america backsliding on race? no. are individuals backsliding on race? now that is a different story. i think as a whole  america has improved upon the way different races view one another and it confuses me as to why people think the america we live in today is slightly comparable to the earlier  uglier version. i agree with sterling tuckers statement on how there is not a lot of honesty in the country because of how everything has to be filtered. everything needs to be politically correct. some individuals have a hard time facing the truth. who we are and where we are as a country is impossible to evaluate. do i feel as if america is slipping into the earlier and uglier self? no  i do not. i think society is deliberately portraying races either as a target or privileged. all over social media whether the person is young or old  white or black  they have something political to say. racism is a two way street. one race should not be at fault for being more racist than the other because wouldnt that be considered racist too? ever since donald trump has been elected  racism and political correctness have been the talk of the day. in my opinion  i think racism is on the rise  and there is nothing to do about it because of the way people have grown up and individually faced racism. amiya nelson from illinois thinks racism is on the rise: i feel as if racism is on the rise weve had plenty of killings in the united states on the account of another race not liking african americans and its not fair. being a young african american lady i have experienced a lot of racism as ive gotten older from classmates to teachers to even cops an outsiders as well. i get on social media and run across racism. but its going to continue to be on the rise because americans let this be acceptable. payton james from massachusetts wrote about hidden racism: do i believe that america is slipping into an earlier  uglier version of itself? no. america has always been ugly  its just covered up. america has a foundation of prejudice  and many minorities suffer from this today. the fact that black children need to be taught to deal with the police before they learn how to read is ugly. since the election of trump  more people are following in our presidents footsteps in regards to voicing their opinions on ethnic minorities. i have certainly heard racial slurs in person  but where i see the most insensitive comments is on social media. i see people responding to trumps barbaric tweets about immigrants  people say that only real americans should be here. my response to that is that any of us who are black  white  or asian are not real americans  we trace back to elsewhere. the only true americans race was nearly decimated. in fact  the people who are often told to go back to their country are mexicans and people from central and south america. what many dont understand is that people from these regions often have a fair amount native american ancestry.therefore  this is their country. theyre the real americans. in kop pa feels racism is unfair: i believe that america is turning back into an uglier version of itself because it is the thought and idea that sticks to everyone. this idea and thought is thought one race is to be held lower than another on a scale. this is not fair because everyone is born equal  and to judge someone by their race and belief is disgusting. donald trump has made this idea stick with everyone and believe that this is the way to make america great again and to get rid of the people that dont belong. the people that dont belong want a better life; in a better country; with better opportunities and the many people are in the way of making things right for them and their families. in this country and world everyone should belong no matter the race or belief. _________ two comments for the prompt does every country need a loneliness minister? caught our eye this week. cindy from california suggested we look around our own neighborhood: what london is doing is a great need of society today. neighbors dont talk to each and people just dont care about each.yeah we sure rescue whales and do something for all kinds of causes but do we know if our neighbor is sick ? how many people here in the last year or so have 1. picked up medicines for a sick person 2. consoled a grieving soul. 3. sat with an elderly person 4. sat with a friend and lent them an ear. we talk about all the big issues in the world but dont we know what issues our next door neighbor is dealing with. and bradly boaz from wilmington thinks small actions can go a long way toward alleviating loneliness: anxiety  cardiovascular disease  dementia  and even depression are all horrible illnesses that are recently proven to be derived from this common and quite frankly subtle disease known as loneliness. we all face it  whether it be the cause of losing a loved one or even just being away from those we love for a short period of time  loneliness never seems to go away. young or old  friendly or shy  confident or afraid we are all exposed to this dangerous  illness creator  so why not arm ourselves against? in the u.k  they have decided to make a stand against the overwhelming statistics involving loneliness  and how more than 200 000 britain face this feeling that is proven worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day! the fight against this battle starts in the u.k with a minister for loneliness  but in the u.s  no action has been made. we have almost 5x as many residents as the u.k  and i will remind you that is more than 1 million recorded citizens facing extreme loneliness  and still no action. we arm ourselves against any other disease like the flu and different types of cancer  so why not try and fight loneliness. just a group of people who care and want to make things right about the fact that so many people face the problem of feeling like they are alone in a massive lost world would make things right. just one group  one difference maker. _________ our student opinion question are lavish amenities on college campuses useful or frivolous? raised many good points on student debt  stress and college amenities. xxjayden smith fanxx from wilmington is adamantly against lavish amenities because they will increase student debt: i dont plan on going to college so i can lounge around and sit in a lazy river  especially one that my friends and i paid 85 million dollars for. according to the article  tuition fees have gone up by 60 percent in the last five years. now if thats true; then i want to know whose genius idea it was to steal even more of the students money  but this time  for completely useless renovation projects. how could anyone in good faith  knowing make students pay for this stuff when they are probably already knee deep in debt. i truly hate seeing articles like this; because the only thing they really tell me is that im just going to be in debt for even longer after i get out of college. anna walker from chicago said education should be the focus of college: i completely agree with the author of this article. student debt is a huge problem in the us  and using money from student fees to pay for lavish amenities only drives up costs. college is meant to be a means of education and a place for students to learn about topics they are interested in  and students should be choosing schools based on whether or not that school has a program they are interested in  and not whether or not it has the nicest amenities. colleges marketing themselves through having lazy rivers and climbing walls instead of academics arent helping. while it is true that students need to relax  having expensive amenities wont make or break thattheres plenty to do on campuses already sydney from north carolina thinks college would be more enjoyable: after perusing the article about the top 25 in the nation  i believe that my answer is yes and no to this question. there are many things that you have to take into consideration while looking at a college to attend. in the beginning of this article  amenities provided by colleges seemed to be given a negative connotation. as i looked through the attached top 25 article  my opinion changed. some extra amenities provided by colleges are of no importance  such as a lazy river or bowling alley. on the other hand  if you look at new classrooms and buildings and arts centers that are the center of attention of the campus  then these amenities will offer students a much more enjoyable experience when attending college. having a brand new lab for a certain study in the field of science  or a new auditorium would give students in those areas an opportunity to embrace their true potential at college  where you get to study what you want and find your true self. going to a college with amazing classrooms  labs  and arts facilities will make their experiences unforgettable and allow them to study what they want in the best provisions out there. awd dc replied to sydney from north carolina  quoted above  and said: watch out  it sounds like youre falling into the same trap that the author warns about. when you use language like find your true self and unforgettable experiences  youre falling for the marketing ploys that college admissions offices use to lure students into paying high tuition and taking on illogical amounts of debt. if you take both your coursework and your education seriously  your college experience will likely be unforgettable no matter what. college can be a wonderful time full of personal growth and exploration  but dont idealize it too much. college will hopefully give you the chance to define and pursue your interests more deeply  and you may begin to develop some sense of what it is in life that you value  and therefore what kind of life you might begin to pursue. but finding your true self is not something you should expect higher ed to deliver.youre right to distinguish between lazy rivers and new  upgraded laboratories. if you want to study sciences  that upgraded laboratory could provide valuable intellectual and professional opportunities  and if you want to study art  a new art gallery on campus may provide value. if your dream is to study history  though  youre much better off valuing low student/professor ratios and expansive library access  though  not a fancy new humanities building. be very discerning about what resources you actually need  and be realistic about what resources youre likely to take advantage of. sydney durner wilmington  n.c.  thinks lavish amenities are unnecessary: there is no need for colleges to build lazy rivers for students. they may be nice to use  but college is already so expensive and lazy rivers should be the last thing students should have to pay for. at l.s.u.  the $85 million lazy river was completely financed by student fees. this is not something they should have to use fees for when theyre already on a tight budget. textbooks  tuition  and food costs add up.adding these lavish amenities does increase popularity of these institutions  but that shouldnt be their number one priority. they should be more focused on how affordable college is and their success rate. a student should chose to go to a college because they offer a pool  they should go there because the school offers amazing classes  fits what they want to major in  and because they provide all the resources they need to be successful. clinton davidson from vallejo  calif.  answered succinctly: lavish amenities attract students. but they also harden people against forgiving student loans. maggie yang of king of prussia likes the stress-relieving aspect of some lavish amenities: i think that these lavish amenities could be very useful if used properly. college students work very hard to keep up with all of their classes and curriculum  and all of this can lead to extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. these amenities can be used to relieve stress and relax. studies have found that making some relaxing time for yourself can actually increase the chances of you becoming successful. but spring chicken from georgia  u.s.a.  offered alternative  less expensive stress-relieving activities: water parks are nice  but students  parents  alumni  andyes  members of the schools oversight boardshould have better sense than to have their school provide those kinds of perks. students  why not take a stress-relieving bicycle ride to the beach  or a weekend camping trip up in the mountains? campus leaders  why not allow local businesses that provide (safe) recreational facilities free on-campus advertising of some off-campus activities? (outsourcing these fun amenities also reduces the schools liability should a student get hurtadmins  are you listening?) if i were a college student today  then the last thing id want to do to relax is hang out on the same campus thats causing me stress! _________ our picture prompt family cooking brought in descriptions of familiar and unfamiliar cooking traditions. abby tank wilmington  n.c.  loves the old and the new traditions: my family has many cooking traditions  some new and some old. spaghetti with homemade meat sauce  my mothers homemade green chili  and my fathers famous dry-rub chicken are among the greats in my familys diverse food catalog. no matter what happens earlier that day  i can always count on my parents to make a delicious  home-cooked dinner. new recipes and ideas for food are constantly being experimented with. just the other night  my mom made an absolutely amazing soup with black-eyed peas  chicken  rice  mushrooms  and spices in it. i am very open to trying new foods. this is partly because of the rule my parents established for dinner when my siblings and i were younger: two bites of everything. no exceptions. full  complete bites. this rule has broadened my taste pallet and has allowed me to appreciate all types of food whether its escargot  alligator  calamari  sushi  or just a simple steak. rex hardy from wilmington  n.c.  cherishes family food traditions: my family and i dont really know our ancestry in terms of cultural related traditions  but we have made some of our own that im sure will be passed down. these traditions are usually held on the holidays. on superbowl sunday  if thats considered a holiday  my sister and i have a dessert cook-off. we dont really pick who wins or losses(even though im the obvious winner)  instead  we enjoy what we prepared as we watch the game. another tradition we have falls on christmas. it is called the kong fu panda pizza. i believe it got its name after my mom told us we could be like the kong fu panda after eating it. it is rolled out croissant bread with eggs  cheese  and bacon bits on top. a couple days later  new years eve is being celebrated in our house and we all take pleasure in having our own  homemade coke floats.lastly  theres a tradition that has died out that i wish we would decide to continue. it would happen on sunday after church. my family and my cousins family would all go to my grandmas for a big  home-cooked lunch. we would have green beans  peas  fried chicken  barbeque  slaw  biscuits  and potatoes; finished off with a nice  cold glass of sweet tea. later we would have some sort of pound cake with ice cream.i thoroughly enjoy the food-related traditions we have  but i wish we had more. i love food and its something that everybody can relate to. it also brings people together. jacqueline rose behringer from wilmington  n.c.  said her family specializes in german food: my family and i have many various cooking traditions - almost all cultural related. for example - for all holidays  we cook a variety of german food - kebassi  spaetzel  etc. we also make slovakian food  such as a really good recipe for bondukis. when i personally participate in helping my parents/family make these things in the kitchen  it makes me feel like im really in touch with my origin/culture/heritage more. i can celebrate my german and slovakian culture  and learn more about it  while i help cook. my parents usually tell me stories about our culture while we bake  so  it helps me to feel more informed. in kop pa connects family food traditions with happiness: in the summertime my dad usually grills a steak on a small fire-pit in backyard or on the barbeque grill. we top the steak off with potatoes and a some kind of salad. in the winter time my family eats ukrainian perogies and soup. these are an everyday meal. my favorite time is summertime because i get to spend time with my family outdoors. participating in the food rituals makes me feel happy and stress free spending time with the people i love eating what i love. katie gibbons from buffalo  n.y.  credits family food choices with making her more open-minded: my parents were both raised in lower middle class households with northern european lineages; essentially  meat and potatoes were their way of life and seasoning was a four-letter-word. they were the only ones in their families to reject this way of eating as they grew up  turning to more exotic fare. they raised me with the same appreciation for spice and variety. my mom loves to reminisce about the time that i asked for quinoa instead of chicken nuggets at a family party; the confused stares of the adults proved to my mom that she had done her job. i grew up to enjoy everything from paneer makhani to squid ink pasta. my parents refusal to conform to the food standards of their families ultimately made me a more open-minded individual  ready to try almost anything you put in front of me! _________ our picture prompt "statue of liberty " asked what the statue says about america today. most commenters connected the image to president trump and his policies. jessica lee from wilmington  n.c.  says immigrants are assets to our communities and our nation: i think this political cartoon relates to president trumps recent comments about certain countries. many of you may know the inappropriate things our president said  in spite of our countrys reputation of acceptance of many cultures  whether they are wealthy or not. the statue of liberty now reads: give me your norwegians. people should be able to come from anywhere  by choice. the statue of liberty casts a shadow on the flag  symbolizing our justice and laws previously instated being outshone by president trumps actions and executive orders that he is using to avoid the legislative process. president trump is using his authority to push out people who are not his norm. he says it is because of terrorism  or because they are not wealthy countries  but in reality it is just people who are not like him. president trump is shutting out the rest of the world  isolating our country. multiple countries such as mexico  venezuela  chad  and predominantly muslim countries will not be able to send immigrants to our country by the time trumps presidency is over. this will have detrimental effects on our country and our economy as a whole. immigrants do not steal our jobs  they only take the jobs that rich white men would never want. immigrants are assets to our community and bring diversity to our free nation. tara samtmann from wilmington  n.c.  isnt hopeful on reaching a consensus: the cartoonist is using the comment on the statue of liberty to send the message that president trumps recent comments and his policy on immigration does not support the foundations on which this country was built. the cartoonist is implying that america only wants to have white  law abiding immigrants come to our country. this is the complete opposite position the us had in late 1800s/early 1900s when immigrants from all over the world were coming to the us for a better and brighter future. but the other implied message is that the us has a big immigration problem  which needs to be handled very carefully. unfortunately  i do not think that the us will ever be able to have an immigration policy which everyone will be able support. i also feel that president trump should really think before he speaks or tweets  because it is very easy for his comments to be misinterpreted or not be taken seriously. skaina pierre from danvers  mass.  quoted emma lazarus: the original inscription on the statue of liberty is well know for the phrase  give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. send these  the homeless  tempest-tost to me  i lift my lamp beside the golden door!. donald trump s most recent statement on immigration and his concerns go against the very basis of what america is supposed to represent. this political cartoon in is entirety visually illustrates how demeaning it is to make generalizations towards a certain group of people. the statue of liberty is supposed to symbolize freedom and hope for those who are in countries where the basic human right is unattainable. _________ commenters unanimously answered in the affirmative for our student opinion question do companies have a responsibility to contribute positively to society?  leah schwagerl from wilmington  n.c.  said c.e.o.s should work in unison with other employees: i feel that blackrocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. a third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness  however  the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees  consumers  executives  and ceos should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. companies can have a social purpose. for example  cvs took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014  last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019  and just recently they stated that they will stop significant touch-ups of images. josh failla of wilmington  n.c.  thinks about the topic often: every weekend when my mom goes to shop at whole foods  i think about all the good that they have done in the community. they created the local producer loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. they promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the earth. they also fight poverty all over the world  and i want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world. the move that mr. fink is making is one that is very needed. if major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive  then someone with enough power like blackrock need to force them to do so. as a major investor  if you want something down about a business  then you should be able to change how a business is run. if the executives dont agree with you  then you can just stop investing in the operations. with all the profits that these businesses are making  then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. this movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone. meghan miraglia from massachusetts said business needs to evolve: the world  and its consumer market  is changing rapidly. america  i think  was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist  squash and peas dribbling down its bib  screaming for more  more. now  i think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated  or are attempting to deviate  from the give me this  give me that norm and asking companies and businesses the big questions. where does this product come from?  is this brand cruelty-free?  does this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?  and how does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale? are just a few questions i have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed. even if a company isnt directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services  etc)  it makes sense to give back and get more involved. people like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society  at the very least  they are giving money to a company or business that does. however  as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take  to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back  it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us. hee yun chung from california cited companies that have made a difference: i think in the past  companies didnt really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. in the modern economic landscape  it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. after the 2008 great recession  people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. as a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy  income inequality worsened. companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. to give credit where credit is due  many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities. one example would be aetna  the healthcare company. the ceo of aetna  mark bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. he took action by increasing the companys wage to $16  help pay college debts  and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create a new capitalism by taking the time to understand their workers. companies dont have a lot to lose in the current economic climate. when 18% of the american people believe that corporations are good  a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners  workers  and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years. bella cankurtaran from wilmington  n.c.  has made personal changes in shopping choices: when it comes to shopping i am very picky on who i choose to buy from. why would i want i want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? when companies give back to the community  i know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. plus  its a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase. for example  i used to love steve madden shoes until i realized they had no our story page on their website for what charities they donated to. it infuriated me that the company of the shoes i wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving  homeless  and shoeless people around the globe. here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. thats why i switched to toms brand. not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it  but the company also provides eye treatment  water  safe birth  and bullying response programs. i feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who arent as fortunate as me. anna cross from wilmington  n.c.  quoted an american economist:  milton friedman said what does it mean to say that business has responsibilities? only people can have responsibilities  but as a business is created solely for and by people  this statement seems a bit contradictory. businesses have everything to do with people. people create businesses  work for businesses  purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. as the influence and reputation of a business grows  their responsibilities grow as well  for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. unfortunately in my city  one business decided their influence should be negative. it was recently made public where i live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years  most notably a substance called gen x  which potentially causes cancer. for some reason  this doesnt feel right to me. a business  as it is made by humans  should have responsibilities to other humans  if not in the advancement of society  than the preservation of it. for a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. we need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society  rather than be a detriment to it. francesca altunyay from wilmington  n.c.  wants companies to be held accountable: the extent to which corporate greed goes in america has shown itself for decades. from oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral  it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that make short term sense but eventually threaten their long term viability  as said by jana in the article. whether they like it or not  businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves  interact with  and produce things for society. businesses are not just huge faceless  unidentifiable  artificial entities - they are created by people  run by people  and comprised of working people. they should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. blackrocks action to push exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move  and now says to the public  we know that were actively affecting the earth in a negative way!  which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. i think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; ive boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor  or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. my life is better for it. logan bolduc from wilmington  n.c.  wrote about the key role that shoppers play: i think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. all in all  the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open  does the customer want good or do they want cheap? _________ our picture prompt "phone warnings" asked if phones should carry addition warnings. comments ran the gamut from a strong no to an emphatic yes. gabriel sachs from israel wrote about the profound impact our phones now have on us: what do you do when theres nothing to do? you take out your phone. what do you do when theres something to do? you take out your phone. replace phone with cigarette  and were back in the 50s. unlike cigarettes  though  phones dont have addiction warnings. like cigarettes  they should. in german  theres one word for both addiction and dependence. when were addicted to something  its synonymous to being dependent on it. instead of asking yourself if youre addicted  ask the following: do i take out my phone when im in public transportation to compensate for my inability to remedy my loneliness by talking to another human being? if the answer is yes  youre dependent  ergo  addicted. do i take out my phone the moment i feel a small pinch of boredom rushing into the air? yes? addicted. dependent. obsessed. possessed. you name it. a recent study  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170623133039.htm  found that taking a test in mere proximity of a phone negatively affects results. if your dependent at any degree  the simple fact that youre physically close to your phone disrupts your performance in whatever task at hand. now  think how many people drive with their phones on their dashboard. forget texting while driving  try phoning while driving. even if you blatantly oppose everything ive written until now  i think we can agree a week without your phone would be pretty hard. if you were smoking  youd go to rehab. phones need addiction labels. maggie yang of king of prussia thinks the individual bears responsibility: phone companies should not be forced to make addiction warnings for their phones. it is completely up to the individual to maintain self-control. i think of it as like eating junk food. you need to stay in control of yourself and avoid eating too much unhealthy foods. fast food companies dont go out of their way to say that their foods can lead to heart disease  diabetes  lung disease  etc. it is up to us to make that choice for ourselves. kaley nesselroade from wilmington  n.c.  agrees: i think phones should not come with addiction warnings. tech companies should not be held responsible for their users becoming addicted to their product. it is completely up to individuals to use their phones responsibly. i feel like even if phones were to add addiction warnings  the overall outcome wouldnt change. yes  there are some things that could be done to help phone users become more aware of their usage  like phones giving a report on how you spent your time  but in the end it just doesnt seem necessary. people know how much they are using their phones and seeing a warning for how much it is will not change their usage. it is up to the individual to tell if the amount of time spent on their phone is healthy or not. ishan patel of wilmington  n.c.  came up with this creative solution: it is not their fault that people get addicted to their created device  the tech companies goal is just to create a new innovative device that the users find to suit their needs. people use their phone in a different way their no universal balance how we use our phone everybody has a different balance  people use their phone focusing on few things or using almost all the features. now if the user overuses the device and becomes addicted to it then that would be on the user not on the company. the most i would expect from tech companies would be an in build software that has cooldown time when you use social media software and games for a long time so that way you can still use your phone for work but not for going on social media and playing games and to be honest this argument is not even worth discussing because its like buying netflix and telling them to lower the number of movies and shows available so people dont get addicted to it and slack off on their work. mitchell boehling from wilmington  n.c.   thinks apple should do all it can to decrease phone addiction: with the addition of smartphones  smart speakers(alexa and google home)  and with increasing amount of advertisements it seems that we never are just by ourselves anymore  were always connected. the threat of manipulation that technology poses is incredible because the way it is all connected can be quite addictive for some. if apple has the ability to decrease this dangerous amount of addiction especially when concerning children then i believe that they should do so in anyway that they can. because technology will only continue to grow more and more addictive. _________ were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

movies,advertisement by a.o. scottapril 24  2018  considered on its own  as a single  nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie  avengers: infinity war makes very little sense  apart from the near convergence of its title and its running time. early on  someone menacingly (and presciently) says  you may think this is suffering. no: its salvation. thats a bit overstated either way. its puzzlement and irritation and also  yes  delight. but of course this film  the 19th installment in a series  was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation. in that respect it shouldnt really be thought of as a movie at all  at least in the ways people with jobs like mine are accustomed to using the word. which poses a few difficulties  for me and also  i would argue  for you. directed by joe and anthony russo  scrappy fraternal climbers up the 21st-century hollywood ladder  infinity war is a chunk of matter in the marvel cinematic universe  a vast entity that long ago expanded beyond the usual boundaries of sequelization and brand extension. this synergistic expression of the corporate interests of marvel studios and the walt disney company  which now include 19 feature films and much else besides  has come to be less a creative or commercial undertaking than an immutable fact of life  like sex or the weather or capitalism itself. a preview of the film. that makes the franchise hard to criticize. you cant really be for or against marvel (in spite of the conspiracy theories of some dc fans)  and you cant quite opt out of it either. they dont call it a universe for nothing: where else are we going to go? so we make our zigzagging ways  picking out our favorite planets and solar systems  accepting a baseline of tedious  standardized dead space that makes the brighter constellations seem disproportionately fresh and surprising. guardians of the galaxy was so funny and weird. not like a superhero movie at all. same with thor: ragnarok. captain america is such a complicated guy. black panther gave audiences so much to root for and talk about. [ read a.o. scotts spoiler-filled article about the ending of avengers: infinity war. ] those interesting  unusual specimens  what we used to think of  in simpler times  as good movies  arent exactly accidents. they are carefully planned exceptions that uphold a rule (meaning a regime as well as a norm) of passive acceptance disguised as enthusiasm. this universe is engineered for variety and inclusiveness  within certain strict parameters. above all  the disney-marvel combination is a giant machine that manufactures maximum consent. the cosmos is theirs. the rest of us just live in it. advertisement im not complaining  but rather pointing out how pointless  how silly it sounds when anyone bothers to venture a complaint. who wants to be a hater? still  its worth noting that the ascendance of marvel (and of other  not quite as universal entities like it) has narrowed the parameters of criticism. im supposed to tell you  in this review  how much fun youll have at infinity war. (yes  you will have some. will you have enough? almost.) but ive probably already gone too far in trying to think about what it means. the marvel movies and others of their kind often produce an illusion of profundity  a slick  murky overlay of allegorical suggestiveness. this provides grist for the kind of think pieces that spar with one another  infinity war is liberal; no  its conservative; but dont you see that its a protest against trump; actually  its an attack on the tyranny of political correctness  until they catalyze the inevitable anti-intellectual backlash. its just a movie! dont spoil the fun! get the most out of your screen time with movie and tv recommendations  news and commentary from new york times experts. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. and of course it is with respect to spoilers that the policing of discourse is most ruthlessly and effectively practiced. reviewers who attend advance screenings take a vow of silence about plot details that will be widely known within a week and all but forgotten a week after that. government secrets are guarded with less care  and requests from public officials to go off the record are addressed with more skepticism. but if i mention which superhero dies  or which one has an unexpected relationship with someone else  well  i wouldnt dream of it. not because im afraid of disney executives. its the wrath of their obedient  weaponized minions i fear. in other words: you. advertisement this is not a healthy situation. the reasonable concern that major plot elements not be divulged has spawned a phobic  hypersensitive taboo against public discussion of anything that happens onscreen. if  for example  i were to share that thor (chris hemsworth) mistakes rocket (bradley cooper)  who is a raccoon  for a rabbit  whoops  you already hit send  didnt you? the joke is repeated a half-dozen times  so it kind of ruins itself. and until the end  the whole thing is weirdly free of any but the most superficial  mechanical surprises. the action is especially tedious and predictable. i mean both the scenes of fighting and flying and the overall rhythm of the first two hours or so. people talk for a while  sprinkling jokes and morsels of personality into the heavy dough of exposition. then they fight in the usual way  by throwing giant objects (and one another) and shooting waves of color from their hands. the noisy  bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie  but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination. there is so much to explain  but basically a large purple fellow named thanos (josh brolin) wants  on vague malthusian principles  to wipe out half the life in the universe. as you try to keep track of all the good guys massed against him  you may decide he has a point. but hes not a bad villain. i mean  hes very bad  but his malevolence is laced with melancholy  and there is a ghastly grandeur to his ambition. to fulfill his evil plans  thanos needs to collect six infinity stones  which in spite of their awesome power look a lot like what you would find in the craft kit you have been meaning to regift since your kids seventh birthday. also  come on: another quest for magic gewgaws? this one lumbers from vormir to knowhere to titan  with terrestrial stops in new york  scotland and wakanda. along the way  tony stark (robert downey jr.) and doctor strange (benedict cumberbatch) stage a sherlock holmes meta-duel and compare goatees. the hunky-chris showdown  hemsworth vs. pratt (peter quill) vs. evans (captain america)  ends in a three-way tie. zoe saldana is heartbreaking as gamora. if you end up wanting more black panther (chadwick boseman) or black widow (scarlett johansson) or war machine (don cheadle)  or whoever your favorite happens to be  well  thats kind of the idea  isnt it? but where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. the final act  including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond  as it were) brings a chill  a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. infinity war is the first half of the final installment in the series  and it concludes with a premonition of finality. its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual  unmarvelous world. but those emotions can also be folded back into the movies themselves. this universe is coming to an end. and then where will we be?

movies,advertisement by dionne searceyjuly 17  2016  ugborodo  nigeria  militants are roaming oil-soaked creeks in the south  blowing up pipelines and decimating the nations oil production. islamist extremists have killed thousands in the north. deadly land battles are shaking the nations center. and a decades-old separatist movement at the heart of a devastating civil war is brewing again. on their own  any one of these would be a national emergency. but here in nigeria  they are all happening at the same time  tearing at the country from almost every angle. nigeria is the only country we have  president muhammadu buhari implored in a recent speech. we have to stay here and salvage it together. mr. buhari took office a year ago  promising to stamp out terrorism in the north and to rebuild the nations economy. but he has been knocked off course by a series of crises across the country  forcing him to toggle between emergencies. advertisement beyond low prices for the nations oil  the source of more than 70 percent of the governments revenue  nigerian officials have been tormented by a new band of militants claiming to be on a quest to free the oil-producing south from oppression. they call themselves the niger delta avengers. advertisement despite their name  which sounds as if it might be out of a comic book  the militants have roamed the waters of the south for six months  blowing up crude oil and gas pipelines and shattering years of relative peace in the region. as a result  nigerias oil production in the second quarter this year dropped 25 percent from the same period a year earlier  enough to contribute to a slight increase in global oil prices  according to an analysis by facts global energy  a consulting firm in london. 100 miles lagos niger river benin city nigeria ugborodo bight of benin warri cameroon niger river delta port harcourt nigeria abuja bight of bonny equatorial guinea gulf of guinea detail benin city ugborodo niger river nigeria warri niger river delta port harcourt bight of bonny nigeria abuja gulf of guinea 100 miles detail july 17  2016  partly because of the avengers and their sabotage  nigeria has fallen behind angola as africas top oil producer. the attacks have been so costly that mr. buhari sent troops that had been fighting in the north against boko haram  the extremist group that has killed thousands and forced more than two million people to flee their homes  to battle the avengers in the south instead. mr. buhari then reconfigured those efforts after complaints that marauding soldiers had roughed up people and property while looking for militants in the south  creating even more resentment among the impoverished people who live there. militants have struck in the south in the past  kidnapping or killing oil workers and police officers to demand a greater share of the nations oil wealth. but the avengers seem bent on crippling nigerias economy while it is particularly fragile  striking at the core of mr. buharis plans for the nation. the avengers have sent oil  power and gas workers fleeing  torturing the multinational companies that burrow for oil underneath the waters. fuel deliveries around the country have stalled because almost everything that has to do with oil in nigeria right now has been tangled up by the militants. advertisement on the main highway in the southern port city of warri recently  a long row of fuel tankers sat on the side of the road  idle. a bent-back windshield wiper served as a makeshift clothesline. a mini tube of toothpaste rested on the dashboard of one truck. the truckers were stranded  waiting to fill up. they had been there a month. we are not asking for much  but to free the people of the niger delta from environmental pollution  slavery and oppression  the avengers wrote on their website  explaining their attacks. we want a country that will turn the creeks of the niger delta to a tourism heaven  a country that will achieve its full potentials  a country that will make health care system accessible by everyone. with niger delta still under the country nigeria we cant make it possible. mr. buharis government has said it is open to negotiating with the group. but it is already stretched thin. on the opposite side of the country  boko haram is still raging. mr. buhari has started a major offensive against the group that has made progress  but it has yet to stamp out the violence. another longtime battle is flaring in the middle of the country  between farmers and nomadic fulani herdsmen looking for grazing pastures. hundreds have been killed in battles as herdsmen roam into new territory to look for vegetation for their cattle. officials have blamed climate change and the nations rapidly growing population for the scarcity of pastureland. and with their demands for economic equality for the south  the avengers have been trying to stoke the aspirations of separatists elsewhere in the nation. more than four decades ago  at least one million people were killed during the nigerian civil war  when separatists led an uprising that created an independent republic of biafra in the southeast. it lasted three years  until 1970. now  a biafran separatist movement is simmering again  with the police and protesters clashing regularly since october  when a prominent activist was arrested and jailed. some have accused the nigerian security forces of seeking out and killing protesters. advertisement the avengers are fanning the separatist sentiments  invoking the biafran movement and calling for a brexit-style referendum to split the nation along several fault lines. the south has long been a reservoir of anger and resistance  a place where countless billions in oil revenue are extracted for the benefit of distant politicians and companies abroad. yet drinking water and electricity can be scarce  and the swamps people live around are regularly polluted with exxon valdez-size spills  casting an oily sheen on the creeks and coating the roots of dense mangroves in black goo. many people in the predominantly christian south say they believe that mr. buhari  a muslim from the north  is neglecting them for political or sectarian reasons  even though conditions were also grim under his predecessor  goodluck jonathan  a christian southerner. you always say you fought for the unity of this country during the civil war  the avengers taunted mr. buhari on their website. you havent been to the niger delta  how can you know what the people are facing.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. in his recent speech  mr. buhari recalled the horrors of the civil war  when he served in the military fighting biafrans. the president has a vision of one united nigeria and is prepared to do everything to keep it as one  he said. this spring  mr. buhari announced that he would personally introduce a $1 billion cleanup program of the oil-polluted niger delta area. it was to be mr. buharis first visit to the region since taking office  but with the avengers movement raging  the president abruptly canceled his trip. residents of delta state felt slighted. years have passed with neglect  deprivation  environmental deprivation  poverty  no electricity  no roads  no hospital  no schools  but we are living in the country of nigeria  said blessing gbalibi  a fuel-truck driver raised in the creek communities. over there in abuja  he added  referring to the capital  they are taking our resources. yet many niger delta residents like mr. gbalibi oppose the avengers because their acts of sabotage have degraded the already-poor quality of life in the region. spills from explosions have further polluted farmland and fishing holes. mr. gbalibi and his fuel truck were among those stuck on the side of the highway for a month because the avengers had disrupted fuel distribution. about a decade ago  another band of militants  the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta  prowled the creeks  blowing up pipelines. the federal government reined it in by setting up an amnesty program that offers cash and job training  some of it overseas  for more than 30 000 militants and residents  according to paul boroh  a retired brigadier general and the special adviser to mr. buhari for the program. advertisement but oil revenue finances the program  and the fall in oil prices prompted the president to consider ending the amnesty program at the end of last year. mr. boroh said he had lobbied to keep the plan for now  but to phase it out over the next two years. the avengers movement sprang up around the time the president was considering an end to the program  prompting many niger delta residents to wonder if the shadowy group is made of former militants hoping to keep up amnesty payments. the amnesty program is far from universally loved in the creeks. many residents say payments are routinely siphoned by corrupt community leaders. others say the job training they received was virtually useless. oil companies prefer to hire foreigners  they complain  or they hire locals only on a short-term basis  and then nothing. the program sent mike gomero  a former militant  to learn the teachings of mohandas k. gandhi and the rev. martin luther king jr. at a two-week session in south africa. he is no longer blowing up pipelines. but he still does not have a job. the amnesty program is not a solution  said williams welemu  a former member of the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta. its palliative. communities like ugborodo  so deep in the winding creeks that it is at least two hours from the mainland by speedboat  are dotted with homes that are little more than tiny zinc huts on islands that are sinking into the sea. they are filled with unemployed residents trained as geologists  pipe fitters and marine engineers. one of them  collins bemigho  stood along a dirty swamp  orange flares from a giant chevron terminal glowing in the distance behind him. he complained about a lack of indoor plumbing  of good health care or a secondary school  and then pointed to a thick pipe jutting from the water. if i wanted to bust a pipeline  i could do that right here  mr. bemigho said. were not rewarded for being well behaved. follow dionne searcey on twitter @dionnesearcey. a version of this article appears in print on july 18  2016  on page a4 of the new york edition

movies,advertisement supported by op-ed contributors by frank bruni  ross douthat and lynda obst the timess movie-mad columnists frank bruni and ross douthat met online with the hollywood insider lynda obst  a movie producer and the writer of  most recently  sleepless in hollywood: tales from the new abnormal in the movie business  to banter and bicker about the academy awards and who should and who will win an oscar. frank bruni: lynda  ross: so great to be reunited! last year we deconstructed the oscars after the ceremony. this year we switch from monday-morning quarterbacks to (hold on for a hugely mixed metaphor) cassandras. so much to discuss: oscars and #metoo  the shows declining ratings  whether political complaints will doom three billboards outside ebbing  missouri. what do you find most interesting about the oscars this year? lynda obst: i am very cranky this year because my favorite movie wasnt nominated. in fact  its the first time in 97 years of voting that i didnt fill out all 10 candidates in my preferential best picture ballot. bruni: ninety-seven years? lynda  you dont look a day over 95! but seriously  dont keep us in suspense! what movie was that? obst: it was the florida project. a little gem of a gigantic movie. it broke my heart in two and then made it soar. the academy  reflecting the nation  wasnt in the mood for its compassion or grace. ross douthat: i was also surprised the florida project wasnt nominated  though my major beef was over the exclusion of i  tonya from the ranks of best picture nominees. i suspect it lost votes over a sense that the script was too sympathetic to a subject who probably did know more about the kneecapping of nancy kerrigan than she admitted and the film implied. but i thought that it was a far more interesting and sympathetically critical and ultimately realistic portrait of its sociological subject  the white working class  than three billboards  which was false from start to finish. bruni: i had some of your same misgivings about billboards  which sort of went off the rails as it went along. i  tonya is exquisitely timed: it and lady bird both tackle class in a way that movies often dont and that seems oddly cognizant of the political discussion in the wake of trumps election  dont you think? obst: dont start me on three billboards! i think the backlash has nothing to do with politics but with people discussing it and finding that there were others who did not find any nuance or reality (except maybe in woody harrelsons portrayal). douthat: i hope youre right that three billboards will be doomed by an aesthetic backlash  lynda. obst: lady bird and i  tonya were two totally different experiences as a woman for me. lady bird was exquisite  a rare coming-of-age story from our point of view  and though i grew up thousands of miles and decades away  it was mine. i  tonya had a painful  confused tone to me  which reflected the confusion of its main character  i suppose  but the juxtaposition of the domestic abuse with rock montages were jarring and painful. douthat: my assumption has been  just from eyeballing the betting line  that the voters are looking for a movie that speaks to the trumpian moment  circled three billboards because it tried to portray trump country (albeit from the perspective of a brit writer-director whose familiarity with real rural america seemed  limited)  rejected the post as too staid and old-fashioned  and now seem to be leaning toward the shape of water because its about racial and sexual minorities uniting to defeat the real monster of white male suburban patriarchy  and thus a perfect political movie  from a certain perspective  at least  for the times. what do you both think? bruni: dont get me started on the shape of water  whose swampy charms elude me to a point where i cant ponder the politics of it. it felt strained  silly  and has ruined hard-boiled eggs for me forevermore. omelets only from now on. obst: well  thanks  ross  for explaining shape of water  because really i had no clue why people were going batty for it. i didnt realize it was woke! benny goodman  who knew? it seemed so ridiculous to me as i fall in love with people and language. bruni: i want to pick up on something important that lynda said  from our point of view  about lady bird  which is quietly revolutionary in its way and very much of this moment. as greta gerwig has said in interviews  including a few that i was privileged to do with her  she very much wanted to write and direct a movie in which the female teenage protagonist wasnt having things happen to her but was  instead  making them happen. that should not be unusual. and yet it is  lynda  isnt it? obst: yes  absolutely  frank  that is utterly revolutionary and why this moment of the emergence of women filmmakers and writers having a voice and the power to use it is so critical. like black filmmakers  and the explosive revolutionary power of the black panther  seeing your story being told or even just your point of view opens a whole universe of new tales. but never underestimate the academys ability to overlook women. i dont think this will accrue to a surprise victory for lady bird. if any surprises happen (and i doubt that)  it more likely would be protest votes for get out  i think. douthat: yes  in certain ways im surprised there isnt more momentum for lady bird given that its female-directed and female-centric and thus  in certain ways  a perfect answer to the (reasonable) claim that the movie industry is performatively anti-sexist but practically misogynist. but its so far removed from high politics (which is part of its charm) and it doesnt have the big thudding message that the shape of water seems to offer. bruni: this is what to me is so weird about hollywood. or so depressing. theres a lack of subtlety. honoring lady bird (which so deserves that) would  in its way  be as much a celebration of the #metoo moment and spirit as having only female presenters (the sag awards) or only black dresses (the globes). obst: lip service  stylists  statements  are cheap. voting in secrecy for others  for your competition  through your resentment and rivalry  is hard. another subtle thing that has changed besides the downsizing (the name of another movie i liked this year that went underappreciated and under-seen) of our audience: thanks to the ridiculous excesses of pig/monster harvey in trying to buy oscar votes  a beloved perk of the academy awards season is over. i am talking about the now near-absence of the elegant little luncheons or dinners that the studios or financiers would throw to promote the movies in nomination. this is where we realized that our more distant friends werent dead  remarried or in rehab. and more important where we swapped opinions and affected one anothers thinking. now  without parties  we dont influence one another anymore. instead we are influenced by social media and m.s.m. like everyone else and we are just another voting bloc or guild. its sad  and no longer as distinct or eccentric as it was. boohoo. the academy has banned our fun parties. cry me a river. douthat: does that raise the odds of upsets or reduce them? obst: reduce them! douthat: sad! but of course no matter where the voters come down theyll probably be celebrating a movie that most of america hasnt seen  which is truer and truer every year. indeed theres a sense in which the obvious quest for political relevance might be a way to compensate for the fact that despite widening the slate of nominees  the academy cant seem to find the old-school movies that were artful and commanded a mass audience. i wonder if we think thats a problem with the nominating process or with the movie industry itself  which is now polarized between yuge repetitious blockbusters and small films pitched to niche audiences and the awards circuit. will there ever be a titanic (if you will) list of nominees again  a roster of movies that everyone has seen and has an opinion about long before the academy gets around to voting on them? bruni: i think youve hit on something big there  ross  in terms of movie-industry polarization between the mass-market commercial colossi and the more artistic fare. youve got lady bird in one corner  the last x-men extravaganza in the other. youve got either no explosions or so many fireballs in the last 15 minutes that you leave the theater half-blind and with temporary hearing loss. but that leads me to a quasi-prediction  or rather a question: couldnt get out take the prize because it best straddles the divide? bold idea  familiar genre  big box office? its like the centrist candidate in an election with only far-left and far-right alternatives otherwise. obst: if theres a surprise winner  it could be get out. add all the people who just loved this movie  and all the pro-diversity voters  plus everyone who liked nothing more than this  and its a big number given this weird algorithm of preferential voting. and the industry loves get out so much. it didnt cost much. it was wildly clever and reinvented a genre. it was funny and scary. it showed us life from an african-american point of view  in a way that i will never experience the suburbs where i grew up in the same way again. and there will be so many new movies created in its wake! bruni: i guess you could say dunkirk is also a centrist candidate  but everyone i know who saw it was so cold to it that its one of the rare best picture nominees i skipped. dont tell anyone! oops  too late. obst: dont forget that steven spielberg and christopher nolan (and ridley scott) are among the only directors who make commercial blockbusters  or at least  if not blockbusters  big studio movies that reliably are nominated for oscars  and that is a lot to ask of this diversifying academy. and in the old days  the studios did not have indie filmmakers all over the globe making $3 million movies of their choosing to compete with. they had a monopoly. douthat: but theyre the only directors who get the chance to make movies that are big and also serious because every other promising director gets shunted into superhero franchises and is never seen again! obst: many young filmmakers are dying to make a superhero franchise  and it is a mark of success. he or she is not shunted. look at rian johnson  from looper and brick indie darling to star wars: the last jedi; patty jenkins  monster to wonder women; ryan coogler  creed to black panther. i could go on. few filmmakers dont want to play with an iconic character and $200 million! there are the failures  but they wanted to go there. douthat: fair: shunted is the wrong word for something that happens all too willingly. and of course if i were offered the chance to make a star wars movie  i wouldnt say no. (and i would make a better one than last jedi  call me  kathleen kennedy!) bruni: lyndas right about the volitional lunge for superhero movies. the question is: how do we stanch that desire? halt that lunge? i would be quite content to live out the rest of my days without seeing one more cape  one more mask  one more superpower. enough. obst: of course those movies are not for you. and their profits  in the best of all possible worlds  would support movies that are for you. but i cant tell you thats definitively true. what is good news is that those movies are made for a ready audience  and if theyre good  they will keep getting made  like wonder woman and black panther. but the bad ones  and many of the sequels  were getting rejected both domestically and increasingly around the world where they are now making more of their own domestic product. so the domestic smaller movie may find a home in some studios. and if they greenlight the right ones  it may be a small revival of these at the studios and at oscar time. bruni: are you telling me that in a world with too many silos  separations and gated enclaves  geographic  political  ideological and cultural  i have to retreat to hbo  netflix and amazon and leave the multiplex to teenagers? douthat: this is why  even though i think nolans dunkirk and phantom thread (a great  strange movie that very happily has no political valence whatsoever) were actually the best movies  id be happy to see lady bird or even get out win  because they point to a world where the industrys desire for diversification and post-#metoo female empowerment leads to successful  interesting films that arent just avengers clones with more black or female faces. and that arent  well  kind of bad  like billboards and the shape of water. bruni: im with you on lady bird and get out for that reason but also this  which weve hinted at but which id like to spell out: they so utterly affirm the better art that you get when you have a diverse group of people telling the stories. lady bird could only have been made with its precise tone  sensibility and subtle powers of observation about that characters experience by a woman  greta gerwig. get out could only have aced its satire the way it did  maybe only have been conceived with that cleverness  by an african-american writer-director  jordan peele. obst: i think all three of us are in agreement there. and they were both successful commercially  a very good lesson that has been heard far and wide here. both are among the hottest directors in town  and both have modeled new kinds of movies that can get made that could not have even a year ago. douthat: lets wind things up by taking the preferences weve expressed and converting them to predictions. in the big four categories  director  actor  actress  picture  who should win and then who will? obst: two caveats so i can work on monday: (1) my should wins are not my votes. as an academy member  i never reveal my vote. (2) every actor and director nominated  each of whom who i obviously want to and intend to work with  did a magnificent job. that said: who should win best picture: the florida project. who will win: the shape of water. for director  should win: sean baker for the florida project. will win: guillermo del toro for the shape of water. for actor  should win: denzel washington in roman j. israel  esq. will win: gary oldman in darkest hour. for actress  should win: brooklyn prince in the florida project. will win: frances mcdormand in three billboards. douthat: frank? bruni: i find the best picture race a muddle  and will go out on a limb and say that get out will win. should win? lady bird. gary oldman clearly will win best actor. id stake my left eye on it  and im down to just that eye. should win? hmmmm. daniel day-lewis  but hes got a thousand oscars already. pretty much all the ones that didnt go to meryl streep. guillermo del toro will get best director because shape is pretty and hyper-designed and audacious in tone (though it doesnt work). should win? greta gerwig. and for best actress  the award will go to frances mcdormand  whos so brilliant across the board that im thrilled for her. it should go to margot robbie. her last 15 minutes in i  tonya  at the olympics  are raw screen acting at its most effective. ross? douthat: oldman will win best actor  for a deserving performance  but even so (and however predictably) daniel day-lewis gave the best performance of the nominees. mcdormand will get best actress; since you chose robbie (a good choice)  frank  ill go nuts and say that saoirse ronan should win  because the success of lady bird is unimaginable without her. director will go to del toro; it should go to nolan for an achievement in dunkirk that was initially maybe overpraised but is now underestimated. and picture  picture  picture  i give my should by a hair to dunkirk over phantom thread  and i have zero confidence in the academy  they gave the statue to crash for gods sake  so im expecting to be throwing things at my television when three billboards sneaks past the shape of water for the win. bruni: in a matter of hours  well know which of us is the champion soothsayer or at least said the most correct sooths. (is sooth a noun? i nominate it to be!) ross  lynda  great to dwell briefly in the empire of oscar with you anew. enjoy the event  even the best song nominee performances  if you can. and thanks. frank bruni and ross douthat are op-ed columnists for the times. lynda obst is a movie producer  among others  of intersteller  good girls revolt and sleepless in seattle and the author  most recently  of sleepless in hollywood: tales from the new abnormal in the movie business. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter. advertisement    collapse see my options

movies,advertisement by the associated pressmay 2  2018  2:35 p.m. e.d.t.  las vegas   the summer movie going season roared to life with the record-breaking opening weekend for "avengers: infinity war " but industry leaders want audiences and theater owners to know that a healthy movie business is not just about the superheroes. last week at the 2018 cinemacon convention  where movie theater owners  exhibitors  celebrities and studio executives gather in las vegas to preview their upcoming slates  attendees got a look at what's to come in the next calendar year  and what's worth getting excited about  from tiffany haddish to the irresistible movie musical. here are some of the biggest takeaways: ___ tiffany haddish's star keeps rising it's funny to think that last year at this time  most people didn't know who tiffany haddish was. her star-making film  "girls trip " didn't arrive in theaters until july and when the cast took the stage at the convention one year ago  she was the unknown alongside her more famous co-stars. this year  the tables were turned. haddish brought her high-wattage star and irresistibly funny honesty to multiple presentations  including universal for "night school " with kevin hart  and "the secret life of pets 2 " and paramount for a tyler perry comedy and then again for lionsgate's "uncle drew." haddish had the notoriously staid crowd in stitches  talking about everything from her aching big toe to how she knows when a movie is going to be funny. (it's when the crew is laughing  she says.) diversity and diverse slates superheroes and brands are only part of the equation  said basically every studio except disney  which has become the king of the box office relying on both  with brands that include star wars  marvel pixar and its live-action and animation properties. instead of trying to copy the hollywood behemoth  the other studios talked up their differences. advertisement for some  like amazon and stx  that meant going for a shock-factor.  amazon studios turned some stomachs showing a scene from luca guadagnino's "suspiria" remake over lunch. the thriller  starring dakota johnson  looks like a cross between "black swan" and "the exorcist" and had some attendees tweeting about being "traumatized" over the images. the smaller distribution label stx went for the shock factor with a red-band trailer for "the happytime murders " which featured melissa mccarthy snorting drugs alongside some puppet detectives in the very r-rated comedy. advertisement others talked up their prestige dramas  like "la la land" director damien chazelle's neil armstrong biopic "first man " starring ryan gosling  and "12 years a slave" director steve mcqueen's intense revenge drama "widows " with viola davis. diverse slates also meant diverse casts and filmmakers which  john fithian  the president and ceo of the national association of theatre owners said customers are demanding.

movies,advertisement by dave itzkoffapril 23  2018  burbank  calif.  everything ends  even if it might not feel that way right now for joe and anthony russo. more than a year into the making of avengers: infinity war  these directing brothers were shuttling around the walt disney studios here one evening in march  putting the finishing touches on their latest superhero blockbuster. the tasks that awaited them were mostly routine and unglamorous: rerecording dialogue with elizabeth olsen  who plays the scarlet witch; taking their last looks at a new trailer for the film  which opens friday and sets up a battle royal in which every costumed champion in the marvel universe must defend it against a genocidal titan named thanos. with these duties out of the way  the russo brothers have one more assignment to complete: successfully bringing the curtain down on the most lucrative franchise in hollywood history. the 18 movies that preceded infinity war were a risky feat unto themselves: a multihour narrative in which each installment handed off to the next  sometimes elegantly  sometimes awkwardly  and events in previous episodes had lasting effects on those that followed. advertisement now marvel is trying something equally unprecedented and potentially far riskier. in infinity war and a subsequent avengers movie that will open in may 2019  the russos need to seamlessly incorporate dozens of major characters  all while bringing the franchise to a satisfying conclusion. advertisement were not making any bones about the fact that were ending the first 10 years  joe russo said later that night. thats what we pushed for. a preview of the film. this was hardly the outcome that the entertainment industry anticipated when the marvel studio kicked off its current campaign in 2008 with iron man (considered a second-tier character at the time  but one of the few whose rights it controlled). a decade later  the runaway success of that film laid the foundation for a pantheon of marvel movies  including captain america  thor and guardians of the galaxy. these films revitalized the careers of enduring actors like robert downey jr. (as the billionaire industrialist tony stark  a.k.a. iron man) and raised the profiles of relative unknowns like chris evans (as the supersoldier steve rogers  alias captain america). the studio has breathed lucrative new life into its decades-old comic-book properties  and built a ravenous fan base for each new character it introduces at the multiplex. (witness the $1.3 billion global box office for its latest hit  black panther  which opened in february.) now marvel says it wants to clear the table it has spent the last 10 years arranging and make way for something new. telling a great story requires a great ending  kevin feige  the marvel studios president  said. when you dedicate yourself to that  it shifts the way you think. audiences are about to find out what finality looks like for a motion-picture money-minting machine: will the story actually come to a conclusion? will characters die  and will actors leave the series? advertisement whatever the answers  they have already been reached with the help of the russo brothers  two of marvels most consistent and diligent  if not widely recognized  filmmakers. when they finish their avengers movies  which they shot back to back over 18 months  the russos will complete their own improbable arc  from indie-cinema oddballs to tv comedy moguls to directors of possibly the biggest franchise in movie history. the brothers  anthony  48  the bespectacled brainstormer  and joe  46  the square-jawed pragmatist  have contrasting but complementary energies. as mr. downey described them  anthony is a bit more reflective  a yin guy  while joe is the intense yang of the partnership: bitcoin was invented to keep joe russo from killing himself during the last 20 percent of the shoot  mr. downey said. when theyre together  mr. downey added  its like the two of them make a third thing thats better than any one person could be. the russos grew up in cleveland  where their father  basil m. russo  served as democratic majority leader of the city council. when the city went into an economic tailspin in the 1970s and 80s  the brothers immersed themselves in movies and learned to appreciate their creative isolation. as anthony russo explained it  the virtue of growing up in the industrial midwest is you have nothing to rub up against you and no one to tell you that you cant do what you want to do  because nobodys doing anything. you can just be a dreamer. they spent three years and $30 000 writing and directing an independent feature  pieces  about three brothers  also named the russos  who dabble in crime. despite some withering reviews  variety called it an unabashed vanity project  pieces caught the attention of steven soderbergh at the 1997 slamdance film festival. with his help  the russos made their first studio movie  a comic crime caper called welcome to collinwood  with george clooney  william h. macy and sam rockwell. but it flopped at its release in 2002. advertisement for the next several years  the russos focused on directing television shows  including lucky  a short-lived fx series  and arrested development  the rapid-fire satire that became a cult hit on fox. despite critical acclaim  arrested development got notoriously low ratings. but the russos said this lack of attention was a blessing in disguise  allowing them to experiment with narrative  tone and pacing  unencumbered by interfering network executives. they so didnt get the show that they really didnt care what you did  anthony russo said  adding  it was a huge creative upside. the russos used nbcs community  another well-reviewed comedy with a meager viewership  to stage elaborate tributes to star wars and the spaghetti westerns of sergio leone. it was here that their work caught marvels attention. at the time  the studio was generating hits with its earliest superhero offerings  made by established filmmakers  iron man  directed by jon favreau; captain america: the first avenger  directed by joe johnston. but marvel wanted to expand its portfolio rapidly and bring in tv directors. marvel also wanted to shift the tone of its captain america movies  starting with the 2014 sequel  the winter soldier. the first one was a fairly patriotic  gung-ho world war ii movie  said christopher markus  who wrote the captain america films with stephen mcfeely. you cant make a string of those before you get slightly nauseous. get the most out of your screen time with movie and tv recommendations  news and commentary from new york times experts. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the goal of the winter soldier  mr. markus said  was to show captain america losing faith in all the institutions that had made him  giving you a way to see him as relevant in the modern era. advertisement the russos envisioned the winter soldier as a modern-day upgrade of espionage thrillers like three days of the condor  and the studio responded strongly. when the movie sold $714 million in tickets worldwide  mr. feige said the russos redefined the franchise  not just the cap franchise but all the marvel movies going forward. they found a way to keep the wonder  keep the spectacle  but ground it even more in realism  mr. feige said. which is a word i use lightly when it comes to our movies. the russos succeeded again with captain america: civil war  an overstuffed 2016 sequel in which the black panther (chadwick boseman) and a new incarnation of spider-man (tom holland) were introduced  and the adventurers took sides in a conflict between cap and iron man. even before civil war became a $1.15 billion global smash  marvel had already started putting the pieces in place for what mr. feige called the big finale of the initial story line we were developing. the plan was ambitious: mr. markus and mr. mcfeely would write two avengers movies  generated from a 60-page manifesto they started working on in 2015. all the major marvel heroes had to be accommodated  and still more characters would be introduced. not every scene can be 25 people in a room  mr. mcfeely said. youre going to have to make kickball teams and then have a tournament. with scripts in hand  the russos would film these movies consecutively. in mr. feiges mind  there were no other directors who could handle the task of doing three straight years of filmmaking. mr. feige said  there are two of them  which helps. but their individual stamina is unmatched. the russos moved from los angeles to georgia for two years  where avengers: infinity war and its sequel were shot  principally at pinewood atlanta studios. (they estimate that they took a break of about three weeks between filming the two movies.) they said making the movies this way was an irresistible challenge  one that has been attempted by very few directors  including the wachowskis (the matrix series) and peter jackson (the lord of the rings and hobbit franchises)  and a test of their fortitude. describing the process  anthony russo said  youre a really good marathon runner and you know how to train for it. all of a sudden  youre running a double marathon. you cant really understand it until you do it. advertisement the russos acknowledge that the films were made this way  in part  for economic reasons: its cheaper for marvel to hire actors  dozens of them  some of whom are very costly  for months at a time  rather than make individual deals for each movie. though they must serve many corporate masters at disney and marvel  and mr. feige is known for having a strong hand in his films  the russos say they were given the latitude to make the movies they want to make. its no different than making any kind of narrative in a medium where capitalism thrives  joe russo said. you have to have a zen resilience about what it is that you want to do  and then do a really good job at it. and everybody stays out of your hair. mr. downey  who first worked with the russos on civil war  said they were well served by their tv training  which has taught them to be quick and collaborative. at any given moment on these films  mr. downey said  weve got 80 things that are going to blow up  collide  story points that are all about to happen at once. when one of the russos had a new idea  he said  they would approach him with a gentle query: let me pitch you this. no one takes it personally  and then the idea emerges  mr. downey said. it ends up an amalgam of everything that didnt hit the floor. the russos arent revealing much about how  exactly  their avengers movies will bring closure to this phase of the marvel cinematic saga. (they wouldnt even disclose the title of the movie that follows infinity war  protesting that even this much information would be a spoiler.) advertisement ultimately  joe russo said  what youll see by the end of the movies is  what does it cost to be a hero in a world where there are no easy answers? i think thats the world we live in. death is a staple of comic books. beloved characters are killed off all the time  sometimes replaced by successors who inherit their costumes and identities: bucky becomes the new captain america; jane foster the new thor. theres no reason to believe that their motion-picture counterparts arent similarly mortal and similarly interchangeable. mr. evans has made no secret of his desire to move beyond the captain america movies. meanwhile  mr. downey  who introduced himself in a phone interview as robert downey jr.  retired film actor  is already working on his next prospective tentpole movie  the voyage of dr. dolittle. he talked about his time with marvel in retrospective tones  and reflected on an encounter with keanu reeves  who at the time had just finished making the first matrix movie. i was like  hey  dude  howd it go? mr. downey recalled. he said  ive been on another planet. right now  ive been on the planet dolittle for a while. being detached from it has given me a lot of warmth  affection and objectivity about this past decade. of course  the marvel engine will keep chugging away. there will be more movies with some of these characters  mr. feige said  and with lots of new characters. disneys pending acquisition of fox would add even more familiar heroes to marvels toy chest  including the x-men and fantastic four. but mr. feige said it was way too soon to make plans for these properties. wed love to have all the characters back  mr. feige said. its a dream. but were plenty busy with the next five films. advertisement the russos  too  are preparing for their post-avengers lives. they have established their own production company  agbo films  whose executives include mr. markus and mr. mcfeely and which has already secured $250 million in private chinese funding. the brothers are elliptical about whether there are more marvel movies in their future. we wanted to maximize our options as storytellers and artists  anthony russo said. weve structured our business life in a way to support that. it can be  or it cant be. weve kept all options open. joe russo said there are still some very personal projects we want to make  adding that he and anthony want to nurture up-and-coming filmmakers just as mr. soderbergh did for them. we owe a karmic debt to the universe because of what steven did for us  he said. the reality  though  is that the russos are not even finished with avengers. once infinity war is released  there is still a whole additional movie for them to construct from untold hours of raw footage  a task that they estimate will take them at least until the end of the year. there are months of work left on it  anthony russo said. it will be very cathartic for us to come out the other end. thats when our brains can open up to whats next. a version of this article appears in print on april 29  2018  on page ar1 of the new york edition with the headline: for avengers  a daring ending.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement supported by sporting by laura lee smith st. petersburg  fla.  you wouldnt peg me as an indycar fan. im a bookish  nervous woman staring down midlife  someone who likes to be quiet and who tries hard not to go out in the sun. i hate driving fast  i loathe aggressive drivers  and i have experienced a number of serious anxiety attacks when trying to navigate crowded interstates at high speeds. but heres the thing: i love racecars. i grew up in a motor-head family. my two brothers and i had a kings ransom of hot wheels and matchbox cars  and we vroomed them relentlessly around the living room baseboards  across the kitchen table  along the back of the console tv. my dad is a gear head and speed freak; some of my earliest memories are of his taking us to drag-racing time trials and to watch unlimited hydroplanes taking flight in miami marine stadium. i married a motor head  too  a gentle man who speaks softly and makes himself a cup of hot tea every night  but who can recite lines from steve mcqueens le mans and who recently affixed a huge 65 racing decal to his vintage volvo (just for fun  he says). so when indycar recently came to florida for the firestone grand prix of st. petersburg  i was there  heart pumping  eyes popping  ears ringing. a sea of indycars buzzed violently around the streets of this winsome little florida city  and the vehicular throng could not be more thrilling or more vibrant. the world was suddenly alive with metallic  high-speed color  and the sweet thrill of my hot wheels childhood came rushing back. the sound of 24 indycars in flat-out combat was a hivelike buzzing  a high-intensity hum that faded when the cars rounded a curve out of sight but that re-upped when they appeared in the straightaway. the firestone grand prix is the annual opening race of the verizon indycar series. for me  the pulse point of the race is in the absurd dichotomy of its setting. nearly two dozen venerable indycars  the hands-down goliaths of american testosterone  hurtle through the streets of one of floridas artsiest and most comely neighborhoods. indycar in st. pete  a tradition since 2005  is a gift. it puts st. petersburg in the league of some of the most storied locations in motor sports. think monaco or le mans. it lets the nation see florida  beautiful and complex and mysterious and thrilling  in a different light  at least for a few days. florida gets such a bad rap. were the boom-and-bust court jesters of the continental united states  and sometimes im convinced were seen by our compatriots as a cutely dumb  slightly embarrassing appendage populated entirely by retirees  rednecks  theme parks and opioids. weve got people living under bridges and shootings on end and mortifyingly low education funding. flori-duh theyre calling us. weve got so much perceived crazy we earned our own meme: florida man. still  downtown st. pete is pretty  darn it  seriously pretty  with crisply manicured landscaping  waterfront bistros  blocks of art deco floridiana and an army of chortling sea gulls that seem to ascend on cue to fandango against a subtropic sunrise. and into this artsy  balmy shangri-la comes  for one weekend  a loud  lionhearted parade of real-live action heroes in bona fide batmobiles. just look at the names on the drivers roster: will power. takuma sato. josef newgarden. theyre like marvels avengers  a troupe of dauntless young intellects in flame-retardant suits  driving vehicles that have sprung fully formed from the imaginations of every kid who ever fashioned a superhero cape out of a bedsheet  which  of course  was all of us. all i could think  as i watched the pre-race ceremonies  the drivers shimmy into their cockpits  the engines pop and buzz to life  the pace car leads the contenders to the course  was that this was  well  the most impressive thing ever. and its in florida. take that  hanging chads. this is the haut monde of motor sports  the fastest cars  the most challenging circuits  the most expensive technologies. its also earsplitting  adrenaline-chugging fun  the chance to stand mere feet from a scathing swarm of mammoth automotive hornets hurtling at more than 200 miles per hour through a winding street course. when the race began  i was atop a parking garage adjacent to the urbane dali museum. from there  the view of turns 1 and 2 were pristine  and the vantage seemed safer. turn 9 funneled the raging cars into a straightaway overlooking a tranquil cotillion of anchored yachts. watching practice runs earlier in the day  i became keenly aware that a single errant rivet from one of these high-tech missiles would be enough to hurt a person unlucky enough to be standing nearby. this race can kill spectators  and it has. i decided to take my chances on top of the parking garage. one hundred and 10 laps later  sbastian bourdais (a st. petersburg resident!) took the checkered flag. i was pink with sunburn and exhausted from the stimulation. indycar needs florida  too. theres only one sunshine state and only one sunshine city  and that would be st. petersburg  which holds the guinness world record for most consecutive sunny days (768). its an american monte carlo. a lot of things about florida may be a mess  but spring weather isnt one of them. we live in paradise. a view of a march st. petersburg sun glittering on a speeding indycars brightly painted chassis is a sight to behold. by kicking off its season in st. pete  indycar hitches its wagon to a hundred-year history of florida car racing  one that brings to mind sebring  nascar and malcolm campbell setting speed records on the beaches of daytona in the late 1920s. this year  firestone announced the grand prix will continue until at least 2020  and hopefully beyond. thats good news for florida. and good news for indycar. and good news for me  too. ah  st. pete. ah  florida. well played. you need this sort of event. laura lee smith is

movies,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by julian sanchez its a hollywood clich thats been adopted by villains from the trickster god loki in marvels the avengers to james bonds skyfall nemesis raoul silva: they are captured  only for the heroes to realize  too late!  that being caught was part of the villains evil plan all along. with fridays release of an indictment detailing project lakhta  the information operations component of russias efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election  its worth asking whether president vladimir v. putin of russia has been reading from a similar script. the charging document released by the justice department names 13 russian nationals associated with the innocuous-sounding internet research agency  a team of well-funded professional trolls who carried out a disinformation campaign that spread from social media to real-world rallies. if there were any lingering doubts that russias intervention was aimed at harming hillary clintons campaign and bolstering donald trumps  an internal directive quoted in the indictment spells it out explicitly: use any opportunity to criticize hillary and the rest (except sanders and trump  we support them). that russia should have preferred mr. trumps victory to mrs. clintons is hardly a surprise: the real estate mogul had long been open in his fawning admiration for autocratic leaders generally and mr. putin in particular. but in any game of strategy  the best moves are those that accomplish multiple objectives. fridays indictment should serve as a reminder that project latkha didnt merely aim to influence the outcome of the election  but also its tone  and americans attitudes toward their own democratic institutions. theres a critical back story to russias interference: a longstanding kremlin grudge against mrs. clinton  cemented in 2011 when  as secretary of state  she cast doubt on whether russias parliamentary elections  plagued by allegations of fraud and vote rigging  had been free and fair. the bulk of the russian teams online trolling efforts were directed at mrs. clinton  but the indictment notes that they also took aim at other  republican candidates; mr. trump  bernie sanders and the green party candidate  jill stein  were spared. the trio had something more than opposition to mrs. clinton in common: a central theme of their campaigns was that the american political system is fundamentally rigged  the same claim that had so incensed mr. putin. this same theme crops up in many of the russian front groups attacks: hillary clinton has already committed voter fraud during the democrat iowa caucus  one social media post declared. one of the more memorable stunts the russian team sponsored  hiring an american to attend rallies dressed as mrs. clinton in prison garb  toting an ersatz jail cell  fits the same pattern: she had to be cast not merely as an inferior candidate  but as a criminal who could win only through corruption. mr. trump was vehemently committed to the same message  not only leading those infamous chants of lock her up! but routinely declaring that if he were defeated  which polls throughout the campaign suggested was the most likely outcome  it would only be because democrats had rigged the vote. in hindsight  its natural to think that russias primary aim was to achieve the upset trump victory we now know occurred. but if they were relying on the same polls as the rest of the world  they would have regarded that as a long-shot. it seems at least as likely that they hoped a strong showing would position a defeated mr. trump as a thorn in mrs. clintons side  casting a pall over the legitimacy of her administration by fuming publicly about how he had been cheated. (they probably could not have imagined that mr. trump would do this even in victory  insisting without any evidence that he had lost the popular vote only because of voter fraud.) if we run with the hypothesis that russias core goal was to sow doubt about the integrity and fairness of american elections  and  by implication  erode the credibility of any criticism aimed at russias  then the ultimate exposure of their interference may well have been viewed not as frustrating that aim but as one more perverse way of advancing it. similar logic might account for russian cyberattacks on many state voter registration systems  first reported in june and more recently confirmed by department of homeland security officials. theres a consensus among cybersecurity experts that our unusually decentralized electoral system would make it extraordinarily difficult to surreptitiously change the result of a national election via hacking from abroad. but that might not be necessary: an attack might succeed just by creating widespread uncertainty about whether results had been altered  creating a crisis of legitimacy by the ultimate victor. united states intelligence officials themselves have voiced suspicions that russia intended to be caught. they were unusually loud in their intervention  james comey  the former f.b.i. director  told congress at a hearing last march. its almost as if they didnt care that we knew. wade into any online political discussion  where the conversation-ending accusation russian bot! has become a commonplace  and its hard to deny that its worked. if this sounds plausible  we should also consider that our political response  too  may have been part of the plan. with president trump dutifully refusing to implement retaliatory sanctions imposed on russia by a large bipartisan majority in congress  legislators have begun eyeing the online platforms on which so much disinformation spread. you created these platforms  senator dianne feinstein  democrat of california  railed at a panel of lawyers for google  facebook and twitter in november  and now theyre being misused. and you have to be the ones who do something about it  or we will. that would be a final irony  and an unpleasant one. no less than our meddling in their internal elections  russia has long resented united states criticism of the countrys repressive approach to online speech. their use of online platforms to tamper with our presidential race reads not only as an attack  but as an implicit argument: the freedoms you trumpet so loudly  your unwillingness to regulate political speech on the internet  your tolerance for anonymity  all these are weaknesses  which well prove by exploiting them. urgent as it is for the united states to take measures to prevent similar meddling in the next election  we should be careful that our response doesnt constitute a tacit agreement. julian sanchez is a senior fellow at the cato institute. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.   opinionthe editorial board opinionryan goodman advertisement    collapse see my options

"infinity war " which brings together some two dozen superheroes in the 10-year culmination of marvel studio's "cinematic universe " also set a new global opening record with $630 million even though it's yet to open in china  the world's second-largest movie market. it opens there may 11. according to the walt disney co.'s estimates sunday  "infinity war" overwhelmed the previous global best ("the fate of the furious" with $541.9 million) but narrowly topped "the force awakens" in north america. the "star wars" reboot debuted with $248 million in 2015  which would translate to about $260 million accounting for inflation. but both intergalactic behemoths belong to disney  which now owns nine of the top 10 opening weekends ever  six belonging to marvel releases. that includes "black panther " which has grossed $1.3 billion since opening in february and still managed to rank fifth at this weekend's box office  thanks partially to marvel fans self-programming a double-feature. advertisement the track record for marvel  along with the hyper  extravagant effort put into the long-planned "infinity war " made the record-setting weekend something of a fait accompli. after ten years  18 prior films and some $15 billion in box office  the weekend was an assured and long-awaited coronation for kevin feige's marvel  the most dominant force in a hollywood with precious few sure things. advertisement "to have now the biggest movie of domestic history as one of the marvel cinematic universe films seems like a fitting tribute to the marvel studios team which has had just an astounding  unmatched run in the last decade " said dave hollis  head of distribution for disney. by any measure  the 2-hour-and-40 minute-long "infinity war" is one of the largest films ever assembled. with a production budget reportedly almost $300 million  joe and anthony russo's film brings together the stars of marvel's superhero stable  including robert downey jr.'s iron man  chris hemsworth's thor  chadwick boseman's black panther  chris evans' captain america  mark ruffalo's hulk  and many more. it was shot over 18 months back-to-back with a sequel due out next summer. marvel spent years laying the groundwork for the big showdown  teasing its villain (josh brolin's thanos) since 2014. the result earned positive reviews (84 percent fresh on rotten tomatoes) and an a cinemascore from audiences. all but one of marvel's 19 cinematic universe releases has scored an a cinemascore. as if to further stamp its pronounced enormity  "infinity war" was also the first film shot entirely with imax cameras. (christopher nolan's "dunkirk" was mostly shot on imax.) imax screenings accounted for a record $41 million of the weekend's global ticket sales. greg foster  head of entertainment for imax corp  said the success of marvel stands apart from hollywood's other mega franchises. "this isn't something that their parents saw. this isn't an old franchise that their parents saw when they were 20 " said foster. "this is theirs. the marvel universe is the group of characters that this generation owns." no new wide releases dared to compete with "infinity war " which played at 4 474 theaters in north america. in a very distant second place was john krasinski's "a quiet place" with $10.7 million in its fourth week. with $148.2 million in total ticket sales  the paramount pictures thriller had topped the box office three of the last four weekends. paul dergarabedian  senior media analyst for comscore  credited marvel with the potent lead-up to "infinity wars" with "spider-man: homecoming " ''guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 " ''thor: ragnarok" and "black panther"  all successful and well-reviewed entries.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters.

movies,advertisement by bruce frettsapril 24  2018  seemingly one of the only marvel characters whos not in disneys soon-to-be-unleashed avengers: infinity war  venom is getting his own stand-alone film from columbia pictures. thats because the sony-owned studio controls the rights to the spider-man universe  which is where venom originated. but sony made a deal with marvel studios to share spidey  which is why tom holland can be seen slinging webs in infinity war. confused yet? venoms origin story  as dramatized in the new trailer  isnt quite so convoluted. an investigative journalist  eddie brock (tom hardy)  discovers that the diabolical dr. carlton drake (riz ahmed) is doing research with symbiotes  organisms that can merge with people and create superhuman hybrids. eddie soon finds his body invaded by one of these creatures and battles to use his new powers for good  not evil. the film also features michelle williams in her first superhero-movie role as eddies ex-wife. also making her marvel debut: the saturday night live alumna jenny slate as a do-gooder who asks eddie to aid in an attempt to defeat drake. embrace your inner antihero  the trailers tagline reads  and sony hopes moviegoers will do just that when venom hits theaters on oct. 5. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement  streaming  by                       glenn kenny   dec. 29  2017  as 2017 grinds to a halt  two media business stories promise to have a substantial impact on streaming video. the federal communications commission voted on dec. 14 to overturn obama-era regulations on net neutrality  which  simply put  prevented internet providers from playing favorites in terms of speed and bandwidth. the actual consequences may take time to become clear. parties who argued against the f.c.c.s ruling maintain that  for example  without regulation an internet provider may block or slow user access to  say  hulu and ease the connection to an entertainment service it owns or has an agreement with. which indirectly brings us to the other story: the impending merger of the walt disney company and certain major components of 21st century fox. this gigantic deal has inspired internet wags to imagine mash-ups of mickey mouse and the simpsons and wax lyrical about the potential flowerings within the marvel cinematic universe. because  in the latter case  the marvel franchises concerned with the x-men and the fantastic four have been the property of fox  while the avengers  who constitute the plurality of superheroes  roost with disney. soon they may all share the same galaxy  or playpen. but as the smarter business analysts know  superhero movies are relatively low on the list of concerns that  erm  animate this deal. no  this deal is about the future  about traditional movie studios trying to gain traction in the streaming market in the hope of overtaking already established platforms. advertisement earlier this year disney announced that it would let its licensing agreements with netflix lapse and start its own streaming service in 2019. the fox deal adds a substantial amount of content muscle to disneys intentions. we probably wont see direct ramifications for consumers for a while yet  possibly not at all in 2018. but the business of streaming  already a complicated one with a lot of players  is going to get even more interesting  and probably ugly  over the next 24 months and beyond. so weve got that to look forward to. advertisement but lets peek at the bright side for now. netflix recently shared with the new york times its slate of original films scheduled from january until april. i cant watch any of them yet  so im ill-equipped to assess them  but here are some titles that have potential. the polka king  directed by maya forbes and wallace wolodarsky  arrives jan. 12. as it stars jack black  ones first surmise might be that its mr. blacks patch on john candy and eugene levys schmenge brothers  polka-musician characters first seen on sctv. it is not. rather  its a fact-based comedy-drama about jan lewan  already the subject of a 2009 documentary  who combined music with a ponzi scheme to realize his ambition to rule polka and make more money than anyone whod previously ruled polka had ever dreamed of. the movie was well received when it played at the 2017 sundance film festival.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. on jan. 19  theres step sisters  a collegiate drama directed by charles stone iii. its plot linchpin is  yes  step dancing. mr. stone did a pretty good job with the 2002 nick cannon film drumline  which was about  yes  a marching band  so he might do the trick similarly here. a futile and stupid gesture is a movie title born of a phrase well known to devotees of the 1978 comedy milestone national lampoons animal house. it was coined by doug kenney  a comedy wunderkind with a genuinely unusual personality who was one of the movies screenwriters and a founding editor at national lampoon. fittingly the phrase serves as the title of kenneys biopic  directed by the comedy stalwart david wain. based on the book by josh karp  it stars will forte and features a bevy of contemporary comedy figures playing the real-life performers who went on to fame with animal house and saturday night live. joel mchale plays chevy chase  natasha lyonne is anne beatts  thomas lennon portrays michael odonoghue and seth green is christopher guest. the movie has its premiere on jan. 26. when we first met (feb. 9)  directed by ari sandel and starring alexandra daddario and robbie amell  looks quite a bit more ordinary. the plot hook for this rom-com fantasy is that mr. amell  after what he considers a perfect first night with ms. daddario  is upset that he is relegated to the friend zone (official synopsis words  not mine)  but he gets to travel back in time to alter the situation. march brings a revival of the benji franchise  with a brand-new film directed by brandon camp  the son of the series originator joe camp. its produced by jason blum  whos mostly famous for founding blumhouse productions  a company best known for horror pictures such as get out  paranormal activity  sinister  insidious and the attendant sequels. i doubt the prospects for a cute-dog-horror hybrid  though  and suspect a pre-emptive move to get a good childrens franchise going before disney establishes its own streaming service. march and april bring a couple of films with african-american themes and stories. roxanne roxanne  which played at 2017s sundance film festival and is scheduled to hit netflix sometime in march  is about lolita gooden  who became a force in hip-hop under the name roxanne shant. newcomer chant adams plays the rapper  while nia long plays her mother. also featured are mahershala ali  who won an oscar for moonlight  and adam horovitz  the beastie boy known as ad-rock. the writer-director of this movie  michael larnell  also

movies,advertisement supported by gamers are the new stars. esports arenas are the new movie theaters.  by nellie bowles video games are beginning their takeover of the real world.  across north america this year  companies are turning malls  movie theaters  storefronts and parking garages into neighborhood esports arenas. at the same time  content farms are spinning up in los angeles  where managers now see gamers as some peculiar new form of famous person to cultivate  half athlete  half influencer. and much of it is powered by the obsession with one game: fortnite. over the last month  people have spent more than 128 million hours on twitch just watching other people play fortnite  the game that took all the best elements of building  shooting and survival games and merged them into one.  how obsessed are people? after each of their wins this season  the houston astros  among many other sports teams  are doing a very specific dance  their arms in the air  fingers spread  their legs bent  toes tapping rapidly. its a fortnite dance.  fortnite content received 2.4 billion views on youtube in february alone  according to tubular insights. so yes  people love playing video games  but people also love to watch others compete at them.  esports are  finally  just like any other sport. for gaming  this is a moment of convergence of trends. professional esports leagues around games like league of legends are growing more popular and more serious; huge numbers of people are tuning into livestreams to watch gamers play (fortnite broke the record)  and going to youtube to get fun game-centric content from game celebrities.  at the same time? physical spaces around the country are being renovated into gamer bars.  those 150 million gamers in america want to gather. they want to sit next to each other  elbow to elbow  controller to controller. they want the lighting to be cool  the snacks to be hot pockets  and they want a full bar because they are not teenagers anymore. it was inevitable. movie theater attendance hit a 25-year low in 2017  while 638 000 tuned in to watch drake play fortnite recently. the paris olympics in 2024 are now in talks to include gaming as a demonstration sport.  besides  gamers already have been playing together  chatting live on headsets and messaging apps as they march through their increasingly beautiful digital worlds. oaklands new esports arena threw a pre-opening party recently. a line stretched down the block. nearly 4 000 people jammed into the former parking structure and onto the street around it  right in the touristy heart of jack london square. the sponsor was cup of noodles. inside it was cacophony. there were game sound effects  hundreds of hands clicking on controllers  bags of chips opening and the periodic shrieks of shoutcasters  who comment on game play for live streams that tens of thousands watch. tyler endres  the co-founder of esports arena  said he had to speak at four community meetings to convince the community it would  in fact  like an esports arena. they wanted a grocery store  mr. endres said  grimacing. and yes  the arena had trouble getting a liquor license. the thought was  theyre 13-year-olds  theyre not drinking  said jud hannigan  36  who is the chief executive of allied esports  an investor in esports arena. but the average age is 25. it was a big industrial-looking space with a raised floor to hide the warren of cables  designed flexibly for big stage games or for nights when more people would play. tonight was a bit of both  with more than a hundred tvs and computers set up with different games.  on the glowing stage  two of the best from the scrum went head-to-head  as the audience cheered and shoutcasters on high presenter chairs narrated the play-by-play. a smoke machine blew over the whole scene. landon trybuch  a 24-year old from vancouver  british columbia  said it was nice to be out from the sweaty back rooms of video stores where he used to play. its amazing  he said  holding his own controller. its cord had been covered in yarn by his girlfriend. theres so much room. six people ran a production studio in back  getting the game streamed live  audio  lighting  graphics  live cutting and instant replays. herb press  77  who designed the space  watched from the restaurant a few steps above the fray. this was his first esports arena  and he was not sure what to expect from the patrons. this is an audience involved in this particular time in the computer age  but im amazed how critical they are  he said. they do have serious concepts and tastes. i heard one come out of the bathroom and say it looked cool in there. mr. press is excited about seattle  where he is working to transform a registered historic building  the four-story union stables  into an esports arena. one recent afternoon in the hollywood hills  the guys were tired  but the creative director needed more fortnite content  and so the break dancers kept going.  the guys were faze clan  an esports organization. their job is to be cool gamers. they stream game play  and they make highly shareable videos about video games. this workday goal is to leave with three to four pieces of viral-ready content. so theyd keep filming guess this dance move videos.  faze is one of several growing esports teams and content mills. the faze clan  probably the largest pop gaming brand  has houses in california (calabasas and hollywood) and texas (austin). fans often show up outside and try to come in  and vera salamone  the director of talent  is most alarmed by the fact that their parents are driving them there. the make-a-wish kids came over a couple weeks ago  and all they wanted to do was play fortnite  said ms. salamone  who used to be on kid rocks management team and wears a diamond on one of her teeth. she worries about what happens to the boys  the talent in the clan are all boys  as they grow up. they all have distinct personalities  ms. salamone said of the faze gamers. jev screams all the time. jimmy jellinek  chief creative officer of faze clan and previously chief content officer at playboy  said: jev will do a top 5 clip of amateur footage and then rage over the microphone  and those do extraordinarily well.  thomas oliveira  24  who streams under the name temperrr  took me down to his suite  where barry the bengal cat lives and where mr. oliveira streams fortnite on twitch and posts videos to his 1.6 million youtube followers. he joined the collective when he was 15  playing call of duty when the clan was a handful of snipers. he went to school for business and was not even a full semester in when he stood up during a math test and walked out.  by 2012  the group decided to start professional gaming teams to

wework at hollywood and vine  where that new gamer management company is taking shape. lee trink  50  an owner of faze clan  has a desk that is almost entirely empty except for a crossbow. his last gig was president of capitol records. now  he says  esports and gaming are the future and will eclipse movies. the industry is asleep at the switch  he said. for people my age and older who control a lot of the zeitgeist  the vibe is still gamers must be nerds in their parents basement. he wore an unbuttoned chambray shirt over a tight white t-shirt  airpods on a belt harness  and metal and leather bracelets. he is not alone in his thinking about the industry. peter guber  the chief executive of the mandalay entertainment group  and ted leonsis  the majority owner of monumental sports & entertainment  bought a clan called team liquid recently. (weve won $19 million in prize money so far  said mike milanov  the chief operating officer of team liquid  which recently opened an 8 000 square foot esports team training facility in santa monica.) the experience of games is so rich  so deep  they deliver on the promise  whereas films have increasingly not delivered on the promise  mr. trink said. were creating a business thats filling a void people dont even know is a void yet. he sees streaming gamers as a fully new genre of mainstream entertainment. and like every generation of entertainment before  theyll need their own palaces. gamers are coming together for practical reasons as well as social ones. games are so sophisticated that they can overload home connections. and cryptocurrency miners have driven the price of crucial gear  like the graphics card gamers use to amp up their computers processing speeds. were seeing the rebirth of social gaming  luigino gigante  27  who opened a gaming center called waypoint cafe on the lower east side of new york late last year. its bringing back the community aspect of gaming again. its like  o.k.  were still playing separately  but were together. and theres an underused asset already at hand.  the movie theater! said ann hand  the c.e.o. of super league gaming  which converts movie theaters into esports arenas  and has raised $32 million from investors. it has that thunderous sound  and its empty a lot of the time. two days a week  ms. hand and her crews convert about 50 movie auditoriums into esports arenas  where kids  mostly younger  compete and watch the game projected onto the big screen. for the super league gamers  the events can accompany or replace traditional sports. its a new little league and minor league for todays athletes. each city plays together as a branded team  theres the chicago force  the new york fury  the san francisco ionics. so far  there are 50 000 players. parents accompany younger players  and the real-life experience opens their eyes. the most common piece of feedback was that they knew their son or daughter loved this game  but they had no way to understand the game or know if they were any good at it  ms. hand said. like  i didnt know my son or daughter was that competitive. by 2019  she expects to be in 500 venues. nellie bowles covers tech and internet culture. follow her on twitter:@nelliebowles advertisement    collapse see my options

(disney is expected in the coming week to increase ticket prices again  particularly for peak vacation times  as a way to spread out attendance.) disney cruise line also had a strong quarter. advertisement analysts  however  were focused on disneys various growth plans during a post-earnings conference call  peppering robert a. iger  disneys chief executive  with questions about the companys $52.4 billion offer for 21st century fox assets last month. he had few specific answers. advertisement we dont really have any update on the regulatory front  mr. iger said  adding that he intends to be patient as antitrust officials scrutinize the acquisition. mr. iger did say that he had met with several fox executives in recent weeks  gaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations. when the conversation turned to espn plus  disneys sports streaming service  mr. iger emphasized that users would be able to personalize their experience. espn plus will exist inside the espn app  which is being rebuilt. the changes will be dramatic  mr. iger said. he made no mention about the future management of espn  which has been operating under temporary leadership after the surprise resignation of john skipper  who stepped down as president last month  citing substance addiction.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mr. iger also focused on disneys film pipeline  announcing that david benioff and d.b. weiss  executive producers of hbos hit series game of thrones  would write and produce a series of new star wars movies. for the first time  mr. iger noted  disney will release three marvel movies in a single year  starting with black panther  which is poised for a blockbuster arrival on feb. 16  followed by avengers: infinity war in may and ant-man and the wasp in july. for its first fiscal quarter  which ended on dec. 30  disney had net income of $4.42 billion  or $2.91 a share  compared with $2.48 billion  or $1.55 a share  a year earlier. most of the increase was attributable to a $1.6 billion one-time tax benefit associated with the rewrite of the federal tax code. excluding the tax benefit  disney had per-share results for the quarter of $1.89. revenue totaled $15.35 billion  a 4 percent increase. analysts had predicted per-share profit of $1.61 and revenue of $15.45 billion. disney shares increased about 3 percent in after-hours trading  to $109.28. the companys vast television division  disney media networks  has been buffeted by subscriber declines at espn  a problem that continued during the quarter as more people cut cable and relied on streaming services like hulu  netflix and amazon prime. advertising revenue at espn also dropped; disney cited a timing shift in college football playoff games as one reason. lackluster ratings at disney-owned abc also caused headaches for disney media networks  which reported a 12 percent decline in operating income  to $1.19 billion. disneys movie studio had operating income of $829 million  down 2 percent from a year earlier. box office successes in the quarter included thor: ragnarok  which collected $852.7 million worldwide (26 percent more than doctor strange took in a year earlier). but walt disney studios suffered from weaker home entertainment results  cars 3 did not sell as well on dvd as finding dory did a year earlier. the companys smallest division  disney consumer products and interactive media  which is run by james pitaro  who is considered a candidate to lead espn  reported a 4 percent decline in operating income. revenue related to video games increased  disney said  but not enough to offset setbacks including lower licensing revenue from merchandise based on frozen. an earlier version of this article misstated the price of disneys shares following after-hours trading. the price was $109.28  not $106.17. a version of this article appears in print on february 7  2018  on page b7 of the new york edition with the headline: for disney  pursuing stronger growth but taking some punches along the way.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

movies,advertisement by reggie ugwufeb. 12  2018  for all its sci-fi sparkle and requisite fate-of-the-world stakes  the most salient aspects of marvel studios black panther may be the most basic: it is the first major superhero movie with an african protagonist; the first to star a majority black cast; and in ryan coogler (creed  fruitvale station)  the first to employ a black writer and director. those distinctions may add up to a public relations victory for the blockbuster factory responsible for the avengers and the rest of the $13 billion marvel cinematic universe  but its a mixed one  to count the films racial milestones is to acknowledge the homogeneity of its predecessors. (there have been 17  since were counting.) as often happened in the comic books  however  the house that iron man built can ably dismantle the very norms it once codified. and in that sense  black panther may punctuate an emerging trend. it follows the mold-breaking work of james gunns stylish guardians of the galaxy movies and taika waititis self-aware thor: ragnarok  suggesting  after 10 years of tony stark  that marvels tolerance for risk might be growing along with its financial clout. [get recommendations on tv shows and films to stream from watching.] black panther is also  of course  a shrewd bet on the social and economic muscle of black filmgoers. mr. cooglers film  based on an unsung 1960s creation of stan lee and jack kirby  has inspired a level of anticipation that wildly exceeds the name recognition of its title character  owing  in part  to pent-up demand for a megabudget movie devoted to black life. advertisement as with wonder woman last year  another movie that spoke to an underserved population at a moment of acute political anxiety  audiences have reacted with partisan fervor. the best of what to watch and where to watch it  delivered to your inbox twice a week. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. black panther is already a phenomenon on social media  where eager fans are teasing their opening-night outfits  ruminating on race and representation with the hashtag #whatblackpanthermeanstome and showing their support for the #blackpantherchallenge (a spontaneous campaign to buy tickets and popcorn for children). the film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter  according to the online vendor fandango  surpassing the hunger games and the 2017 live-action remake of beauty and the beast. the morning after a red-carpet premiere in hollywood last month that left twitter swooning  the stars  director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the african diaspora on screen. advertisement taking part in the discussion were mr. coogler; chadwick boseman  who plays tchalla  a.k.a. black panther  king of the fictional african nation of wakanda; lupita nyongo (nakia  a wakandan spy and tchallas love interest); michael b. jordan (erik killmonger  an african-american adversary of black panthers); danai gurira (okoye  wakandas greatest warrior); and kevin feige  a producer of black panther and president of marvel studios. these are edited excerpts from the conversation. i read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations. [rolling laughter] chadwick boseman i still want my reparations! i still want my reparations! ryan coogler [laughing] i think only reparations can be reparations. its silly  but is there a kernel of truth there for any of you? the idea that disney and marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution? danai gurira what it does in such a beautiful way  to me  is it sets a precedent. weve read a lot of subtitles for german and russian  we can read subtitles for african languages now. people cant go back and say  no  thats going to be too hard  its africa. they cant do that. and that is so thrilling to me. michael b. jordan it couldnt have been done on a bigger level. if marvel is behind it  then its gotta be o.k. moving forward  everybodys going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didnt think were lucrative  didnt think that anybody wanted to see. all of that  i feel  is getting ready to dissolve. boseman it has to. gurira no  it will. coogler what ill say is  this is my second time working in the studio system  and they say its the studio system  but its really the people system. its whos running the studio? how are they running it? when you look at disney with [tendo nagenda  executive vice president for production at walt disney studios  and nate moore  a producer at marvel studios and an executive producer of black panther]  its a place thats interested in representation  not just for the sake of representation  but representation because thats what works  thats whats going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace  thats what leads to success. kevin  theres long been this idea in hollywood that movies with black casts dont perform well internationally. does that end with black panther? kevin feige i certainly hope so. one thing i would always remind ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. and i think hes delivered a movie thats going to do that  and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested. advertisement for the actors  what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies youve done? boseman ive done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past  but this not only refers to the past  it sets the stage for where were going. gurira ive had a passion for telling african stories for a really long time  being american-born and zimbabwe-raised. that biculturalism is something that i try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama eclipsed was nominated for a tony for best play]  but nothing can address it like a marvel movie. i had a childlike glee after my meeting with ryan  i kind of floated around  found my car somehow. you think youre alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think  oh wow  were all in it together? and yall are doing this already? and i just have to be in it? it was just so beautiful. lupita nyongo seeing it yesterday  im even more excited about the celebration of pan-africanism  because this movie is really about a contemporary africa relating very intimately with a contemporary america via the characters of black panther and killmonger. were talking about some really deep issues that we dont often voice but we all feel. [ms. nyongo was born in mexico to kenyan parents and raised in kenya.] boseman a lot of times  being [a black man] in hollywood  when you get material youll read it and youll be like  thats not us. when i got the initial call from kevin feige  my hope was that they would have the courage to give black panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be. and they did that. on set  did you have that feeling of this is important or did you just try to do good work like normal?  coogler i learned a skill from playing football. i was a wide receiver  they throw you the ball  you cant drop it. so i learned that you gotta tune everything else out. if i get to set and theres a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and lupita is dressed in this adornment and danai is dressed in this adornment and theyre like  hey ryan  do i stand here or here? i cant think  ah  this is amazing  im making black panther and theres all these black folks on screen! i really gotta tell danai that she needs to move over here  and i gotta tell her five reasons why shes gotta move over here  because shes gonna wanna know em! [laughter] advertisement but seriously  i grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. if i really thought about the fact that im making one of these things right now  with people i know and love  i would break down emotionally. i wouldnt be no good to anybody. nyongo a moment when i really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. there were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming  and between takes  the drummers started riffing to [snoop doggs] drop it like its hot. the whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as ryan figured things out below. in that moment  i was like  this is big. i had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and i could feel a vibration in the air. we all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history. michael  one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from killmongers identity as an african-american  which contrasts against tchallas african-ness. what did you want to bring to the character? jordan ryan [and i] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality  his outlook  his rage  his agenda. we felt like we could show where erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry  why he is so lost. he doesnt know who he is  but he knows the answers are out there. boseman for me  [killmonger and tchalla] are two sides of the same coin  african and african-american. as an african-american  if youre disconnected from your ancestry and your past  you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that. coogler the fracture that killmonger has  thats the fracture i lived with my whole life. im from a place that id never been to and that nobody who i loved had been to because they couldnt afford to go [to africa. mr. coogler grew up in richmond in northern california]. so i would hear stories from them about this place that they didnt even know anything about  and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them. in the movie  wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world  and white people who arent in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. thats a very real view that a lot of people hold about africa  as recent comments attributed to the president made clear. what do you hope will be the effect of introducing audiences to this counternarrative about the continent? advertisement coogler the narrative about the continent that we know is actually a fairly recent narrative  if you think about human history. its a narrative that was born out of what happened when the countries of africa were conquered. but the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters  and these recent comments definitely arent the first time somebody has said something like that  were the cradle of civilization. they were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized. all the structures that we built in wakanda  theyre taller structures of what youll find in africa. some of them we switched up  instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium  but those are buildings that youll really find in mali  in ethiopia  in nigeria. i spent about three weeks in africa [doing research for black panther] and i truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being. that experience made me not only capable [of writing] this film  but it made me whole as a person. a version of this article appears in print on february 18  2018  on page ar12 of the new york edition with the headline: a superhero of the diaspora.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

movies,why the linchpin of marvels avengers movies  and walking image of american fortitude  is giving it all up to play a villain on broadway (and learn to tap dance). by reggie ugwumarch 22  2018  chris evans has a theory about tap dancing. tap is waiting to have its day  he said one recent afternoon  sitting in a tribeca hotel clubhouse around the corner from an apartment hes been renting since last month. mr. evans  or captain america  as hes been known in omnipresent marvel movies for the better part of a decade  tapped as a child and still has sincere reverence for the form. his theory is that tap dancing today  like competitive hip-hop dancing in the early 2000s  is generally undervalued and ripe for a comeback. if you walk down the street and you see someone tapping  you stop in your tracks  he said  using an unprintable word  because its awesome. twice a week since hes been living in new york  mr. evans  who ordinarily splits his time between his native boston and los angeles  has taken refuge in tap  clearing his mind and working up a sweat in private lessons taught by a friend. the lessons arent preparation for any role in particular  although mr. evans is hard at work on a pivotal one: his broadway debut  as a charming but manipulative cop in kenneth lonergans lobby hero  which is now in previews and opens march 26 at the helen hayes theater. the dancing  rather  is just a low-pressure new hobby (it makes me feel like im a part of the music  mr. evans said.) along with the play  and the move to a new city  its one component in an ad hoc but inevitable process  not quite a rebirth  more like a re-orientation  designed to help the 36-year-old actor answer a nagging question: what do you do with your life after walking away from the role of a lifetime? advertisement since 2011  the year captain america: the first avenger was released  mr. evanss face (and torso  and biceps) has signified a marketable mix of principled strength and rank-and-file virtue as reliably as any in hollywood. he was a working-class revolutionary in the dystopic thriller snowpiercer  a stoic defender of the public school system in the indie family drama gifted  a cunning spy who risks everything to save a persecuted minority in the soon-to-be-released the red sea diving resort. and then there are the avengers movies  in which the nobility of mr. evanss character is so unimpeachable that entire plotlines turn on the ticks of his moral compass. in the tribeca lounge  mr. evans volunteered his own stereotype: taciturn men who are leaders  selfless and magnanimous. last year  he filmed back-to-back the final two marvel movies for which he is under contract  avengers: infinity war  due in april  and a sequel planned for next year. for now  he has no plans to return to the franchise (you want to get off the train before they push you off  he said)  and expects that planned reshoots in the fall will mark the end of his tenure in the familiar red  white and blue super suit. advertisement it was in the midst of shooting infinity war that mr. evans signed on for lobby hero. also starring michael cera  brian tyree henry and bel powley  it inaugurates the nonprofit second stage theaters recently remodeled broadway venue. the choice will give those wondering about mr. evanss frame of mind plenty to chew on: his character  known only as bill  is essentially a narcissistic creep  with a vision of protecting the innocent that lifts a warped mirror to the actors usual procession of do-gooders. the plays director  trip cullman  sent the script to mr. evans betting that the potential to subvert his image would be too enticing to pass up. i had this inkling that he may not have had the opportunity to show what he can really do as an actor  mr. cullman said. a lot of actors are afraid to play someone unlikable  but i think he really has an egoless desire to serve the work. though lobby hero is his broadway debut  mr. evans is not a total stranger to the theater. he grew up in sudbury  mass.  outside of boston  in a family of performers: his mother was a dancer who later ran a childrens theater  his elder sister carly studied drama at new york university and his younger brother scott is a television actor who recently appeared on the netflix comedy grace and frankie. in high school  mr. evans balanced wrestling and lacrosse practice with shakespeare  and was voted most theatrical after appearing in a midsummer nights dream and the winters tale. the summer before his senior year  he moved to new york to intern for a casting company and went back to sudbury with his first agent. by graduation  hed landed a role on television  as one of three boys in a former all-girls school on the short-lived fox drama opposite sex. he spent the next several years playing a series of clean-cut hunks with an ambivalent relationship to their shirts: there was the shirtless jock in not another teen movie  the shirtless musician in whats your number? and the shirtless flame-throwing superhero in two fantastic four movies  which put him in marvels orbit. in conversation  mr. evans is more thoughtful and grounded than his filmography might suggest. he is animated by the challenge of playing against type  but has no regrets over his previous roles and surprisingly little anxiety about future prospects. i used to have thoughts of wanting to climb to the top of something  or wanting to be somebody  he said. but when you get the thing that you think you want and then you wake up and realize that you still have pockets of sadness  and that your struggle will reinvent itself  you stop chasing after those things and its liberating  because you realize that right here  right now  is exactly all i need. advertisement mr. evans was wearing the urban camouflage of a black nasa baseball cap with a cuffed brim pulled low. at around 6 feet tall  he is much less physically imposing in person than he appears onscreen  with the unassuming athleticism of the friend you forget does crossfit until beach season comes around. for the play  he recently grew a formidable mustache  a mighty rust-flecked horseshoe  and gained a super power of a different sort. people dont recognize me at all  he said. i can look them right in the eye  its like im invisible. lobby hero  which ran off broadway in 2001  follows several nights in the lives of four workers on the graveyard shift who are stratified by professional and social class. a pair of male security guards  one black and one white  have a series of run-ins with a swaggering cop and his young female partner in the lobby of a nondescript manhattan apartment building. a queasy drama  replete with abuses of power and sexual coercion  unfolds between the male officer  played by mr. evans  and his partner dawn (ms. powley). in the #metoo era  when sensitivities to the plight of women in male-dominated institutions are especially raw  mr. evanss scenes add live wires to the plays emotional and political circuitry. in an interview  mr. lonergan  the playwright  dismissed the notion that he had been prescient 17 years ago. (he has since gone on to a successful film career  writing and directing manchester by the sea most recently.) the plays fresh resonance  he said  was an indictment of how little has changed in society. this isnt new  mr. lonergan said. anyone whos shocked by these issues  i dont know where theyve been.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mr. cullman  the director  said he hoped lobby hero would further expose toxic masculinity. kenny has given voice to dawns predicament in such a compassionate and powerful way  he said. mr. evanss newfound appetite for morally challenged characters has already been tested by broadways eight-show-a-week routine. two weeks into previews for lobby hero  he said it had felt more like two months. advertisement but hes prepared for the part with the fervor of the newly indoctrinated. mr. evanss character is charismatic and often funny  and the actor devoted much of his rehearsal time to exploring how a man who is well liked can shade into reprehensible. he has the right instrument to bring the character to life  said mr. cera  who worked with mr. evans on the 2010 film scott pilgrim vs. the world. mr. cera pointed to one scene in which bill threatens his partner. the words on the page are menacing  but chris made the choice to deliver them as if he himself is spinning out  which is much more frightening  he said. it reduced bel to tears one night because it was so unexpected. the role has unexpectedly submerged mr. evans in questions of gender inequality and the distribution of power just as those same questions are roiling his industry. the actor  who said he didnt base his performance on anyone in particular (its awful to admit  but i know plenty of guys who fit this mold)  has been studying how to better conduct himself as an ally to women in his profession. one book he found eye-opening was rebecca solnits the mother of all questions. mr. evans read it while dating the actress jenny slate (their on-again  off-again relationship  beloved by the internet  recently ended) and decided that he needed to listen more and speak less. the hardest thing to reconcile is that just because you have good intentions  doesnt mean its your time to have a voice  he said. as has become the norm for star-driven plays on broadway  lobby hero has a limited run  through may 13. and while the show is as substantial a leap as any mr. evans has made professionally  it remains a kind of riff on his existing rsum. when its over  hell discover what it really means to be a film actor with captain americas face (and bank account)  but without the job. advertisement the last time he experienced anything similar was in 2016  when he took a year off from acting after wrapping the third captain america film. mr. evans spent the time remodeling his house in boston and bonding with his family. he visited his mother or sister every other day and marked the seasons with his nieces and nephews  apple picking  pumpkin carving  decorating a christmas tree. he raised an adopted puppy  a regal mixed breed named dodger  and became a regular at his local grocery store. mr. evans said it was those slice-of-life domestic moments  rather than notions of any particular career path  that have most influenced his vision board. when i think about the times that im happiest  its not on a movie set  he said  adding that he no longer wishes to make more than one film per year. ive stopped thinking about my trajectory  or my oeuvre  or whatever pretentious word you want to use. im just following whatever i feel creatively hungry for. he wants to direct (his directorial debut before we go screened at the toronto international film festival in 2014) and to start a family of his own. and  when hes had his fill of tap dancing  he envisions many more hobbies  including sculpting and carpentry. im not afraid to take my foot off the gas  he said. if someone said tomorrow  youre done  you cant do anything else  id be o.k. a version of this article appears in print on march 25  2018  on page ar7 of the new york edition with the headline: from captain america to broadway.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

"this is what white people get to feel like all the time?!!!!" #allthetime can somebody get this video to ryan coogler  @chadwickboseman @michaelb4jordan @lupita_nyongo @imangelabassett @danaigurira and this dope ass cast & team so we can say thank you personally?forreal tho pic.twitter.com/dqojxxuoab  what has audiences so eager this time is in part the combination of an auteur african-american director (ryan coogler of fruitvale station and creed)  a heavyweight cast (chadwick boseman  michael b. jordan  lupita nyongo  angela bassett and forest whitaker) and a soundtrack co-produced by a rap superstar (kendrick lamar)  all working on one of the most popular franchises in hollywood. but the excitement has also been fueled by the origin story of the african superhero. advertisement created by stan lee and jack kirby  black panther was the first black superhero in mainstream comics  making his debut in marvels fantastic four no. 52 in 1966. he went on to appear in avengers titles and took his first star turn in jungle action no. 5 in 1973. he had his ups and downs: his own series largely penned by kirby  a cancellation in 1979 and a return in the 1980s. from 2005 to 2009  he was the subject of another series  this one written by the filmmaker reginald hudlin (marshall). in 2016  ta-nehisi coates wrote a new series of comic books  while joe robert cole and mr. coogler worked on the script. advertisement in many ways  black panther is part of a current wave of black superheroes  like netflixs luke cage and cws black lightning. but black panther has the setting of wakanda  a fictional african country that is wealthy (thanks to vibranium  a mineral with energy-manipulating qualities) and technologically advanced. part of the movies emotional and visual appeal lies in the fact that wakanda has never been colonized. a preview of the film. wakanda is a kind of black utopia in our fight against colonialism and imperial control of black land and black people by white people  said deirdre hollman  a founder of the annual black comic book festival at the schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem. to the black imagination  that means everything. in a comic book  it is a reality  and through a major motion picture  its even more tangibly and artistically a reality that we can explore for ourselves. theres so much power thats drawn from the notion that there was a community  a nation that resisted colonization and infiltration and subjugation. join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of new york times journalists. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. for frederick joseph  a marketing consultant who created the #blackpantherchallenge  a gofundme campaign to buy tickets so youngsters can see black panther in theaters  the complexity of wakanda takes on new meaning in our current moment. compared with president trumps disparagement of haiti and african nations  he said  you have wakanda as a place of afro-futurism  of what african nations can be or what they could have been and still be had colonialism not taken place. (mr. josephs campaign  which raised more than $40 000 to take children from the boys & girls club of harlem to the film  has led to more than 70 similar efforts.) the black panthers regal alter ego  prince tchalla  is a draw as well  said jonathan gray  author of the forthcoming illustrating the race: representing blackness in american comics. he explained: now there you have every black boys fantasy. he is richer than bill gates  smarter than elon musk  better looking than denzel. and with vibranium  he is the hereditary ruler of the richest nation on earth. the movie is about wish fulfillment. when you see bruce wayne  this dashing billionaire  where is the black version of that? you got tchalla. in this sense  black panther is as much an alternative to our contemporary racial discourse as it is a throwback  not only a desire for what could have been but also a nostalgia for what we once had. i dont think its a coincidence that this movie appears precisely in a moment in which our politics seems inescapable  mr. gray said  adding later that black panther should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of the obama era have been undermined. for marc bernardin  an author of the comic book genius and host of the podcast fatman on batman with the director kevin smith  the movie taps into the cultural longing for what obama was  the time in which you didnt check your phone every day hoping the world wasnt on fire again. a time where devaluation of young black life wasnt as stark and awful as it feels like it is right now. simply going to the movie can be interpreted as a small gesture of protest and a grand expression of cultural pride. advertisement black panther has already become a kind of shared language. last week i was at the mall when another black dude passed by me  mr. bernardin said. we gave each other a nod  and he said  black panthers in a month  yo. that was his version of whats up  his way of marking of time. in addition to fans wearing custom-made black panther costumes and african-inspired haute couture to the premiere last month  african-american civic groups and others are buying out movie theaters so african-american children can experience the film with one another. in oakland  calif.  ladawn james williams originally intended to fly to new york to see it with her college friends from howard university. instead she plans to host a black panther screening for her local chapter of jack and jill of america. she  her husband  and their 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son will watch it with more than 90 other african-american families in a private viewing. well be able to take the mask off  she said. its going to be really subtle  but were going to get certain things about the movie and its language that only we know. so i want this to be something we do together: my family  my chapter and my community. a version of this article appears in print on february 11  2018  on page ar12 of the new york edition with the headline: black panther brings hype and pride.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
movies,advertisement  encounters  by                       stuart emmrich   dec. 1  2017  the actor sebastian stan sat at a window table in the sea grill restaurant on a recent tuesday afternoon  overlooking the skating rink at rockefeller center. we used to come into the city a lot when i was a kid  said mr. stan  35  recalling the years when he lived with his mother and stepfather in nyack  n.y.  and was a student at rockland country day school. especially around the holidays  this was the best place to come. as he spoke and glanced quickly at the lunch menu  deciding on salmon tartare and sparkling water  a steady stream of nervous-looking skaters passed by  several tumbling to the ice. at one point  a young girl  swaddled in a bright-pink winter coat  stopped in front of the restaurant window  tightly gripped the railing and burst into tears as her mother gently  and unsuccessfully  tried to lure her back to the ice mr. stan was asked if he had skated here. ive never been ice skating  ever  he said. im traumatized by the idea of it. look  see those kids out there  falling. i keep thinking that im going to fall  and then someone is going to come by and slash my wrists off with one of their blades. so im much happier on the sidelines  as a spectator. its a surprising admission from someone whose new film  i  tonya  opening later this month  is all about the world of ice skating  in particular  the 1994 winter olympics  the toxic rivalry between nancy kerrigan and tonya harding  and the famous kneecapping incident that sent ms. kerrigan to the floor  screaming  why  why  why? advertisement mr. stan  perhaps best known to film audiences as bucky barnes (a.k.a. the winter soldier) in marvels captain america films and the coming avengers: infinity war  plays jeff gillooly  ms. hardings husband at the time and one of the bumbling accomplices in the tabloid-ready crime. (in 1994  mr. gillooly was sentenced to two years in jail and fined $100 000 for his role in that incident; he was released in 1995. ms. harding was put on probation for three years and banned for life by the united states skating association.) advertisement it is not a particularly sympathetic role. in fact  mr. stan  in character as mr. gillooly  is introduced to the films viewers in an early scene in which he looks directly into the camera and says: at 27 i was the most hated man in america. maybe the world  with a mustache i still cant apologize enough for. my name was a verb. like  if you bash someone in the kneecap  you gillooly them. (margot robbie plays tonya in the oscar-buzzy movie  which was directed by craig gillespie.) was there any trepidation about taking on the role of this somewhat unsavory character  one who is not only a comically inept criminal but is also part of a mutually abusive relationship that the film portrays unflinchingly? ive gotten really good at not judging characters  mr. stan said. you have that fear of god  i dont know if i can do this. but the script was intriguing. and regardless of what i thought happened  and what judgments i had about all that  i just had to let it go  and trust the script. my job as an actor is to just tell the story as best i can  from my characters point of view  and let the audience decide. there was  however  one person who was puzzled that mr. stan had taken this role: mr. gillooly. shortly before filming began earlier this year  the two met at a restaurant in portland  ore.  where mr. gillooly and ms. harding first met and where mr. gillooly still lives. as mr. stan recalled  the first thing jeff said to me  when i sat down  was  why would anyone want to do this? who would want to see this thing? mr. stans answer? i told him it was a really great script. mr. stan had spent the previous couple of months obsessively researching mr. gillooly  finding on youtube a television interview that mr. gillooly had given several years ago  and also listening to the audiotape of a three-hour interview mr. gillooly had given to steven rogers  the films screenwriter. steve sent me that tape and i walked around the city over the holidays  listening to jeffs voice over and over and over again  he said. when the two finally met  mr. stan wasnt particularly interested in probing for more details about the kerrigan incident  or hearing mr. gilloolys side of the story. instead  he was looking for biographical details that would help him find his character. there was an earlier jeff in the script that i couldnt find anything on  mr. stan said. how was he when he was in high school? who was he back then? what did he want to be? how did he smile? when he got excited  how did he move his hands? advertisement but he said the face-to-face meeting was a bit unnerving: i had spent so much time listening to him  and watching him  and now here he was in person. its almost like you are doing a double take. the lifestyle newsletter from the styles  travel and food sections  offering the latest trends to news you can use. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. next up for mr. stan is destroyer  by the director karyn kusama  also starring nicole kidman and tatiana maslany  which he begins filming in january. he has also become something of a fashion world favorite (perhaps a result of him having played a memorably shirtless drifter in the 2013 broadway revival of picnic). he has been invited to the public school shows  accompanied todd snyder to the cfda awards and was profiled in a gq style fashion shoot. on this afternoon  he was wearing a black iro coat  a dark green theory t-shirt  black a gold e jeans and weathered frye boots that he said were taken from the set of the avengers movie. though born in romania and raised by a single mother in vienna before she married an american and the family moved to rockland county  n.y.  mr. stan considers himself a new yorker. his first apartment after graduating from the mason gross school of the arts at rutgers university in 2005 was a two-bedroom on a grim stretch of west 42nd street opposite the port authority. (my share was just $800 a month! he said  almost in wonder.) and he has never left the city since  moving to several different neighborhoods before settling down in his current apartment in soho. he was headed there after the lunch at the sea grill  and as he began to gather up his things  he looked out one last time at the rink. at that moment  a middle-aged man in a canada goose parka came whizzing by  a look of panic on his face  and then crashed  spread-eagled. said mr. stan: thats exactly why i am not on the ice today. an earlier version of this article quoted incorrectly the figure skater nancy kerrigan. after she was attacked at a detroit ice rink  she screamed  why  why  why? not why me? continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on facebook (styles and modern love)  twitter (styles  fashion and weddings) and instagram. a version of this article appears in print on december 3  2017  on page st12 of the new york edition with the headline: actor in film about skating attack is wary of the ice.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

movies,advertisement supported by by brooks barnes and tiffany hsu the walt disney company is set to become the proud owner of a vast swath of rupert murdochs movie and television empire  having agreed to pay $52.4 billion to acquire most of 21st century fox  the companies said on thursday.  the enormous deal is the latest move toward consolidation in hollywood.  whats in it for disney?  foxs television division is one of the most prolific content producers in the business. shows include the simpsons  this is us  modern family  american horror story and homeland.  the (comparatively small) equivalent at disney is abc studios  which has recently struggled to produce hits. in august  it lost its biggest hitmaker  shonda rhimes  who created greys anatomy and scandal  to netflix.  streaming is a market that disney plans to break into in a big way. this year  the company announced two coming services: one  powered by sports programming from espn  set to begin next year and another  scheduled for 2019  to be built around movies and tv shows. disney hopes that the fox television juggernaut can supercharge its ambitions by producing original series for the services and providing access to a catalog of older offerings. fox would also contribute its stake in hulu  the streaming service that shows abc content and original programming like the handmaids tale  giving disney a majority share. in the 1990s  when marvel was just starting out as a movie company  a licensing agreement gave control of the x-men and fantastic four franchises to fox. disney bought marvel for $4 billion in 2009; the deal with fox brings optioned characters  including the edgy deadpool  back into the marvel fold.  disney  home to frozen  toy story and the avengers  will pick up other film franchises  namely avatar  for which there were four sequels in production as of april. fox also owns the ice age animated series and the rebooted planet of the apes franchise. disney could also decide to take foxs older properties out of retirement  including night at the museum  home alone  doctor dolittle and alvin and the chipmunks. lucasfilm  which spawned the popular star wars films  has belonged to disney since 2012. but fox has retained the distribution rights to the first film  episode iv  a new hope  in perpetuity.  fox will bring its collection of regional sports networks to the table  including the yes network that carries new york yankees games  helping to fortify espn and its streaming service. foxs sports channels often hold exclusive rights to broadcast local professional and college games in the united states. the channels also have deals with teams from major league baseball  the national basketball association and the national hockey league.  that has proved lucrative for the company  drawing advertising revenue. espn has struggled this year  with 1.4 million cable subscribers abandoning its flagship channel  taking away tens of millions of dollars in revenue. the network has tried to attract more local viewership and to re-engage fans lost to video clips on their mobile devices.  disney is already a global behemoth  with major operations in europe  japan and china  where it opened its shanghai disney resort last year.  but the company gets a lopsided amount of its profit from north america. mr. murdoch got his start in australia  new zealand and britain and has developed a stable of international businesses  some of which will now be disneys.  that includes sky  the largest media company in europe  in which fox holds a nearly 40 percent stake; the national geographic cable channel  which reaches hundreds of millions of homes overseas and has fox as a majority owner; and star india  a sizable indian media company that is a subsidiary of fox.  the deal could also bring diversity to disney  where every business division is run by a man. fox has a sizable roster of female executives. the list includes stacey snider  the head of 20th century fox; emma watts  the vice chair; dana walden  who leads fox television group; nancy utley  the president of fox searchlight pictures; and courteney monroe  the chief executive of national geographic channel. brooks barnes is a media and entertainment reporter  covering all things hollywood. he joined the times in 2007 as a business reporter focused primarily on the walt disney company. he previously worked for the wall street journal.@brooksbarnesnyt advertisement    collapse see my options 
movies,advertisement by bruce frettsoct. 8  2017  you cant keep a good superman down. that seems to be the message of the new trailer for justice league. it opens with a shot of henry cavills man of steel  who sacrificed his life last year in batman v. superman: dawn of justice  appearing in a dream to his love interest  lois lane (amy adams). later  after scenes of apocalyptic destruction and attacks by winged creatures  batman (ben affleck) growls of his former foe: the world needs superman. but does the world need justice league? the superhero conglomerate was traditionally called the justice league of america  but warner bros. opted to drop the last part  perhaps in an attempt to appeal to a global audience. the filmmakers also hope to broaden their reach by striking a more lighthearted tone after critics derided batman v. superman for its humorlessness. sounding like a superfan at new york comic con  the flash (ezra miller) geeks out over the sight of the bat signal: thats so cool! the jokey vibe may also reflect the contribution of joss whedon (buffy the vampire slayer  the avengers)  who stepped in to finish justice league after the co-writer and director zack snyder left the project for personal reasons in may. the teaser features plenty of footage of gal gadots wonder woman  whose stand-alone movie released in the summer has grossed more than $400 million in the united states alone. as cyborg (ray fisher) tells aquaman (jason momoa) after saving his life in the new movie  the ride aint over yet. fans will find out if that holds true for the franchise when justice league hits theaters on nov. 17. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by peter suderman mr. suderman has written about movies for vox.com  national review and other publications. his first publication was on the letters page of amazing spider-man #364 modern hollywood is ruled by franchises  and these days  theres no bigger franchise than the marvel cinematic universe. the release last week of avengers: infinity war marks the 19th film in the superhero series. infinity war is the culmination of 10 years (going back to iron man) of story lines and character arcs  a sprawling finale that is at times exhilarating and exhausting  overlong and underdeveloped  predictable yet also  in its final moments  genuinely shocking. it has been mocked for aspiring to be the most ambitious crossover event in movie history  and although no studio executive appears to have ever said those precise words  the label captures the grandiose spirit of marvels project. its a $300 million superhero opera on a cosmic scale. that an overstuffed picture like this holds together at all is impressive enough. yet messy as it is  infinity war actually works reasonably well. which makes it a fitting quasi-conclusion to a franchise that has been defined not by excellence but by being consistently and reliably pretty good. marvels commitment to pretty good filmmaking has made it enormously successful and helped reshape the business of studio filmmaking. but it has also come at a cost  not only for superhero movies  but for ambitious studio filmmaking writ large. infinity war serves as a capstone to marvels innovative filmmaking strategy  a rigorously honed blend of earnest nostalgia  winking self-referentiality  crossover narratives  appealing heroes and go-for-broke computer-generated spectacle. marvel adapted the idea of a shared fictional world  one in which  say  captain america and black panther exist in the same timeline and might occasionally bump into each other  from its comic book source material  helping to bring the term expanded universe into our common cinematic lexicon. the studio also applied a tv-like sensibility to blockbuster filmmaking  turning the superhero genre into a sort of workplace sitcom with aliens and explosions. its biggest productions have been directed by the creator of buffy the vampire joss whedon and the brothers anthony and joe russo  who previously directed episodes of arrested development and community. the entire franchise is overseen by a single studio executive who essentially serves as a showrunner. the studios core insight was that  with the right intellectual property  the centralized approach to storytelling of both television and comic books  in which each issue or episode is just a component in a long-running serial with an overarching sensibility  could also work for mass audiences on the big screen. this strategy has produced a string of box office hits  an intensely loyal fan base  and even a surprising number of critical successes. it has also become the envy of hollywood  with rival studios racing to create their own expanded universes  but often with mixed results (like last years abysmal justice league). other studios have cloned marvels structural attributes  the pop-culture nostalgia  the serial storytelling  the knowing fan service  but none have managed to replicate the consistency of its product. consider fox  which  somewhat confusingly  owns the rights to the x-men and related marvel superheroes. the x-men films  which predate the marvel universe  have varied far more in both quality and originality than their marvel studios counterparts: no marvel movie has been as bad as the 2015 reboot of fantastic four. but no marvel film has even attempted the elegiac despair of logan or the manic  profane irreverence of deadpool  and its hard to imagine that one ever will. more than anything else  then  marvel has succeeded because it has become a kind of quality guarantee  a brand that represents a workshopped and audience-friendly competence. even the lesser entries among the marvel-universe films are sturdy and watchable. no marvel movie has a rotten tomatoes score of less than 66 percent; the top nine films have all scored 89 or better. in an era where films routinely cost $200 million to produce and just as much to market  this is no small feat for a studio or its viewers. marvels implicit promise is that you can buy a ticket for any of its films and know  with reasonable confidence  that even if the movie isnt great  it is  at the very least  likely to be pretty good. this quality guarantee has given marvel the latitude to take big-budget risks that more conventional studios might balk at  and delivered equally large box office payoffs in return: its hard to imagine that a $230 million production of something as obscure as guardians of the galaxy  with a talking raccoon and living tree in its main cast  could have received a green light without marvels presumption of an audience. and while various producers have attempted to develop a black panther film since at least the 1990s  it was marvel that finally managed to transform it into a mega-budget cinematic reality  and marvels best-reviewed movie. yet black panther also suggests the inherent limitations of marvels model. the movie was directed by ryan coogler  a talented young filmmaker whose two previous films  creed and fruitvale station  demonstrated a remarkable gift for emotional nuance and cinematic lyricism. that gift is still on display in black panther  but in a way that sometimes feels muted and constrained  hemmed in by the broad formulas and expectations of a $200 million superhero movie. mr. coogler stitched together a characteristically impressive single-take action scene in the middle of the film  but the climactic battle in wakanda plays out with the same sort of pixelated weightlessness that is typical of marvel movies. to be clear  black panther is a better-than-average marvel film. but its less a ryan coogler movie made under marvel than a marvel movie made by ryan coogler. given the current state of hollywood blockbusters  one might be forgiven for assuming that a certain amount of poll-tested blandness is necessary in order to achieve mass appeal. but its not  even in the big-budget superhero genre  which in many ways was built on the idiosyncratic personal visions of pop-culture auteurs. in the 1980s and early 90s  tim burtons batman films were recognizably the products of their creators pop-goth freakiness; christopher nolans take on the character two decades later was similarly distinctive (as was dunkirk  a good example of the opportunity cost of big-budget resources and talent getting focused heavily  if not nearly exclusively  on marvel-caliber projects); sam raimis spider-man films clearly sprang from the same zany pulp obsessions that powered darkman and the evil dead films. notably  all of these films were box-office smashes. marvel hasnt totally sanitized its films of directorial personality (the quippy banter of the avengers felt notably whedon-y)  but it has done more to contain and constrain any auteurist impulses in order to maintain a more uniform tone  character  and quality level. but it has also made it difficult to make truly great pictures  the sort that only come about through a combination of luck  inspiration  experimentation and pop-art genius. and that  in turn  has made hollywood less likely to pursue such projects as well. the deeper problem is not so much marvel as its imitators and boosters. as the major studios continue to chase the reliable returns of marvels business model  and critics continue to celebrate marvels merely satisfactory efforts as better than they really are  the likely outcome is that hollywood studios will focus even more of their resources and top-tier talent on the production of movies that are watchable  even enjoyable  but aspire to little else. smaller-budget films and television will fill in some of the gaps  as they already are  but the grandest productions will be reserved for the cautious and competent. i have been a marvel fan from the beginning; i dont expect that to change. and there are worse fates  of course  than a world of adequate  risk-averse blockbusters  of solidly entertaining movies engineered for mass appeal. but there is also something depressing about a vision of the future in which a movie like avengers: infinity war represents the pinnacle of hollywood craftsmanship and creative achievement. as superhero movies and blockbusters go  its pretty good. but i wish that the boldest ambitions of our pop culture overlords were a little more ambitious. peter suderman (@petersuderman) is the managing editor of reason.com. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
movies,advertisement by the associated pressmay 6  2018  1:19 p.m. e.d.t.  los angeles   after breaking opening weekend records  "avengers: infinity war" continued to dominate in its second weekend in theaters  but alternative programming like the romantic comedy "overboard" also found an audience in what has historically been considered the "official" kick-off to the summer movie season. the walt disney co. said sunday that "avengers: infinity war" will gross an estimated $112.5 million from north american theaters over the weekend  becoming the second highest grossing film in weekend two behind "star wars: the force awakens'" $149.2 million and just slightly ahead of "black panther" ($111.7 million). it's a 56 percent drop from its first weekend in theaters  less steep than the second weekend fall of "avengers: age of ultron" (59.4 percent) or "captain america: civil war" (59.5 percent)  but more than "black panther's" uniquely soft 44.7 percent sophomore weekend decline. "we're in uncharted territory again " said comscore senior media analyst paul dergarabedian. "this is a second weekend number that many films would aspire to have on opening weekend." advertisement globally  "avengers: infinity war" has now grossed over $1.2 billion and become the first film ever to cross the $1 billion mark in 11 days of release  and it has yet to even open in china. advertisement there was little new competition this weekend in the blockbuster space  although there were a handful of other options  like "overboard " which came in a very distant second to "avengers " but still made a notable splash for a film its size. mgm and lionsgate's pantelion films' gender-swapped remake of garry marshall's 1987 comedy  "overboard" scored the highest-grossing opening weekend for pantelion films with a better-than-expected $14.8 million from 1 623 theaters. it's already surpassed its modest mid-teens production budget. pantelion films ceo paul presburger and jonathan glickman  president of the motion picture group at mgm  both attribute the success to the star-power of eugenio derbez ("instructions not included " ''how to be a latin lover") who helped developed the bilingual remake with an american star (anna faris) to appeal not just to his hispanic fan base but all audiences. the cast  including derbez and eva longoria  helped promote the film on their social media accounts too. "it's great to have a large base especially in the wake of 'avengers '" presburger said. "we have a movie out there that plays to families and all audiences that should have success into mother's day and onwards." although critics were not especially won over by "overboard " audiences gave the film a more favorable a- cinemascore.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. third place went to "a quiet place " which has grossed $159.9 million in five weeks in theaters  and fourth place to "i feel pretty " now up to $37.8 million in weekend three.

"this was not the strongest weekend ever in terms of the official kick-off of the summer season  but we could be looking at a record may ultimately " dergarabedian said  noting upcoming releases like "deadpool 2" (may 18) and "solo: a star wars story" (may 25).

movies,advertisement by joe coscarellimarch 27  2018  los angeles  for the powerful music manager scooter braun  there were a few mythic figures who proved influential in his formative years. as a child  he was obsessed with superman; later he became an intense devotee of the x-men. but as his eyes began shifting toward moguldom  mr. brauns heroes turned more earthbound. i read a book about my mentor david geffen when i was 19  and he said music was the fastest way in because a song could change your life in a night while film and tv takes years  mr. braun  36  said recently at his casual home office. i actually always wanted to be in film. best known for masterminding the career of a onetime youtube prodigy named justin bieber  mr. braun  who also manages kanye west and ariana grande  has dabbled over the years in the movie business  executive producing the 2014 adaptation of the giver  this years sundance drama burden and several concert documentaries for mr. bieber  among other projects. but mr. braun  as is his tendency  wants bigger. for his next geffen-esque act  he is leaping more fully into film  partnering with david maisel  the founding chairman of marvel studios  to form a new company  mythos studios  which aspires to make its own hit comic-book movie franchises in live-action and animated formats. successes like black panther notwithstanding  the venture comes at a challenging time in the film industry  with ticket sales declining last year and competition from streaming services ratcheting up. advertisement mythos  the pair said in a joint interview  has a well of intellectual property to start from: the company owns a 50 percent stake in aspen comics  the brainchild of the cult illustrator michael turner  who died  in 2008. mythos is currently developing several projects  including adaptations of the aspen comics soulfire and fathom  a best-selling title upon its release in 1998. the studio is also interested in original material  and is pursuing projects in the public domain  its founders said. advertisement but intellectual property aside  the new business is most likely to draw industry interest for its avengers-like joining of executive forces. while mr. braun has a reputation as a generational talent-spotter and social-media marketer  mr. maisel  55  was an early architect of marvels world-dominating plan to stop licensing its characters to hollywood studios and instead self-finance its own movies  beginning with iron man in 2008. after the company was sold to disney for $4 billion the following year  mr. maisel left; he went on to develop and produce the angry birds movie  which  while scoffed at by critics  made $350 million worldwide. that project also got mr. maisel thinking about combining comics and all-ages animation for the big screen. a harvard m.b.a. who came up as a hollywood dealmaker under the creative artists agency co-founder michael ovitz  mr. maisel is also a comic-book obsessive who wore a fathom t-shirt to the interview and brought along a collection of hero figurines. i never understood what he was doing  but i always knew he was really  really smart  kevin huvane  the power agent and managing partner at c.a.a.  said of mr. maisel. he has this encyclopedic knowledge of comic books and treats them like real art  with a savant-like ability to take out characters that appeal to him and make them really relevant. together with mr. braun  a connector with access and knowledge of pop culture in all mediums  mr. huvane said  the two make an explosive combo. the mythos founders met over dinner about five years ago  they had a mutual friend in kanye west  they discovered  and remained in touch as mr. brauns sb projects expanded its non-music division under the chief operating officer scott manson. as mr. maisel circled the aspen comics titles  mr. braun jumped at the chance to partner with someone whose main interest is doing the work  he said. you dont see david in all the social circles or at all the parties  but what you do see is a name associated with some of the most amazing properties out there. mr. manson  who as a longtime friend of mr. brauns refers to his role as managing the manager  will serve as a bridge between the mythos founders. scooters not going to sit in a boardroom for eight hours  mr. manson said. thats why we love david and why were partners.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. as part of the deal  mr. braun agreed to fund mythoss development costs for multiple years through his holding company  ithaca  while the venture considers moving forward independently  partnering with an existing studio or working with a digital player like netflix or amazon. (they wont disclose a budget.) advertisement mr. braun will also provide a potential pipeline for talent (and soundtracks)  with the obvious question being: will mr. bieber end up a superhero? mr. braun laughed. there will be synergies  he said. if any of the talent we work with wants to be a part of the projects were doing  we welcome them to join us on this journey. ive already had conversations with certain talent that are very excited about being a part of this. the other question many will have is whether mythos can break through a glut of comic-book movies with a collection of largely unknown characters. (fathom  about a marine biologist and olympic swimmer who turns out to be part of an underwater race of humanoids  was once teased as a movie starring megan fox  but never happened.) are they as popular as superman or batman? no  mr. braun said. but why do people know the name forrest gump? if you tell a great story  people will care. mr. maisel acknowledged that its a crowded environment out there  but he recalled being scoffed at for attempting to revitalize marvel with so-called d-list characters. its hard to think of it now  but at the time even iron man people thought of as a triathlon sporting event  he said. what ive enjoyed doing in my career is to see opportunities that arent obvious. mr. braun added: we both come from a background of being second-guessed our entire career. i was second-guessed on ariana grande  gangnam style  call me maybe   he said  ticking off hits. thats usually the direction we ran in. a version of this article appears in print on march 28  2018  on page c1 of the new york edition with the headline: 2 moguls will film overlooked crusaders.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement by reggie ugwufeb. 18  2018  do you hear that sound? that clamorous rumbling? its hordes of moviegoers rushing to see black panther like so many vibranium-plated super rhinos. here is your official spoiler alert. (i repeat: spoiler alert.) we will be discussing the ins and outs of marvel studios zeitgeist-swallowing  record-smashing new stand-alone epic in detail below. if you dont have a wakandan stamp in your passport  please wait on the other side of the nylon barrier. for those of you war dogs whove mastered your warrior falls dance  lets talk about the movies most memorable moments and burning questions. have thoughts? share them in the comments section. black panther just feels different than the marvel cinematic universe movies weve come to know  and a large part of that is due to its setting. wakanda is a gleaming metropolis where ancient aesthetics  stunning natural resources and the most advanced technology on earth weave together as part of a rich and distinct tapestry. advertisement the world building starts at the very beginning  with that dazzling animated sequence that illustrates the history of wakanda and its five tribes  and continues through visually arresting set pieces like the ones at warrior falls and the ancestral plane. the new york of the avengers movies is about as exciting as a strip mall by comparison. advertisement now that the director ryan coogler and the production designer hannah beachler have put an afrofuturist paradise on marvels chessboard  the question is what will the company do with it? will it become  as some on social media have suggested  the black star wars  with spinoff movies and tv shows that further explore the movies mythology and cast of characters? [ wondering whats new to stream on netflix  hulu and amazon prime this month? let us help you find the best movies and tv shows. ] lets state the obvious: this movie is very black  possessing a broad-spectrum  pan-african blackness. there are many small moments that spoke directly to the african-american audience (did your theater erupt when shuri re-enacted the what are those?! meme? or when she and tchalla shared that secret handshake?) and still others  like tchallas sandals and the dancing at warrior falls  that felt recognizably african. but perhaps the bigger achievement of the movie is just how natural this all felt. its an argument for the difference a black director and crew can make on a blockbuster. what small moments or cultural references stood out to you? tchallas little sister shuri  an irreverent tech prodigy whos part q from the james bond movies and part penny from inspector gadget  arguably steals the movie. it should be a star-making performance for letitia wright (she previously appeared in the most recent season of black mirror in the episode black museum). in the comics  shuri eventually succeeds tchalla as black panther. might she get her own spinoff movie? or a teen-oriented cartoon show? at the very least  expect her to play a prominent role in the inevitable sequel. its not just the portrayal of the african diaspora in black panther that pushes boundaries  its that of the women. this is the rare superhero movie that doesnt treat the female characters like ornaments or seasoning and even passes the bechdel test. what did you make of okoye (danai gurira of the walking dead) and her all-female fighting squad? okoyes wig-throwing and car-surfing-in-a-red-dress scenes in south korea were among the films most indelible. but was her romance with wkabi (daniel kaluuya) believable? was it necessary? mbaku  the chief of the renegade mountain tribe  starts out as a third-tier villain in the movie but ends up being unexpectedly heroic and pivotal to the plot. if not for him  tchalla would have been belly up in a river somewhere while killmonger waged world war iii from the wakandan throne. advertisement the 31-year-old actor who plays mbaku  the tobagonian-born  american-raised winston duke  is a relative unknown (hes had supporting roles on the tv shows person of interest and modern family) but infuses the role with gravitas  wry charm and incendiary wit. if theres any justice in the world  hell be starring in a rom-com next year. a character that several critics have called the most compelling marvel villain to date  erik killmonger is a unique and thoroughly american revolutionary. his bloodthirsty vision (of sweet revenge for centuries of oppression visited upon african-descended peoples around the world) is provocative because  viewed from the right angle  it offers a convincing approximation of justice. was his primary critique of wakanda  that it has selfishly shirked its responsibilities to other african nations and the diaspora  ultimately correct? or was tchalla right that isolation to the point of invisibility was the only way to ensure that wakanda never met the fate of its subjugated sister nations? killmongers final line  bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships  because they knew death was better than bondage  is among the films most trenchant  and one of the hardest to believe actually exists in a marvel movie. in a film almost entirely populated by black faces  the two main white characters  one a marauding thief (andy serkis as ulysses klaue)  the other an intermittently useful ally (martin freeman as cia agent everett ross)  are a study in contrasts. ross  the butt of several jokes in the movie (shuri taunts him as a colonizer)  exists as a kind of corrective to the white savior characters that are standard in earlier western films about africans. what did you think of the character and how did your theater react to the jokes at his expense? to the politically minded  the wakanda of black panther offers an almost too perfect rebuttal to president trumps comments in january in which he referred to african nations with a disparaging expletive. (of course  the film was completed well before those comments were made.) in the first of two post-credit sequences  tchalla addresses the united nations with a speech that includes this line: the wise build bridges  while the foolish build barriers. is that a pointed reference to the proposed border wall? or just an apropos aphorism for wakandas climactic embrace of internationalist foreign policy? let us hear your wakandan war cries about all the things we called out above (and anything we did not) in the comments section. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page

movies,advertisement by a.o. scottapril 30  2018  the following piece discusses details from the ending of avengers: infinity war.  im not good enough at math to calculate whether the percentage of the worlds population who saw avengers: infinity war over the weekend corresponds to the proportion of marvel superheroes  spoiler alert!  killed at the end of the movie. i suspect  though  that many people who havent seen it yet are already aware of what happens. a lot of superheroes die  perhaps including some of your favorites. tchalla  we hardly knew you! its remarkable how quickly that lethal denouement went from top secret to common knowledge. those of us who were invited to last mondays press screenings received a finger-wagging email asking us to please let everyone else discover the surprises  the jokes  and the twists for themselves and not say too much about what happened. we were accordingly circumspect in the reviews published in the following days  though not enough for some readers. michael phillips of the chicago tribune was scolded on social media because of a headline referring to the ending as bleak. he responded with a characteristically reasonable and scholarly essay on the history of movie spoilers  going back to the crying game and terms of endearment. by which time the point was moot. before avengers: infinity war had been in theaters even a full day  a barrage of post-review think pieces appeared discussing and dissecting the bleakness  most of them dutifully adorned with warnings not to read any further if you wanted to preserve your innocence. and no wonder. the last moments of the film are by far the most interesting. they bring intimations of darkness and grief that feel like something new in the marvel universe. the bad guy (his name is thanos and his chin is remarkable) not only wins  but triumphs in a way that brings despair rather than sequel-setting rage or defiance. his victims dont go down fighting; they turn to dust and drift away in the breeze  watching as their friends and their own limbs decompose. its a reverse rapture  with a somber emotional payoff. [ looking for other pieces to read about the ending of avengers: infinity war? we have you covered. ] advertisement how seriously are we supposed to take it? there is another avengers movie coming next year  which along with this one is meant to represent a finale of sorts. but of course its not really the end. the marvel cinematic universe will keep expanding: release dates are already in place into the next decade  and if disneys acquisition of fox goes through there will be fresh crossover opportunities.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. thanos  when he kills loki early in infinity war  promises no resurrections this time. the intricate logic of the plot  however  there are these magic stones that give their possessor the ability  among other things  to reorder time  suggests a route back to life for black panther  spider-man and the other dead heroes. dr. strange  who can see into the future  might have offered a cryptic prediction to that effect. and here in the real world  plenty of fans and critics have assumed that the next avengers movie will cook up an escape clause. kevin feige  the head of marvel studios  has insisted otherwise. why would he lie? advertisement would reversing the movies ending constitute its own kind of spoiler  cheapening the shock and grief that make infinity war distinctive? movies play with death all the time  turning horror into joy as a way of asserting both their power over our emotions and their marvelous unreality. e.t.s death is shattering  and also temporary. vincent vega  john travoltas pulp fiction hit man  is gunned down in a bathroom in the middle  only to walk out of the diner into the sunshine at the end  revived by the simple secular magic of chronological reordering. comic books have thrived by granting their characters multiple lives and story-lines  allowing them to be both mortal and immortal. life may be short  but intellectual property is eternal  and that may be the real spoiler. marvel and disney have gone to great trouble and expense to make us care and keep us interested  pouring money and talent into a series of movies whose commercial success is one of the inarguable achievements of our time. which may be the problem. there will always be more  which limits both the possibility of surprise and the intensity of feeling that any single episode can deliver. at the end of infinity war you dont need to tell yourself that its only a movie  because it isnt a movie. its a piece of matter in a post-cinematic universe. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement by emily cochraneapril 13  2018  washington  we all know the basic formula for a superhero movie. after the necessary introductions and plot basics  theres the climactic conflict: at least one extraordinary individual doing battle with something evil  ricocheting around skyscrapers and vanquishing foes in the center of a bustling city. theres a snappy one-liner amid rubble and urban destruction. then government officials swoop in with solemn gratitude or veiled warnings to obey the law. those officials are probably not from the federal government  because rarely do these blockbusters of superhuman heroism take place in the nations capital. glimpses of washington have slipped through  captain america  played by chris evans  effortlessly ran laps around the national mall during his second marvel movie; its where the federal government decides to create a team of dangerous criminals to save the world in suicide squad. but the city rarely matters in superhero movies. you see new york  and you see l.a.  said rick prelinger  a film archivist and professor of film and digital media at the university of california  santa cruz. washington isnt being pitched as the center of the world in the ways that it used to be. advertisement how is it that the heart of american democracy is often sidelined in the movies that dominate the box office? the reasons range from our perceptions of the city to the nature of comic books. advertisement a representative for marvel entertainment said that no one was available to discuss the question for this article  and dc comics did not return a request for comment. but some film experts see an identity crisis. outside of the government and the monuments  its hard for hollywood to imagine what washington looks like. and worse (at least for d.c. enthusiasts): whatever it looks like may not be exciting enough for these movies. although its a distinct region  not every city has trucks selling half-smokes  i think that washington isnt part of what a lot of peoples sense of their country is about  said mr. prelinger  who became familiar with the citys iconic sausage dish after living in the district for nearly two decades. he has since moved to california. d.c. is dull. matt fraction  a comic book writer recognized for his work on marvels iron man  hawkeye and other characters  said he found it was a location better served in news clips behind television anchors instead of as an accelerant to a spectacular fight scene. washington is an idea as much as anything else  he said in an interview. washington is about history and abstract notions. kelly sue deconnick  who has written independent comics and developed story lines for captain marvel  points to the mid-20th-century roots of the modern comic book  when the mediums writers and artists worked in new york. though movies arent always faithful to their source material  the city loomed large in the initial stories. it was where the biggest comic publishers were based and where most of their writers were living. that was the center of both the marvel and dc universe  ms. deconnick said. people were telling stories of their lives  of their families  and what was important to them. only washington  d.c.  she added  thinks washington  d.c.  is the center of the universe. its also not an ideal place for dynamic visuals  said corey creekmur  a film professor and comics scholar at the university of iowa. advertisement new york is famously vertical  and washington isnt  he said  pointing to scenes of superman flying over metropolis  the fictional version of new york city  and the avengers plummeting into midtown. its not the space associated with superheroes in that regard. there are also logistics to consider. its hard to build tall buildings in the swamp  things for spider-man to swing off of  mr. fraction said. tom holland  the current spider-man  had to bounce off a helicopter to swing into the washington monument for a dramatic rescue in last years spider-man: homecoming.

movies,advertisement by kevin drapermarch 5  2018  the walt disney company has picked james pitaro  the chairman of its consumer products and interactive division  to be the next president of espn. he replaces john skipper in what is perhaps the most powerful post in sports media. jimmy forged his career at the intersection of technology  sports and media  and his vast experience and keen perspective will be invaluable in taking espn into the future  robert a. iger  the chairman and chief executive of disney  said monday in a statement announcing pitaros appointment. espn  the countrys leading national sports network  has been without a permanent president since december  when skipper  who had led the company since 2012  suddenly resigned  citing a substance addiction. the former espn president george bodenheimer has been serving as the acting chairman since skippers departure. pitaro  48  joined disney in 2010 after nine years at yahoo  where he rose to vice president for media and ran the companys sports division. he began as a co-president of disney interactive  then a stand-alone business unit consisting of gaming  disney.com and other websites. after the companys social gaming division underperformed  pitaros co-president  john pleasants  resigned  giving pitaro control of disney interactive. advertisement in 2015  the interactive division was combined with disneys much larger consumer products division  and pitaro was left in charge of the entire department after leslie ferraro  a co-chairwoman  resigned in 2016. disneys consumer products division is the worlds largest licenser of consumer products  but a comparatively small division within disney. advertisement for the fiscal year ending sept. 30  pitaros division contributed just $4.8 billion of disneys $55.1 billion in revenue  and $1.7 billion of disneys $14.8 billion in operating profit. the divisions revenue represented a 13 percent decrease from 2016  but pitaro pointed to a robust film slate  including black panther; solo: a star wars story; and avengers: infinity war  which should boost consumer products and interactive media  as the division is now called. he now assuming control of a much more substantive chunk of the company. the media networks division of disney  which is largely espn  earned $23.5 billion in revenue and $6.9 billion in operating profit in the same fiscal year. some of the best experiences of my professional career were working with the sports business  pitaro said in an interview. i always knew in my heart i would return. this is a dream come true. he is taking over a very different espn than skipper did six years ago. the network is facing a number of challenges as consumers continue the trend of cord-cutting  jeopardizing the traditional business model for pay television companies. at its peak in 2011  espn had more than 100 million subscribers. it now has fewer than 87 million. the value of disneys stock has fallen 7 percent during the past year  a drop analysts largely attribute to concerns about espns future.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. pitaro on monday did not lay out a new strategy for reversing these declines or for finding new revenue streams. he praised what espn had done in recent years  including a plan to launch a redesigned espn app that gives all consumers access to scores and highlights  and gives subscribers the ability to stream the networks. you fast forward to today  and the espn team has put together a very smart strategy  pitaro said. the app  which will launch in april  will also include espn plus  a new streaming service that will cost $4.99 a month and will stream more than 10 000 live events each year. espn plus is powered by bamtech  the major league baseball advanced media spinoff; disney paid $2.6 billion to acquire 75 percent of the company. espn plus is also a trial run for another stand-alone streaming service disney will offer next year  which will feature movies and television shows from the disney  pixar and marvel libraries. i come from the digital world  and spent most of my career building and investing in new media products  pitaro said. advertisement pitaros appointment breaks espns traditional mold of choosing its presidents from among the companys top executives. one of pitaros biggest tasks will be to help weave bamtechs technology and employees into both espn and disney  as the two companies increasingly share technology and other aspects of their business. bob runs his staff meetings as truly team meetings  and so i have had the opportunity to chime in and participate in strategic discussions of the future of espn over the last eight years  pitaro said of iger. i dont see that changing. disney recently agreed to pay $52.4 billion to acquire most of 21st century foxs assets  including its 22 regional sports networks. the deal is pending regulatory approval. espn also faces an important round of negotiations with pay television distributors who have long complained about the high price of sports programming. an earlier version of this article misstated bill grimess work history before becoming espns president in 1982. he had previously worked for the company;

movies,advertisement by sridhar pappuapril 13  2018  last march  dc entertainment  the arm of warner bros. that controls the commercial rights to the comic book icons superman  batman and wonder woman  among other superheroes  decided it was time to brag about its newest hire. four months earlier  it had announced that it had lured away brian michael bendis from rival marvel  snagging the writer who for nearly two decades had helped reshape and create the characters that served as the basis for multimillion-dollar movie franchises along with animated series and four netflix shows. it was a seismic industry move  not unlike when abcs chief hitmaker shonda rhimes suddenly moved to netflix last year  roiling the tv world. now  dc wanted to further ratchet up expectations. on advertising posters placed in popular comic book stores around the country and on full-page ads within its books  like wonder woman and justice league  a smiling  triumphant superman  his hands at his hips  was standing alongside a chunk of large  bold type that announced: bendis is coming! besides promoting mr. bendis  the ad was a homage to perhaps the last hire from marvel that was this significant: jack kirby  in the early 1970s. mr. kirby was one of the creators of  among other characters  the fantastic four  captain america  iron man  black panther  the avengers  hulk  thor and the x-men. back then  in an attempt to lure marvels loyal fan base to dc  the company blared  kirby is coming. advertisement today  mr. bendis  50  is one of a handful of writers and artists (including jason aaron  gail simone and scott snyder) whom readers will follow from title to title  and whose interpretations can completely help redefine a character and provide plotlines for television and film. advertisement think about how much bendis has shaped what is the current marvel world  said sean howe  author of marvel comics: the untold story. he is in the position to have a big effect on dc. theres no denying the effect mr. bendis had on the disney-owned marvel  but also on popular culture. he reinvigorated daredevil  restarted the avengers in 2004 and introduced jessica jones  the dark  foul-mouthed superpowered private investigator who is now known by millions of binge watchers through her onscreen adaptation on netflix. that same streaming service also features luke cage  who bears an uncanny resemblance to mr. bendis interpretation of the street-level hero. there are very few creators who can be an impact player from the moment they walk in the door  said jim lee  the dc co-publisher. and brian is one of those people. as soon as he walked in  you knew he was going to make a difference. not only the attention he brings  but the quality of story he tells. there are those who have declared the fate of any superhero on the page irrelevant  given the financial success of movies and television and video games based on those same characters. but as john jackson miller  a comic book writer and former trade magazine editor who tracks industry circulation for comichron.com  points out  the death of the medium is a myth  for now. from 2011 to 2016  there was intense growth in sales across print and digital  largely because of individual comic books acting as a serial outlet for graphic novels. in 2016  sales in the industry hovered around $1.08 billion. and while numbers for last year are expected to show a decline in overall sales (most notably with marvel)  those numbers will still exceed $1 billion. comics readers  the ones buying the monthly comics  are the focus group  mr. miller said. they are the ones with the early access fee to get into whats going to be hot  whats going to be in theaters  in video games  in netflix shows. mr. bendis has not been shy about his desire to move beyond word balloons. he is currently writing an x-men spinoff movie for fox to be directed by the deadpool director tim miller. his original character  scarlet  which he created with the artist alex maleev  has been picked up by a television network that mr. bendis said he couldnt yet name. hes fully aware  however  of the limitations of comics. after all  to date  black panther has made $667 million domestically  and become a pinpoint in popular culture  but that wont mean $667 million in new comic book sales for the black panther character. advertisement that has never has happened  mr. bendis said  referring to the bump effect of a popular film. since the christopher reeve superman movie  theres just people who will never read anything  comics  magazines  books; they love their television and film. and thats the way they want to experience these characters  mr. bendis added. but inside that mix is a group of people  usually young people like myself when i was a kid  that finds a character that captivates you  and someone says you should read the comic  and all of a sudden youre reading the comic and are a die-hard fan of comics. you become a die-hard fan of the medium.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mr. bendis  who lives in portland  ore.  with his wife  alisa  and their four children  was born in cleveland  the older of two brothers  and raised by their mother. at age 6  when he discovered that writing and drawing comic books was an actual profession  he declared that someday he would be the artist on spider-man. by 19  he managed  after a rejection  to get accepted by the cleveland institute of art. while still in the city  he began drawing cartoons for the plain dealer while also working on independent comics that brought him critical if not financial success. in order to stay afloat  mr. bendis worked as a caricature artist  even at bar mitzvahs and weddings. then came marvel. mr. bendis  who began writing for the publisher in 1999  can remember vividly the moribund offices in new york as the company crawled out of its 1996 bankruptcy. this was not the raucous center of counterculture that stan lee had romanticized in the 1960s. this was a broken company  one where even the filing cabinets were being put up for sale. at the time  he wondered if he was going to be the person to write the final marvel comic. instead  he had a front-row seat to what he described as the great business comeback story of our time. at marvel  he was part of a select group of writers and editors who advised those assembling and reviving the companys movie franchises. he consulted on the development of every marvel movie from iron man to guardians of the galaxy vol. 2. he wrote video games and worked on animated spider-man television shows. (warner bros. executives  responsible for bringing dc characters to the screen  have already expressed interest in mr. bendiss participation in their endeavors.) in august  as mr. bendiss contract with marvel was coming to an end  he sat down with the dc co-publisher  dan didio  in los angeles for coffee. the two had never met  but they soon found common ground  talking about what characters they liked growing up  their visions for the industry and what mr. bendis could do in new environs. mr. didio made a lucrative and creatively powerful offer. dc would act as a distributor for mr. bendiss independent  creator-owned works under his jinxworld line  which he produces with artistic partners like michael avon oeming and mr. maleev. mr. bendis would head up his own imprint using dc characters  overseeing a select group of artists and writers while also writing himself. perhaps most symbolically  mr. bendis was given a chance to work on the established  marquee character of his choice. while mr. didio expected him to pick batman  everyone wants batman  mr. bendis chose the man of steel  the most prominent and most difficult character in the dc canon. even if superman is not our best seller  mr. didio said  the success and the positioning of the company works because of superman. if superman is working well  the entire line seems to be working well. if its not working well  then it seems like somethings out of whack. its intensely important for us to make sure that the superman franchise is in good hands. mr. bendis said his decision came by accident. last october  while in cleveland for his brother jareds wedding  he walked into the public library. there  he stumbled on an exhibition celebrating the iconic character  which had been created by fellow cleveland natives joe shuster and jerry siegel. christened superman: from cleveland to krypton  the exhibition was complete with beautiful displays of his history in comics and television  radio and film. it was moving to mr. bendis  both as a fan and creator of comics. but at this particular moment  seeing the characters history  it had a greater resonance. advertisement o.k.  god  mr. bendis said to himself. i get it. do superman. when dc released the news on twitter in november  outlets from industry websites to the washington post reacted and speculated on the move. after all  here was a man who had openly taken his shots at dc over the years  specifically questioning the companys decision to entirely reboot the story lines in nearly all of its comics in 2011. and he was vociferous in his criticisms of the bleak and commercially disappointing films man of steel and batman v superman: dawn of justice. i told marvel that i dont see this as going over to the competition  mr. bendis said. i told them i was going to the other side of the place thats in charge of curating this beautiful medium i love so much and keeping these characters alive and vital and relevant. that said  mr. bendis came perilously close to losing this chance to reboot his own career. last december  he nearly died of a mrsa infection  admitted to intensive care at a portland hospital three times. for most of the month  he said  he could not see. drifting in and out of consciousness  he would wake  often to find a member of portlands comic book community sitting by his bedside. that led him to rewrite his final spider-man story for marvel  one in which mr. bendiss version of the character  the half-black  half-latino miles morales  has a similar experience  finding different heroes of the marvel universe there for him when he needed them most. now he will be leaving them  for superman. mr. bendis knows how other people have struggled with the character. over the years  superman has been stripped of his powers  split in half into red and blue versions  even killed. in the 1990s  he was reborn with what can best be described as a mullet. now  mr. bendis  beginning with a 12-page story in action comics no. 1000  will take on the task that many have tried and failed at: invigorating a character that many see as  frankly  boring  without betraying the core of who superman is. when you strip everything away on superman youre basically stripping away all the ridiculous stuff and getting to the real truths  mr. bendis said. its about making your own family versus the family youre born with  about finding out who you are versus where you were put. these are big  big issues that we deal with  he continued. truth  justice and the american way. these things are under siege. this is the world we live in. these are not absolute things anymore. these are things worth fighting for. a version of this article appears in print on april 15  2018  on page bu4 of the new york edition with the headline: can this man make superman cool again?.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

"nobody had ever made any damn money with science fiction " cameron told reporters at the manhattan beach  california  studio where he is in the middle of making two "avatar" sequels. advertisement everything changed with 1977's "star wars " which became the highest-grossing domestic film in history at the time and sent film studios scrambling to imitate it. advertisement "you had a lot of bad science fiction for a while  all trying to cash in on 'star wars '" cameron said. "then the whole genre elevated and became much more what it is today  which is much more a part of the mainstream culture." today  movies grounded in science fiction are among the biggest draws at box offices. cameron's "avatar" holds the current record for ticket sales with $2.8 billion worldwide. this weekend's "avengers: infinity war " from walt disney co's marvel studios  is expected to rank among the top u.s. and canadian openings of all time.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. in the series called "amc visionaries: james cameron's story of science fiction " cameron interviews fellow directors steven spielberg  guillermo del toro  george lucas  ridley scott and christopher nolan about filmmaking and their influences. cameron traded notes with the directors on their favorite sci-fi literature from as far back as the 1930s  something he wanted to highlight as a key part of the genre's origins. "what was important to me for this series was to trace back the dna of these stories " cameron said. "so if you've got a time travel story  where did that come from? if you've got a space story  how did that enter our popular culture? why did science fiction as a genre struggle to try and popularize these ideas?" cameron argued that science fiction is now more relevant than ever as humans become more dependent on machines.

(the entire guardians of the galaxy cast got about two seconds onscreen.) operating on a much more patient and modest level is agents of s.h.i.e.l.d.  which centers on a spy agency of regular humans fighting supernatural forces; the show has generated unsexy but reliable reviews and ratings over four seasons. season 5s two-hour premiere finds agent coulson (clark gregg) and his team stranded on a mysterious ship deep in outer space. dark on netflix. this streaming service has put an emphasis on creating content from across the globe  and friday marks the release of its first original german-language series. the show takes place in a small town next to a nuclear power plant; a young boy disappears and a body is found in the woods. the show possesses a sensibility specific to its country: i dont know if its german angst  but there is something uniquely creepy about germans  at least from the outside perspective  the writer jantje friese  one of the shows creators  told the times in an interview. east los high on hulu. this drama was one of hulus first forays into original programming in 2013; it follows a group of latino high schoolers in east los angeles navigating everything teenagers do in television shows  friendships  sex  drugs  family. after ending season 4 with a huge cliffhanger  the show will bow out as hulus longest-running series with this stand-alone one-hour finale. the plot picks up eight months later  as the group prepares to leave high school  and possibly los angeles  behind. hitch (2005) on netflix. new to netflix: will smith stars as alex hitchens  a date doctor whose suaveness and charm are irresistible  until he meets sara melas (eva mendes)  an unflappable  witty gossip columnist who seems impervious to his advances. the movie has plenty of dopey physical comedy  particularly from mr. smith and kevin james  but also reveals a deeply romantic core. voyeur on netflix. for decades starting in 1966  the colorado motel owner gerald foos spied on his residents through walls  mostly watching them have sex. he brought his story to the journalist gay talese  who waited 25 years to publish mr. fooss queasy story in a book  the voyeurs motel. but the book itself created a firestorm over its accuracy and moral integrity  how complicit was mr. talese himself in mr. fooss reprehensible acts? this documentary  which debuted at this years new york film festival  features interviews with mr. foos and mr. talese as they wrestle with an onslaught of criticism and their own complex relationship. a version of this schedule appears in print on december 1  2017  on page c16 of the new york edition with the headline: whats on friday.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement by jennifer schuesslermay 3  2018  it was a few hours before the premiere of marvels avengers: infinity war late last month  and benedict cumberbatch was not about to violate the studios ban on spoilers surrounding the penultimate chapter of the most lucrative movie franchise ever. dont ask  he said  in response to a mock-question about his turn as doctor strange. all i can give you is a nice recipe for aperol spritz. but mr. cumberbatch was happy to speak volubly about another complex work of serial narrative hitting the screen this spring  one that also unfolded over many years  commands an ardent fan base and features him as an unusually intelligent man battling dark forces (albeit armed with vicious wit and bulletproof irony rather than magical orbs). patrick melrose  a five-part limited series that debuts on showtime on may 12  is based on five autobiographical novels by the british writer edward st. aubyn  whose exquisite prose and subtle portraiture have won them almost cultish devotion. published between 1992 and 2011  they follow an upper-class englishman on a 40-year journey of recovery from horrific childhood abuse  addiction and the soul-killing snobbery of his milieu. advertisement o.k.  patrick may not quite recover from that last affliction  as some dissidents from the reverence surrounding the st. aubyn universe have noted. but mr. cumberbatch has little patience with those who hold it too much against him. i got very shirty recently with a british journalist who said of patrick  hes a bit of an unlikable posho  isnt he? he said. its too easy to dismiss him as just another well-heeled drug addict gone wrong. advertisement even as the show revels in its stunning locations (including a magically situated farmhouse in the south of france) and louchely glamorous characters  the promotional campaign leans hard on its relatable themes of family  trauma  addiction  recovery and forgiveness. i dont think snobbery  self-loathing  cynicism and hypocrisy are exclusive to that class  said mr. cumberbatch  a graduate of harrow (and a great-grandson of queen victorias consul general in turkey and lebanon). what mr. st. aubyns novels do  with great humor and painful insight  is lay out the extremes of the human condition. mr. st. aubyns literary alter-ego has been a dream role for mr. cumberbatch  who since coming to fame with the bbcs sherlock has tended to toggle between blockbusters (star trek: into darkness  the coming dr. seuss the grinch) and artier fare like the imitation game and the recent television adaptation of ian mcewans novel the child in time. in an ask me anything on reddit in 2013  he named patrick melrose as the literary character he would most like to play. the comment made its way onto twitter  and soon he got a call from the producers michael jackson and rachael horovitz  who had acquired the rights to the novels and were working on scripts with the screenwriter and novelist david nicholls (one day  far from the madding crowd). the only other role on mr. cumberbatchs bucket list  he has said  was hamlet  a character who shares patricks brilliance  arrogance  wit  cruelty  self-destructiveness and  in his reading  not dissimilar daddy issues. hamlets father was a cold man  someone very distant and difficult to love  he said. and as with patrick  its the undoing of the myth of the father that brings hamlet into a more loving relationship with the world. advertisement mr. cumberbatch played hamlet in london in 2015  in a production that sold out almost instantly and generated the pitched fan frenzy that has come to surround this 41-year-old star  whose off-kilter byronic handsomeness has drawn some deeply strange tributes. (take heart  cumberbitches: patrick may be fattened up via prosthetics by episode 4 and heavily weathered by episode 5  but its my hair all the way through  mr. cumberbatch noted.) while that role may have seemed inevitable  the road to patrick melrose was more uncertain. mr. jackson said he had been given the first novel by a mutual friend of his and mr. st. aubyns. mr. st. aubyns novels may come with sexy plot elements and guillotine-sharp dialogue  but it took the final installment  at last  which came out in 2011  to convince mr. jackson that an adaptation seemed possible. only then could you really follow the cause and effect of childhood over a sweep of time  which is the classical television format  he said. even then  translating the long passages of interior reflection  sometimes dense philosophical rumination  and quicksilver leaps of memory and association were challenging. ive never written so many drafts of anything in my life  mr. nicholls said. each episode  like four of the novels  takes place on a single  pivotal day in patricks life. early on  mr. jackson and ms. horovitz hit on the notion of making each of the hourlong episodes a distinct mini-movie  with a different visual style and tone. (they briefly toyed with the idea of hiring five directors but ultimately settled on edward berger  a german whose credits include the stasi drama deutschland 83.) the first episode  the antically comic bad news (based on the second novel)  in which patrick visits new york to pick up his fathers ashes and goes on a bender  plays like an upmarket trainspotting  complete with hallucinations and at least one indelible bathroom scene. the second  never mind  loops back to a particularly nightmarish day in patricks childhood at the melrose family home in the south of france  capped off with a pinter-esquedinner party with dialogue so dryly vicious it nearly vaporizes the roast. the third episode  some hope  set at an elaborate country house party where the guests await the arrival of princess margaret  is more of a social satire in the gosford park vein. its just this wonderful circus of the very worst behavior of that class  with everything toxic coming to the surface  mr. cumberbatch said.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. filmed at west wycombe house  a stately home in west sussex that also appeared in downton abbey  it features long steadicam shots that weave from room to room (including one four-minute sequence that took 17 takes) and more than 150 extras. among them is mr. st. aubyn  who can be spotted listening as an unbearably snobbish melrose family friend talks with the french ambassador. advertisement i felt a terrible impulse to introduce a spontaneous new line of dialogue  he said. some scenes were reworked on the fly  like a sequence in the first episode where patrick undergoes a drug-fueled dark night of the soul in a hotel suite  unleashing a torrent of differently accented voices before collapsing. mr. cumberbatch collaborated with mr. st. aubyn and mr. nicholls on an on-set manic rewrite  as he put it  switching different lines of from the novel (which unfolds largely as dialogue in patricks head) in and out. i was rewriting it and learning it at the same time  and i thought: this is crazy. i feel like im doing a one-man show in edinburgh  he said. it felt like i  as benedict  was coming undone. as patricks father  david  a thwarted pianist whose snobbery is topped only by his cruelty  hugo weaving (best known as agent smith from the matrix) manages to be terrifying from the first moment he appears  lying stock still in his coffin in episode 1. benedict was poking me  trying to get me to raise from the dead  mr. weaving said of the sequence where patrick touches the corpses face (the only seconds in the series where he and mr. cumberbatch are onscreen together). but i wasnt giving him anything. as for eleanor  patricks mother (played by jennifer jason leigh)  the novels depict her  unforgivingly  as a monster of neglect and deluded self-pity. but ms. leigh  whose own mother died two years ago  said she wanted to draw out her tender  thwarted core  especially in the later scenes  where a stroke has left her struggling to communicate. people are going to vilify eleanor  she said. to me  it was very crucial to be faithful to the vulnerability and the nakedness of that time in life  when all your defenses are stripped away. mr. cumberbatch said he hoped the humanity of the characters would pull people through the sometimes unbearable darkness of the story. what patrick is arcing toward as a character  the ultimate shift is letting go of his fathers ghost  he said. he behaves abominably  but hes evolving from being a victim to being a survivor. follow jennifer schuessler on twitter: @jennyschuessler a version of this article appears in print on may 6  2018  on page ar26 of the new york edition with the headline: facing demons  without superpowers.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

movies,advertisement by the associated pressapril 24  2018  2:34 p.m. e.d.t.  los angeles   marvel studios president kevin feige talks about his job like a fan who's just lucky to be there. to hear his genuine enthusiasm about the movies  the actors  the audience and the stories almost belies the fact that he is essentially the architect of and driving force behind hollywood's most valuable brand that has in just over 10 years netted over $14.8 billion in worldwide grosses (according to comscore) and become the envy of every studio executive in town. he's a mogul with a fanboy's verve who has helped to change the very fabric of the entertainment industry. ten years ago  many moviegoers didn't know who iron man was  and those who did thought of him as a minor comic book character. on thursday  marvel studios' 19th film  "avengers: infinity war " an epic mashup of characters once considered to be part of the "superhero b-list " from iron man to star lord  opens in theaters worldwide. it is cruising for a record-breaking debut that could surpass "star wars: the force awakens" as the biggest opening ever. advertisement the scope of the marvel effect is somewhat difficult to pin down  especially with a force as formidable as the walt disney co. behind it. (disney acquired marvel entertainment for $4 billion in 2009.) advertisement it's revitalized careers (robert downey jr.)  minted movie stars (chris hemsworth  chris evans and chris pratt  to name a few)  and become an outpost for oscar-winners too (like robert redford  gwyneth paltrow  anthony hopkins  natalie portman  jeff bridges  michael douglas and cate blanchett). and beyond that  every few months the studio seems to be breaking new ground  whether it's as small as a change in tone  like "thor: ragnarok " or as big as producing a downright cultural phenomenon  such as "black panther " now the third highest-grossing domestic film of all time. "we dream big at marvel studios. we have very lofty aspirations at marvel studios. for those dreams to be surpassed is saying something " feige  44  said of "black panther's" success. and it shows no sign of slowing down  or running out of story. they have 70 years of comic book source material to draw on  after all. "there are still things that are key elements to a lot of our characters in their comic incarnations that we haven't even done yet for characters who have had three or four movies " feige said. "it is an amazing wealth of creative material to pull from." feige is amused when reporters try to predict marvel's next move  or make big conclusions based on what's just happened. under feige  marvel is not looking in the rear-view mirror. when "thor: ragnarok" came out  he remembers reading articles declaring that  "marvel is committing to a surrealist  silly tone" and just laughed. advertisement "i thought  'we have 'black panther' coming out in three months! they don't even know what's coming '" feige said. "we're always thinking ahead. just when people think they can pin us down  we go somewhere else and that's going to happen again after 'infinity war' in the build-up to the next avengers film. and we had meetings earlier today about 2024 and 2025."  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. misunderstanding feige's vision is almost a tradition at this point  going back to comic-con in 2006 where he revealed his plans for the first few films iron man  ant-man and the incredible hulk  and all anyone wrote about is how marvel studios didn't have the rights to spider-man (sony does)  the x-men or the fantastic four (those reside at 20th century fox). now  few would argue that iron man  captain america  thor  black panther  the guardians of the galaxy and even doctor strange and ant-man aren't veritable a-listers on their own  and even more powerful together  making up what is perhaps marvel's greatest innovation  the marvel cinematic universe. this idea of an interconnected  ever-expanding "universe" of characters and films is something that many have since tried to copy to varying degrees of success. it seems audiences don't begrudge marvel for creating the concept  but are somewhat more skeptical of those trying to capitalize on it. "(marvel's) approach doesn't seem nearly as cynical as when you see another studio trying to do it with  say  ghostbusters or dc " said wall street journal reporter ben fritz  who delves into marvel's history in the book "the big picture: the fight for the future of movies." ''people are like  'oh i know what you're doing  you're trying to copy marvel.' but marvel did it first and marvel has still done it best." "sequel fatigue" doesn't even seem to apply to marvel films anymore. "i think you can look at marvel as a grand narrative experiment " said 'infinity war' co-director joe russo. "never before in films have we seen this many franchises combined over this many years into one giant mosaic. two-hour  two-dimensional storytelling has dominated american culture for 100 years and now we're consuming content with such extreme speed that we need new forms of storytelling. i think what marvel is doing is a new form of storytelling." "infinity war" co-screenwriter stephen mcfeely  who also co-wrote the three captain america films  said feige should get the film academy's irving g. thalberg memorial award for his impact on the industry. "he's clearly changed the way hollywood works  or at least the top box office end of it " mcfeely said. "it's in part because kevin has a really good mind for story  he's ambitious  but he's not so ambitious that he's not going to do the right thing for the movie in front of his face." while navel-gazing isn't feige's favorite activity  the 10-year anniversary of "iron man" hitting theaters has provided an excuse to reflect a bit. he still remembers the early days  when they had everything to prove and felt grateful for the chance to produce films on their own. while the grand plans and concurrent filmmaking have gotten more complex over the years and "the days have gotten longer " feige said the fundamental processes for how they make films goes back to the beginning. "it was in the cutting rooms of 'iron man 1' that in a lot of ways the marvel studios process was born  of just keep trying things and keep turning things over and don't rest on your laurels and just because something is working doesn't mean it can't work better " feige said. advertisement audiences won't have to wait too long for another avengers  either. the fourth avengers film  also directed by joe and anthony russo and written by mcfeely and christopher markus is just around the corner  set for a may 2019 release. it's a continuation of the story that begins in "infinity war " where a still-fractured avengers face thanos (josh brolin). little is being revealed beyond that. the film premiered monday night in los angeles and is said to be full of surprises. "we make movies we believe in. we make movies that we think will be entertaining to ourselves and think about ourselves as the first audience members for any movie we make. any idea that comes up in a room: would we be entertained by this? would we be moved by this? would we be surprised by this?" feige said. "it goes back to the movies i loved growing up. i always loved sequels. i never found myself being cynical or dismissive of sequels. if they were bad  i was disappointed. but i always loved the promise of seeing the further storylines or further adventures of characters i'd grown to love. that's all we're doing." ___ were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement supported by also  the meghan markle effect and how lebron james and the cavaliers suited up in thom browne. by vanessa friedman hello and happy friday  or  as it is known in my house  infinity war day. yes  we have been waiting with bated breath for the latest avengers marvel extravaganza to hit the big screen. im not ashamed to admit it. i love a blockbuster. i dont even need to justify going as research  though it is that  too. those bright shiny colors! that leather cat suit! those combat trousers! these images will be so ubiquitous  the details cant help but seep into our wardrobes.  indeed  this has been an unusually big week for external events that i bet will influence fashion. aside from the marvel flick  there was the debut of season 2 of the handmaids tale. if the first season sparked a renaissance in red cloaks-as-protest wear  this time around my money is on the faded blues and storm cloud grays of the unwomen in the colonies. then there was the debut of royal baby #3  who is bound to be a mini-influencer in the vein of older siblings william and charlotte (whose outfit to meet her new baby brother sold out pretty much instantaneously.)  however  it was their mothers camera-ready hair and makeup and cherry red dress  donned a few hours after giving birth  that got everyone talking. personally  i hope that is not an influence on anyone: the idea that one should look blow-dried to perfection immediately after having a baby is entirely unrealistic; another example of the beauty standard denialism my colleague amanda hess wrote about this week in reference to amy schumers new movie  i feel pretty. still  we are definitely on the verge of another major royal influencer as meghan markle makes the transition from suits (yes  i watched the final episode) to kensington palace. the way her fashion choices push purchasing buttons in the rest of us amazed me when i started collecting the data  and then got me thinking about why.  you can read my hypothesis below (and send me some of your own). or check out the deeply moving story of some of the survivors of the rana plaza factory disaster  and the inside scoop on lebron jamess strategic rationale for convincing his cleveland cavalier teammates that they all needed to suit up pregame in thom browne. and if anyone is going to be in new york between now and october 8  l suggest you stop by the new-york historical society and take in the exhibit walk this way: footwear from the stuart weitzman collection of historic shoes. youll never think about footwear in quite the same way again. now excuse me while i go reserve my multiplex tickets. q: all the things in the stores that are supposed to be cooler  arent. seersucker needs to come back. can it be made from hemp and bamboo and cotton? ive had to scour goodwill and amazon  with delightful but very rare results at goodwill and depressing results on amazon. please  find some artist to find a way to do updated seersucker  preferably before the next 110-degree heat wave with 80 percent humidity?  jan  california a: its true  if alfred lord tennyson had been a fashion scribe  he might well have noted  in the spring a young mans  or womans  fancy lightly turns to thoughts of seersucker. few fabrics say warm weather as directly as the pastel-and-white striped  slightly crinkly cotton kind. thats why it is one of the only fabrics (as far as i know  though i did not have time for comprehensive research  so i am hedging my bets) that was given its own official day: june 8  2017 was designated national seersucker day by u.s. senator bill cassidy. i remember it clearly because it was also the day james comey testified before congress  and while grilling the former fbi director  lots of senate interlocutors including dianne feinstein were in seersucker compliance.  the point being that while seersucker may not be on-trend this fashion season  it has not gone away  and there are still plenty of places you can get options. on the higher end  thom browne and brooks brothers both have multiple styles and cuts for both men and women. so do j. crew  lands end (some great cropped capri pants)  vineyard vines and even uniqlo.  id actually advise seeing this one as an investment piece  though  as i think its a perennial. vanessa friedman is the times's fashion director and chief fashion critic. she was previously the fashion editor of the financial times.@vvfriedman advertisement    collapse see my options

(wait  is there a difference?)  but while we can talk for hours about that  and id love to hear your thoughts  id also love to hear your thoughts on open thread: what do you want more of? less of? is there another place youd like to continue the conversation? is friday afternoon a good time for this to land in your inbox or do you wish you woke up to this  say  monday or tuesday morning?  please tell us your opinion at openthread@nytimes.com.  i already get emails from some of you  in response to last weeks note  for example  martha mclendon wrote to let me know about a great seersucker dress currently available at zara. and deborah landis from u.c.l.a. made the very relevant point that female costume designers do not get the credit the deserve.  shes right  so i am fixing that now: if the handmaids tale affects fashion  its down to anne crabtree; if avengers: infinity war does  thats thanks to judianna makovsky. so lets keep the back and forth going. one change id like to make is to highlight the most interesting and pointed responses i get to each newsletter the following week  as above. im sure there are more improvements you can think of  so send em in. in the meantime  get ready with your met prep: no  not manicures and facials  but information gathering. weve updated our all-you-need-to-know explainer about the party of the year. jason horowitz  the new york timess rome bureau chief  got the inside scoop on how the metropolitan museum convinced the vatican that a fashion exhibit was a good idea. hint: it took a lot of work. however  if youve had it up to here with the party  spend some time remembering handbag artist judith leiber instead; discover why dandy cameron silver is selling off a lot of his clothes (and what it means for the rest of us); and find out how the sensibility of zac posens artist dad helped form his sons aesthetic  and where to see his work.  have a good weekend. q: like kudzo  viscose is everywhere. pricey carpets made of viscose are labeled art silk  but what about fashion? a piazza sempione dress i bought for mucho dinero is viscose; akris punto dresses are made of viscose. it looks and feels like silk but it isnt  and the high prices associated with these formerly silk dresses remain high. whats the story with viscose?  gloria  mass. a: well  first: like silk or pretty much any fabric  not all viscoses are created equal  which makes sense when you realize the official name for viscose is viscose rayon  and it is one of the oldest man-made fibers  first patented in 1884 by hilaire de bernigaut.  just because it is man-made  however  does not mean it is synthetic (though its not exactly all-natural either): viscose is made from wood pulp that has been chemically treated. its name comes from a viscous  get it?  solution used during the process. the end product can have  as you point out  the feel of silk  though it can also mimic cotton and velvet. and just because it is man-made also does not mean it equates to cheap  especially if a designer is involved  when what you are paying for is in part the creativity and brand attached to the garment. so toss that idea in the scrap pile. as to why designers like it  according to joseph altuzarra  who founded an eponymous brand that is favored by meghan markle: i think viscose is misunderstood because it isnt a completely natural fiber  and natural fibers are usually thought-of more highly. i find that viscose drapes really beautifully  and i like viscoses hand. it also sews and wears really nicely. in the past few years  ive noticed mills have developed a lot more interesting viscose fabrications  and pushed the limits of what you can do with it  and i have been really inspired by that. so there you go. from his email to your closet. vanessa friedman is the times's fashion director and chief fashion critic. she was previously the fashion editor of the financial times.@vvfriedman advertisement    collapse see my options

movies,advertisement  here and now  by                      judy berman  april 2  2018  finally  duc bayer-boatwright gets his moment in the sun. dont get too excited; its not that he has a psychological breakthrough or stops being a jerk or even has a particularly substantial story line in this weeks episode of here and now. for the second week in a row  hes gritting his teeth through a colitis flare-up  and ramons poop jokes arent helping. ducs big scene takes place during a hike with his love interest  carmen. doubled over in pain  he gets so frantic about finding a place to relieve himself that he falls down a hill and exits the date in an ambulance. duc is  in other words  as hapless as ever in episode 8. but that makes him the ideal avatar for this weeks theme  as revealed in gregs lecture. as an introduction to a lesson on the myth of sisyphus  albert camuss essay on embracing the absurdity of a meaningless life over suicide  professor boatwright alarms his students by pressing a gun to his chin and demanding a reason not to pull the trigger. by persisting  he explains  we become the absurdist hero  seeking meaning we know is not there  living life to its fullest in the face of a consistent and continuous struggle and inevitable failure. when the stunt ends in an involuntary six-month leave  the irony is that gregs message to students was actually pretty life affirming  for once. sisyphus  a character from greek mythology  was condemned to spend eternity pushing a boulder up a hill  only to watch it fall each time to the bottom. grim as that fate may seem  camus reframes sisyphus as an absurdist hero  scrambling fruitlessly but nobly to make meaning for as long as he can keep the rock that is his life rolling. the struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a mans heart  camus writes in the essays famous conclusion. one must imagine sisyphus happy. considering that few afflictions scream absurdity like a benign yet incurable bout of diarrhea  i assume theres some symbolism in ducs tumble down the hill. usually  ramon and audrey are the shows great rock pushers  fighting tirelessly for empathy in a world that keeps knocking it down in favor of fear. but this week  both characters take some time off from their respective forms of martyrdom. audrey  who is always there to comfort and nag her husband and children  skips a family dinner to consummate her flirtation with steve. (she can thank ashley for giving her the sexy heels that catch his eye.) arriving at home next morning  she takes pleasure in informing a gloomy greg of her conquest. advertisement ramon  for his part  hasnt been the same since his hallucination at the video game expo. after blowing up at farid  he flees his parents house for his own apartment and buries his sorrows over his deteriorating mental health (and perhaps his uncertain future as a game designer) in casual sex. i feel fire  carmen  who comes across as a sort of new age palm reader  tells him in their first session. she also mentions that hes heading for big changes and prods him about a mysterious near-death experience. advertisement when her intuition comes up short  she assures ramon  the answers are in you. whether she knows it or not  shes likely referring to his game and his therapy with farid  neither of which look especially promising by the end of the episode. farid seems to be approaching a breaking point. his dreams are haunted by butterflies. hes seeing 11:11 everywhere. out to dinner with layla  he flies into a rage when the host asks her to remove her head scarf. and hes become so desperate for insight into his psychic connection with ramon that he violates doctor-patient confidentiality by appealing to audrey for help. still convinced that her son is schizophrenic  she decides that farid has come unglued and orders him to stay away from ramon.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. later in the episode  theres an awkward encounter at the store his uncle amir used to own. propelled by a dream involving the store  farid stops by for the first time in quite a while. the shops new owner recognizes him and saddles him with a box of things amir left behind. inside  farid finds an answering machine that he remembers from childhood  along with a tape. when he plays it  he hears what we can assume is his mothers voice. this is huge: decades before  she had tried to contact him  but amir lied to keep him from picking up the phone. ramons and farids mothers  who are prominent in their visions  clearly play a significant role in whatever connection the characters have to each other. so  if farid manages to find some answers about his mom  those revelations could have major implications for both men  and for the shows supernatural plot  which is still creeping along at a frustratingly slow pace. at least weve got kristen and navid  whose quest to get even with madison results in some satisfying mean-girl screams and a triumphant kiss between the two masked avengers. like ramon  they are among the shows best characters because their story lines revolve around who they are as individuals  rather than their identity markers. (pity ashley  whose slightly unbelievable confrontation with a middle-aged  white  male black lives matter activist drives her to the gun range.) i love that navid is attracted to girls  despite being drawn to womens clothing and makeup  and that his quiet iconoclasm seems to electrify the chronically bored kristen. with only two episodes left in the season  here and now is going to have to cover a lot of ground to provide a satisfying finale. the future of greg and audreys marriage remains uncertain; farid and laylas relationship is also starting to look pretty fragile. the story of ramon and henry feels unfinished. ashley and duc have yet to become fully fleshed-out characters. wonderful as they are together  navid and kristen are fighting a war with madison that comes straight out of a teen comedy and isnt really connected yet with the rest of the show. most of all  even if we dont get a full explanation of the connection between ramon and farid  weve got to have something more than just these dreams and hallucinations  which are becoming redundant. we need the show to stop throwing philosophical theories at us and start sketching out a distinctive point of view. gregs lecture suggests that it is possible to find some fleeting semblance of meaning in an indifferent universe. here and now may not have a cure for our modern ailments  but it could at least give us a reason to keep pushing that boulder up the hill. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more  go to home page  
movies,advertisement by andrew r. chowmay 6  2018  what records is avengers: infinity war not going to break? the disney/marvel film continued to vaporize its competition in its second week  becoming the fastest film ever to cross $1 billion globally. domestically  the film took in another $112 million  the second biggest second weekend ever  behind star wars: the force awakens  and has now made $450 million in the u.s. and canada. the film cruised past the cumulative total of many of the wildly successful predecessors in the marvel cinematic universe  including spider-man: homecoming  thor: ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy vol. 2. records are being set around the world  including for the biggest opening day ever in russia. and the movie has still not touched down in china  where it is expected to draw a mammoth audience. the films continued success reinforces the dominance of both disney and marvel studios in hollywood. disney just crossed $3 billion for 2018  breaking its own record for the shortest time to reach that landmark in a given year. and marvel has another potential blockbuster  deadpool 2  with ryan reynolds  arriving may 18. in second place  and trailing by $98 million  was overboard  a gender-swapped remake of the 1987 romantic comedy with the same title. the film stars anna faris and eugenio derbez as unlikely lovers  and was produced by mgm and pantelion films  a lionsgate-backed production company aimed at latino audiences. (the film will open in mexico this week  where mr. derbez is a huge star). while the film received poor reviews  it also earned an a- cinemascore  which often bodes well for word-of-mouth ticket sales. focus features tully  starring charlize theron as an overworked mother  came in sixth with $3.2 million in 1 353 theaters according to comscore  which compiles box office data. and bad samaritan  starring david tennant as a sadistic villain  scraped to $1.6 million in 2 007 theaters. the director dean devlin self-distributed and marketed this movie through his own company electric entertainment. were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page  
movies,advertisement by bruce frettsfeb. 5  2018  it was a truly super sunday for movie fans  or at least for movie-trailer fans  as spots for more than a half-dozen features dropped during the game. that includes the teasers for solo: a star wars story and the cloverfield paradox  the sci-fi horror sequel netflix sprang on a surprised public immediately after the philadelphia eagles equally shocking victory over the new england patriots. so which trailers scored? heres the final tally. a quiet place (coming april 6) director-star john krasinski cut through all the noise with a largely silent and highly effective commercial for his family-in-jeopardy thriller with his real-life wife  emily blunt. mr. krasinski also appeared in an ad for amazons new series  tom clancys jack ryan (in which he stars)  making him the days trailer mvp. jurassic world: fallen kingdom (coming june 22) the sequels second trailer brings the terror home as dinosaurs invade a childs bedroom. it also offers our first look at a pair of brits  rafe spall and toby jones  joining the cast. oh  and a volcano erupts  so theres that  and the spot ends with a genuinely startling moment that had viewers jumping off their couches. skyscraper (coming july 13) dwayne johnson is on a roll with jumanji: welcome to the jungle returning to the top of the box-office chart in its seventh weekend and the trailer for his monster movie rampage (due april 20) generating strong buzz. this action flick  which casts him as a dad with a prosthetic leg who must rescue his family from a burning 240-floor building  looks to have a die hard-like appeal. advertisement red sparrow (coming march 2) the commercial  titled shes out of your league  adds nothing to an earlier trailer for the drama starring jennifer lawrence as a russian spy who is trained to seduce and destroy enemies but falls for an american agent (joel edgerton). it also doesnt make red sparrow seem different enough from black widow (scarlett johansson) from the avengers franchise. speaking of which  avengers: infinity war (coming may 4) so this is it  it all been leading to this  is the first line of the this 30-second spot for marvels sequel. yet even with the avengers  including tony stark (robert downey jr.) a.k.a. iron man  colliding with the guardians of the galaxy  the ad seems underwhelming compared with the exhilarating trailer for the imminent black panther. dont blink or youll miss that films star  chadwick boseman  here. fans may be the ones asking  so this is it? mission: impossible  fallout (coming july 27) the 30-second ad shown during the game cut together scenes of ethan hunt (tom cruise) running  jumping and crashing various vehicles. in short  it made fallout look a lot like the first five mission: impossible movies. the two-and-a-half minute trailer released online gives longer glimpses of his new co-stars angela bassett and henry cavill as well as a better explanation of the plot. but will audiences choose to accept it? were interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page

movies,advertisement supported by in advance of avengers: infinity war  superfans come together for an epic shared experience in a times square multiplex. by jason bailey for my money  the two smartest people in auditorium 17 of the amc empire 25 in times square were karina aguilar guerrero and jaylin lugardo. they had made a pallet on the floor between the front row and the screen  with blankets  pillows and stuffed animals. they had portable phone chargers  snacks and coffee.  they were going to need every one of those supplies  and i should know  we were all there for the 31-hour avengers: infinity war marathon being held by amc theaters  11 of the films in the marvel cinematic universe being screened in a row  followed by the film the event was named for. this was for serious fans only. ms. guerrero and ms. lugardo  who were skipping two days of class  are very serious fans. they were each planning to rewatch the movies before the friday release of infinity war. but when they heard about the marathon  ms. guerrero decided  thats a lot cooler than me doing it by myself in my room. plenty of other marvel superfans came to the same conclusion. amc devoted two screens in times square to the marathon (there were other locations around the country)  and both sold out. thats more than 500 tickets at $75 a pop  and some moviegoers spent more to get there; larry raab flew in from salt lake city  shelling out for an airline ticket and an airbnb. it was his first time in new york. i looked to see if there were any local theaters doing it  and there werent  he said. i went to amcs website  and saw there were a few seats left here  and i decided to go for it. never done anything spontaneous like that before. (he sneaked out during the daytime movies to do some sightseeing.) i came from only as far as washington heights  but felt very much a stranger in a strange land among the superfans. a casual admirer of the series (ive enjoyed some of the movies; others  not so much)  i was interested to see what would inspire so many people to subject themselves to what sounded worrisomely close to the aversion therapy scene in a clockwork orange. but i discovered that the movies were only a part of what we were there for. (i also discovered the importance of ducking into a drugstore for a toothbrush and deodorant.) so i stopped on the way for a philly cheesesteak (the first of several poor culinary decisions) and arrived at the theater just before 1 p.m. on wednesday  picking up my special-edition avengers badge  marvel poster and lanyard (for easy readmittance over the next day and a half). the show began promptly at 1:30  and at times  it was like being at a rock concert where the band only played the hits. the crowd cheered  loudly and often: for the marvel logo at the start of iron man (2008)  the first film in the series; for the introductions of their favorite characters; for catchphrases  like captain americas i can do this all day; for each cameo by the marvel comics giant stan lee; for the first kiss between steve rogers and peggy  or thor and jane. (thors first shirtless appearance was greeted by an audible day-um.)  it wasnt the first time fans had the opportunity to marathon their marvel. steven krietzberg was at the first one  leading up to the release of the avengers in 2012  as well as the 2015 avengers: age of ultron marathon and the mini-thon before captain america: civil war a year later. why did he choose to revisit them in a multiplex  rather than the comfort of his own home? you get to see them the way they were meant to be seen  on the big screen  he says. this is pure movie magic to me.  others were drawn to the appeal of the shared experience. i struck up a conversation in the concession line with oshana mccoy  who attended the pre-ultron marathon and said such events offered the opportunity to plug into a community. were not necessarily the most social people  she admitted  but you start talking to the people next to you  the people in front of you  going to the concession stand. ms. mccoy attended with her sister  jamie  and their friend desmonae jones  and there were several ticket holders like them  groups of friends  decked out in their best marvel gear. there were are also pals in pairs  and couples on very long dates. and some people were flying solo. my friends definitely arent interested in things like this  alexis reliford said  laughing. she took two days off work for the marathon. they think im weird! but coming to things like this  you kind of meet people who are like you. whats more  they dont all look like  say  someone akin to the comic book guy on the simpsons.  you will see everybody here  ms. mccoy predicted. the last one  we had kids in theater  senior citizens in the theater  and they stayed up the entire time. and she was right  there wasnt a dominant sex  race  or age in the theater. the only thing everyone had in common was that they love these movies.  as day turned into night  some slept  as i did  slumped in their upright chair  airplane-style. taking advantage of neighbors who had slipped out  some curled up on a series of empty seats. others simply hit the floor  with backpacks and jackets as makeshift pillows and blankets. the overnight movies were complemented by the soft buzz of snoring  and the silence between lines was occasionally punctured by the pop of a particularly loud snort  which drew a chuckle from the bleary-eyed souls who were still awake. when daylight broke  not that we could see it  and before doctor strange began at 10 a.m.  some of us ventured out for coffee and bagels. we ate them in the lobby because the auditorium had taken on the distinct smell of day-old body odor  stale popcorn and old socks. as we ate  legends of the night were shared  of people who sneaked into empty theaters elsewhere in the multiplex and caught hours of uninterrupted sleep. the rest of us  cramped in our seats all night with our neck pillows  kicked ourselves for not thinking creatively. by the time infinity war was on deck  28 hours in  the excitement was palpable. when the 3d seemed to be misaligned during the unwanted trailers  i was genuinely worried there was going to be a riot. a raucous fix it! fix it chant filled the room before the image was quickly repaired. when the film came to its surprisingly emotional climax  i realized how much its outcome had been augmented by the experience wed had over the previous 30-plus hours  a community binge-watch  of the most expensive  expansive and culturally dominant series of our time  and arriving at a jaw-dropping cliffhanger. and the marvel cinematic universe is uniquely suited for our binge-watch culture: with its recurring characters  multimovie story lines  copious easter eggs  and interlocking post-credit puzzle pieces  it demands that fans consume it all. well  almost all. the series has now grown so expansive that six films were excluded from this years marathon; had every title been shown  it would have run something like 48 hours. in the homestretch  i asked my friends on the floor if that two-day commitment would have dissuaded them. i wouldve still been here  ms. lugardo said without hesitation. i wouldve slept through more of the movies. but yeah  id be here. advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by julie hirschfeld davis and eileen sullivanmarch 21  2018  washington — president trump defended on wednesday his decision to disregard the advice of his national security team and congratulate president vladimir v. putin of russia on his re-election  lashing out at the news media for reporting on how he diverged from his script and attacking his predecessors for failing to improve relations with moscow. mr. trump  enraged after officials leaked the contents of confidential notes he was given for the private phone call on tuesday that exhorted him “do not congratulate” mr. putin  argued in a pair of tweets on wednesday afternoon that the conversation was part of his effort to foster better relations with russia. he said such engagement could help the united states confront a host of national security challenges. “i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past  obama called him also) ” mr. trump wrote on twitter  referring to president barack obama’s call to mr. putin in 2012. “the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. they are wrong!” but mr. trump’s handling of the call and his defense of it also pointed up his aversion to confronting mr. putin about moscow’s misdeeds  which has become a theme of his presidency even as a special counsel investigates russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in his favor. advertisement mr. trump’s own advisers had warned him against congratulating mr. putin and  in briefing cards prepared before the call  told him to raise moscow’s role in a nerve agent attack on a former russian spy and his daughter living in britain  an instruction he also ignored. the washington post first reported on the briefing cards  a leak that stunned some senior officials at the white house  where aides said on wednesday that john f. kelly  the chief of staff  had been deeply disappointed and frustrated by the disclosure. advertisement one senior white house official said mr. trump had never seen the briefing cards. another said the president had been determined not to antagonize mr. putin  believing that his rapport with the russian leader was the key to better relations between the countries. it was that rationale that mr. trump appeared to embrace on wednesday. “getting along with russia (and others) is a good thing  not a bad thing ” the president wrote. “they can help solve problems with north korea  syria  ukraine  isis  iran and even the coming arms race.” the president also took on his predecessors  both republican and democrat  saying they had been incapable of forging better relations with moscow. “bush tried to get along  but didn’t have the ‘smarts ’” mr. trump wrote. “obama and clinton tried  but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember reset).” he was referring to the policy of hillary clinton  his 2016 campaign rival  who as secretary of state in mr. obama’s administration pursued a “reset” with russia aimed at turning around a dysfunctional relationship.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the call revived questions about mr. trump’s stance toward mr. putin just after his administration had taken its most aggressive steps against moscow  moving last week to impose sanctions for russia’s interference in the election and other “malicious cyberattacks.” the united states also joined britain  france and germany in denouncing the russian government for violating international law for the attack on the spy  sergei v. skripal  and his daughter  yulia. still  since his first face-to-face meeting with mr. putin over the summer  mr. trump has consistently refused to criticize the russian president directly. in november  after a meeting with mr. putin on the sideline of the asia pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in danang  vietnam  mr. trump said the russian president “means it” when he denied having meddled in the 2016 election  and was “very insulted by” the charge  which is the conclusion of american intelligence agencies. advertisement mr. trump began his day on wednesday indirectly criticizing robert s. mueller iii  the special counsel  for the russia investigation  continuing to attack him by name against the advice of his own lawyers. “i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council ” mr. trump wrote on twitter in quotes he attributed to alan m. dershowitz  a professor emeritus at harvard law school. “i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime  collusion or otherwise  or obstruction of justice!” it was not immediately clear on wednesday which remarks of mr. dershowitz’s the president was quoting. an interview with mr. dershowitz on fox news on tuesday and an opinion piece by mr. dershowitz published on wednesday did not include the exact phrasing that mr. trump used in his tweets. and the language was not found in a search of mr. dershowitz’s cable news appearances over the past week. justin bank and emily cochrane contributed reporting. a version of this article appears in print on march 22  2018  on page a15 of the new york

politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by robert leonard mr. leonard lives in marion county  iowa  and is the news director for the radio stations knia and krls. knoxville  iowa — donald trump won over 60 percent of the 2016 vote in rural iowa  where i live  and i haven’t heard much concern from republicans over the president’s alleged infidelities with a porn actress  his ties to russia or jared kushner’s real estate shenanigans. or  for that matter  much concern about the administration scandals about wife beaters  saudi princes  ben carson’s table or scott pruitt’s soundproof room. many people don’t even know these scandals exist — they generally don’t lead in sean hannity’s or tucker carlson’s world. sure  there is a little rumbling about the increased deficit  but not much. besides  it’s the fault of congress  in particular the democrats. but people here — republicans and democrats alike — are paying great attention to what president trump is doing economically  especially since he started in on tariffs. we have a strong manufacturing base in our county; when tariffs on aluminum and steel were announced  local manufacturing leaders tried to be diplomatic  praising the trump tax cuts but saying the steel and aluminum tariffs would hurt their businesses by driving costs up. one smaller manufacturer — a trump voter — told me that his costs to produce his product nearly doubled overnight  and that his business has already been hurt by the tariffs. prices didn’t rise only after the tariffs were announced; they started rising when mr. trump floated the idea. but it’s the farm economy that rural iowans are paying particular attention to. when the president first proposed a 20 percent import tax on mexico to pay for his wall  iowans objected: mexico is our second-largest export partner after canada. mr. trump has waffled on the renewable fuel standard before — ethanol is big around here — and iowa’s entire congressional delegation and the governor’s office pressured him to renew it. we know he will waffle again  and potentially end it. most recently  when mr. trump imposed $60 billion in tariffs and sanctions against china  the iowa soybean association said his action “poses an immediate and grave threat to their industry and iowa agriculture.” senator joni ernst and iowa’s agriculture secretary  mike naig  both say the tariffs will hurt iowans  and mr. naig says we need to expand markets  not shrink them. senator chuck grassley said something similar  on fox news: “tariffs do not put america first — low barriers and expanded access do.” china has already responded with its own tariff on pork  which will have a dire impact on iowa. iowa is the nation’s largest pork producer  producing three times as much pork as the next-highest state. a couple of banker friends who work with farmers every day told me last week that with commodity prices down and the tariffs imposed  approximately 10 percent of our farmers probably won’t make it this year  and 10 percent more will likely fail next year. they also shared the news that in iowa  larger agribusinesses are buying up smaller farms that are in financial trouble  and that people are starting to make comparisons to the farm crisis of the 1980s  when approximately 10 000 iowa farmers lost their farms. even representative steve king  the avid trump supporter and iowan every liberal loves to hate  is worried about a new farm crisis. dairy farmers are particularly hard hit  suffering through four years of declining prices. it’s gotten so bad  dairy farming organizations are giving out suicide hotline numbers  as farmers are committing suicide in the hope that their insurance will save the family farm. i’m focusing on the area i know  rural iowa  but if the president stays on course with the tariffs  the impacts will hit many rural areas all over america  what i call trumplandia. “it gives democrats a generational opportunity to do the political work with farmers they haven’t done since the 1980s farm crisis ” said matt russell  a rural sociologist and farmer in iowa. “democrats do farm policy really well but are terrible at farm politics. republicans do farm politics really well but have a history of doing terrible farm policy.” harvest will be coming in when members of congress  in recess  return to iowa to campaign. they will be getting earfuls from rural constituents about the economic impacts of mr. trump’s tariffs. the president’s position is actually quite precarious. he’s already at a historic low approval rating. with the multiple scandals  rampant corruption and the mueller investigation  the only thing keeping him near 40 percent approval — and most important  approval among most republicans — is a strong economy. that  and fox cheerleading. but if he tanks the rural economy  he and his legacy are in deep trouble. furthermore  if the rural economy turns sour  much of rural america will abandon mr. trump  and fox may have no choice but to follow. then it’s just a matter of time before they will turn with the hope that a trump impeachment and a pence presidency will save the economy  the conservative gains that have been made under trump  and the republican party. they’ll believe that they have no choice  and it will be swift and ruthless. robert leonard is the news director for the radio stations knia and krls. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by maggie haberman and michael s. schmidtmarch 10  2018  president trump is in discussions with a veteran washington lawyer who represented bill clinton during the impeachment process about joining the white house to help deal with the special counsel inquiry  according to four people familiar with the matter. the lawyer  emmet t. flood  met with mr. trump in the oval office this past week to discuss the possibility  according to the people. no final decision has been made  according to two of the people. should mr. flood come on board  the two people said  his main duties would be a day-to-day role helping the president navigate his dealings with the justice department. two people close to the president said that the overture to mr. flood did not indicate any new concerns about the inquiry. still  it appears  at the least  to be an acknowledgment that the investigation is unlikely to end anytime soon. advertisement mr. flood would not replace ty cobb  the white house lawyer who since the summer has taken the lead role in dealing with the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii. but mr. cobb has told friends for weeks that he views his position as temporary and does not expect to remain in the job for much longer. advertisement mr. cobb’s primary task — producing documents for mr. mueller and arranging for white house aides to meet with prosecutors — is largely complete. mr. trump’s personal lawyers have been handling negotiations with mr. mueller over the terms of a presidential interview. mr. flood had been on the wish list of some of the president’s advisers to join his legal team last year  and he is the only person the white house has been in contact with about such a leading role. white house officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. mr. flood declined to comment. this is not the first time that the president’s advisers have considered a job for mr. flood  who worked in the white house counsel’s office under george w. bush and represented vice president dick cheney. as recently as the summer  mr. flood  who currently works at the law firm williams & connolly  turned down an opportunity to represent mr. trump. it is not clear what has changed since then.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. people close to mr. trump have long praised mr. cobb as having a deft touch with an often mercurial president. throughout last year  mr. cobb kept mr. trump from publicly airing grievances against mr. mueller in part by telling him that the investigation would be wrapped up by december  or soon after — an assessment that proved too optimistic. but there have been signs in recent months that mr. trump may be looking to shake up his legal team and change his approach to mr. mueller’s investigation. the president has polled his advisers and friends  asking them what they think of mr. cobb  who persuaded mr. trump to take a cooperative approach to the inquiry. in private conversations  mr. trump has seesawed between expressing confidence in mr. cobb’s claim that the inquiry will wrap up in relatively short order and that he will be exonerated  and sounding frustrated with his team’s legal strategy. advertisement mr. cobb has clashed with the white house counsel  donald f. mcgahn ii  who believed that mr. cobb was too willing to hand over documents to mr. mueller when the white house could have shielded them by citing executive or attorney-client privilege. officials familiar with the discussions with mr. flood said they were unrelated to tensions between mr. mcgahn and mr. cobb. it is not clear what a shake-up would mean for john dowd and jay sekulow  the two lawyers outside the white house who have also represented mr. trump since the summer. mr. dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing incidents  including one in which he wrote a tweet for mr. trump that raised new questions about whether the president had tried to obstruct the investigation into his former national security adviser  michael t. flynn. one person close to the president who has urged him to dismiss mr. cobb and mr. dowd has been the fox news personality jeanine pirro. ms. pirro  a personal friend of mr. trump’s and a former westchester county district attorney  told mr. trump in an oval office visit months ago that mr. cobb and mr. dowd were leading him down a path toward his demise. other advisers have urged the

politics,advertisement by matt apuzzomarch 17  2018  washington — andrew g. mccabe  the former deputy f.b.i. director who was fired late friday  kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with president trump and his conversations with the former director james b. comey  a person close to mr. mccabe said on saturday. the memos could bolster the account of mr. comey  whose own memos and testimony describe repeated requests by mr. trump to clear his name. mr. comey said mr. trump also asked him to shut down a criminal investigation into his former national security adviser  michael t. flynn. both matters are under investigation by the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii  who is considering whether mr. trump tried to obstruct justice. mr. mccabe’s memos were left at the f.b.i.  which means that mr. mueller’s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate mr. comey’s account. mr. trump has denied pressuring mr. comey to end the flynn investigation. mr. comey was fired last spring  and the revelation of his conversations with mr. trump helped lead to the special counsel’s appointment. mr. mccabe is known to have had at least three meetings with the president. in one  he asked mr. mccabe how he had voted in the presidential election. in each  he asked about mr. mccabe’s wife  jill  who ran a failed campaign as a democrat for the virginia state senate. mr. mccabe has identified as a lifelong republican but did not vote in the 2016 presidential race. advertisement the existence of his memos was first reported by the associated press. mr. mccabe was fired less than two days before his retirement. attorney general jeff sessions cited what he said was a lack of candor by mr. mccabe in interviews with internal investigators. his firing had been recommended by career disciplinary officials at the f.b.i. advertisement mr. mccabe immediately declared that his firing was part of a trump administration effort to discredit him and damage the special counsel’s investigation. in an interview  he said he had not made false statements. “this is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness ” he said.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. he was among the first f.b.i. officials to scrutinize possible trump campaign ties to russia. mr. trump has taunted mr. mccabe both publicly and privately  and republican allies of the president have cast mr. mccabe as the center of a “deep state” effort to undermine the trump presidency. his lawyer  michael r. bromwich  said justice department officials had rushed to fire mr. mccabe before he could qualify for his pension. “this distortion of the process begins at the very top  with the president’s repeated offensive  drive-by twitter attacks on mr. mccabe ” mr. bromwich said late friday. mr. trump kept up his twitter barrage on saturday  pointing to hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to ms. mccabe’s campaign from a political committee run by terry mcauliffe  the former virginia governor and a longtime ally of the clintons.              the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught  called out and fired. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by crooked h friend  terry m  who was also under investigation? how many lies? how many leaks? comey knew it all  and much more!         the president’s personal lawyer seemed to lend credence saturday to the idea that mr. mccabe and mr. mueller were linked in the eyes of the president. asked by the daily beast for a response to mr. mccabe’s firing  the lawyer  john dowd  sent an email saying it was now time that the special counsel investigation be shut down. we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more » go to home page » 
politics,advertisement by peter bakermarch 14  2018  st. louis — britain’s tough response in holding russia responsible for a poisoning attack on its soil increased the pressure on president trump to join with a nato ally in taking action  even as he has been reluctant to retaliate for moscow’s intervention in the 2016 election in the united states. mr. trump  who was visiting missouri on wednesday  has not personally addressed the attack since london assigned blame to russia and left it instead to aides to express public solidarity with prime minister theresa may after she expelled 23 russian diplomats  canceled high-level contacts and vowed to impose more sanctions. “this latest action by russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which russia disregards the international rules-based order  undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide  and attempts to subvert and discredit western democratic institutions and processes ” the white house said in a written statement. “the united states is working together with our allies and partners to ensure that this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again.” but for whatever reason  mr. trump avoided saying so personally in public  much as he has generally avoided condemning russia for its election meddling. he has allowed top advisers to denounce moscow for its interference in american democracy  but when it comes to his own twitter posts or comments  he has largely stuck to equivocal language  seemingly reluctant to accept the consensus conclusion of his intelligence agencies and intent on voicing no outrage or criticism of president vladimir v. putin of russia  for whom he has expressed admiration. advertisement instead  through early evening  mr. trump used his twitter feed to focus on issues like trade  infrastructure  school safety and his complaints that senate democrats are obstructing confirmation of his nominees. his only public comments during the day came at a boeing plant where he talked about tax cuts. advertisement critics of both parties pressed the president to speak out personally and possibly take action to back up mrs. may. “where prime minister may has taken bold and decisive initial action to combat russian aggression  our own president has waffled and demurred ” said senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader. “prime minister may’s decision to expel the russian diplomats is the level of response that many americans have been craving from our own administration.” senator ben sasse  republican of nebraska  said the united states should consult with nato allies about “a collective response ” including the possibility of expelling russian diplomats from washington and other alliance capitals or freezing more russian assets. “we ought to make it inescapably clear to russia that its shadow war will be met with a coordinated response ” he said. evelyn farkas  a former pentagon official who oversaw russia policy under president barack obama  said mr. trump should offer a range of assistance to britain to help investigate the episode  prevent further such attacks on british sovereignty and impose punishment. she added that the united states could cite the suspicious death of mikhail y. lesin  a former russian minister  in a washington hotel in 2015  in taking joint action. investigators concluded that he died from a drunken fall but many remain skeptical. “frankly  i believe we should have and could still do this in response to russia’s election interference in the united states and several other nato countries ” she said. “we certainly should craft additional sanctions together with the u.k. and the e.u. to address the assassinations.” until tuesday night  the white house had avoided pointing the finger at russia for the attack  in which a former russian spy was poisoned with a nerve agent near his home in southern england.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. at her briefing on monday  sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary  condemned the attack without publicly agreeing with britain’s assessment that russia was behind it. the administration’s only tough comment on russian involvement until tuesday came from secretary of state rex w. tillerson  but he has since been fired. mr. trump and ms. may then talked by phone on tuesday night  and the white house issued a statement expressing his solidarity with her. the british readout of the call attributed stronger language to mr. trump than his own white house statement did  reporting that during their conversation  “president trump said the u.s. was with the u.k. all the way.” advertisement by wednesday morning  lower-level american officials joined in backing britain as it retaliated against russia. “russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the united kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent ” nikki r. haley  the ambassador to the united nations  said at an emergency security council session  calling the poisoning “an atrocious crime.” that did not satisfy those who said the president should show personal leadership. “judgment day for donald trump ” r. nicholas burns  a former ambassador to nato and an under secretary of state under president george w. bush  wrote on twitter. “will he support britain unequivocally on the nerve agent attack? back #nato sanctions? finally criticize putin? act like a leader of the west?” mr. trump has at times grudgingly accepted that russia meddled in the 2016 election but usually sounds more determined to rebut any suspicions that his campaign colluded with moscow or that whatever meddling took place helped him win. he has opted against imposing sanctions beyond those already imposed by mr. obama despite a new law passed overwhelmingly authorizing further penalties. asked about the meddling last week  after robert s. mueller iii  the special counsel  indicted 13 russians for spreading disinformation and propaganda in a concerted effort to influence the election  mr. trump focused on whether it changed the result  and avoided strong words about moscow. “well  the russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever ” he said during a news conference with sweden’s prime minister. “but certainly there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals. and i think you have to be really watching very closely. you don’t want your system of votes to be compromised in any way. and we won’t allow that to happen.” raj shah  a white house spokesman  said on wednesday that the president took the election meddling seriously and had ordered his administration to take steps to prevent it from happening again. when asked if the president would eventually opt for retaliation in addition to prevention  mr. shah implied that mr. trump already had  but in secret. “there are steps that i’m talking about that we can talk about ” he said. “then there are steps that we can’t talk about publicly but that our adversaries know that we are engaged in.”

politics,advertisement by simon schamamarch 26  2018  (((semitism))) being jewish in america in the age of trump by jonathan weisman 238 pp. st. martin’s press. $25.99. come november’s midterm elections  the republican candidate for the third congressional district of illinois will be a nazi. there is nothing neo about arthur jones. not just a white supremacist  not merely a foot soldier of the alt-right  jones is the sort of full-on  unreconstructed  holocaust-denying (“the blackest lie in history”)  hitler-worshiping  blood-and-soil warrior for whom the jews are the root of all evil. don’t panic. he will lose the election in an overwhelmingly democratic district  but it is precisely that assumed outcome which seemed to have persuaded local republicans not to bother opposing him in the march 20 primary. waking up to the result of their indifference they belatedly repudiated jones. but it might have occurred to them that the mere fact of his appearance on the ballot as the republican candidate is itself a shocking affront not just to jews but to all the norms of american political decency. then again  those norms right now are shifting sand. the sick joke of jones’s candidacy doesn’t feature in jonathan weisman’s “(((semitism))) ” but every other kind of monstrously reawakened zombie-nazi madness does  especially those swarming and multiplying in the digital dung heap. his book is largely a report from consternation nation  and its longest chapter chronicles the rise of white supremacist aggression  on and off the web. he has been on the sharp end of trolling storms and knows what it feels like (as do i) to have yourself photoshopped with concentration camp stripes or with your head in an oven. but in the end weisman is unsure how much of an actual and immediate danger this online abuse represents. for all of the website bile and the tiki-torch marches  “the threat of violence against jews ” he writes  “has not materialized into actual violence ” especially in comparison with hate crimes committed against african-americans and muslims. he quotes the anti-defamation league’s jonathan greenblatt saying that “the number of americans that hold anti-semitic beliefs has decreased dramatically.” but of course it is the advent of trumpian politics — its nonstop carnival of paranoia; its scapegoating of hispanics and african-americans; its anti-immigrant phobia — that has rung weisman’s alarm bells  which accounts for his subtitle: “being jewish in america in the age of trump.” more sinister for him than the foaming lunacies of the neo-nazis is the alt-right’s embrace of conspiracy theorists; the routine mutation of fantasy into fact; the appetite for seeing secret hands (george soros for instance) at work in plots to undermine america — all of which have a whiff of late weimar about them  not to mention the long history of populist anti-semitism in the united states. better  weisman believes  to be fretfully vigilant than torpidly complacent. in one of the 1940s movie-poster homilies he favors (“the world is watching ” “the nation gasped”)  he warns that while “unheard thunder” was rumbling  “the jews slept.” but this reduction of “being jewish” to a state of hair-tearing anxiety about the surge of anti-semitism means weisman never quite delivers on his subtitle’s promise. a richly researched and nuanced account of jewish life in stressed-out  polarized america would be timely  but this isn’t it. instead  weisman takes a chapter to complain about what he considers the major distraction preventing american jews from being fully alert to the perils of the time — but this  a little surprisingly  turns out to be “israel  israel  israel.” it is not clear whether he thinks the aipac herd mentality  so elated at gestures like the embassy move to jerusalem  blinkers jews to the threat that trump and trumpism represent to the liberal culture he champions. or whether he believes that increasingly abrasive debates dividing the jewish community about the occupation of the west bank and the expansion of settlements are the greater problem. weisman reports with understandable pain his demonization by hard-liners as a self-hating jewish traitor for daring to point out  in a times infographic  which opponents of the iranian nuclear deal were jewish. but such bitter arguments have gone on for a while and it seems odd to suppose that engagement with the trials and tribulations of israel somehow precludes engaging with diaspora anti-semitism  as if jews of all people have a finite capacity for attentiveness. anti-semitism and the existence of israel are hardly historically disconnected. advertisement the second malaise weisman identifies as blunting jewish alertness to the peril of the times is the hollowing out of a jewish identity that is neither uncritically zionist nor devoutly religious. “the jews who are most interested in a liberal  internationalist future  who wish to live progressive  assimilated existences free of threat ” he warns  “are disappearing.” but his sense of the tradition he believes is being lost is romantically wishful. in a hasty drive through jewish history he nominates moses maimonides and moses mendelssohn as embodying this outward-looking nontribal judaism. but the two moseses were intensely devout and at times darkly pessimistic about the prospects of a jewish life in a non-jewish world. advertisement it is true nonetheless  as weisman points out  that a considerable majority of americans identifying as jews do so by way of remembering the holocaust or being engaged with the fate of israel rather than anything much rooted in judaism and jewish history. weisman confesses he isn’t “much into davening” and reckons that even efforts to introduce more hebrew into the reform liturgy is a matter of simply “going through the motions ” ultimately more impediment than inspiration. but if “being jewish” means nothing more than an ethically attuned solidarity with kindred disadvantaged at home and abroad  then the reawakening he wants will just evaporate in a cloud of airy good will. being jewish is knowing jewish history in some depth; being jewish is engaging with the incomparable treasury of disputation that is the talmud; being jewish is immersion in the boundless glories of jewish literature  poetry  philosophy and art. it’s this broad-minded debate-conscious kind of jewish life that weisman worries is moribund. but it may be too soon to write its obituary. annual limmud retreats  which offer a festival of learning and discussion on all things truly or even notionally jewish  are thriving in britain and increasingly in america. jewish journalism in magazines like moment and tablet alongside reinvigorated institutions like the forward and the british jewish quarterly review seems to be entering something of a golden age. in london  jw3 — since its opening in a spankingly smart modern building — has become a magnet of cultural energy  and jewish book week (also in london) draws packed houses (and not exclusively jewish audiences) to its offerings in early march. and if it is acts of solidarity weisman wants (those have never really gone away) he might note that the home page of the american jewish world service for purim featured a photograph of a rohingya refugee. none of this is to make light of the sinister anti-semitic strain in the ascendancy of alt-right ideology. there are plenty of signs that jew-hatred is pushing through the soft walls of ultraright politics and poisoning its bloodstream. there is nothing wrong  as weisman counsels  with jews standing shoulder to shoulder with those most damaged and threatened by tribalist populism  as jews like abraham joshua heschel did in the heyday of the civil rights movement. ultimately  though  what is needed is an aggressive defense of those things that not so long ago could be taken for granted in america  and under which jewish life has prospered to a degree unique in the world: the integrity of the democratic process  the protections of the constitution and the preservation of the ideal of a “nation of immigrants ” a phrase just deleted from the immigration service’s mission statement. and a little davening now and then wouldn’t do any harm. simon schama is the author  most recently  of the second volume of “the story of the jews.” follow new york times books on facebook and twitter  sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar. and listen to us on the book review podcast. a version of this review appears in print on april 1  2018  on page br12 of the sunday book review with the headline: bad for the jews.  today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. we earn an affiliate commission with each book purchase  which helps support our journalism at the new york times. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement supported by by michelle goldberg last may  mitch landrieu  the mayor of new orleans  delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the trump era without once deigning to mention the president’s name. he spoke after new orleans pulled down four confederate monuments  the culmination of a ferocious two-year political fight that included threats  armed right-wing protesters and a car being firebombed. all around the country  there was a bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason  most erected by white supremacists decades after the civil war. much of this debate  like our politics in general since november 2016  focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their history was being taken from them. so it was moving to hear a white southern politician — a bluff  broad-shouldered guy who looks like a football coach in an inspirational hollywood movie — try to see the statues from the perspective of his city’s african-american majority. in the second decade of the 21st century  landrieu said  “asking african-americans — or anyone else for that matter — to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person’s humanity seems perverse. it seems absurd.” he argued that a city is entitled to choose whom it venerates. “unlike when these confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy  we now have a chance to create not only new symbols  but to do it together  as one people ” he said. it may be a sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of landrieu as a potential presidential contender. that chatter has only picked up with the publication of landrieu’s new book  “in the shadow of statues: a white southerner confronts history.” in politico  donna brazile and james carville were recently quoted cheering him on; carville described him as a talent on the scale of bill clinton or barack obama. when i spoke to landrieu in new york recently  he insisted he wasn’t laying the groundwork for a campaign and didn’t see a niche for himself in what will likely be a crowded field. of course  that’s not quite a denial. i have no idea if he’d have a chance; i suspect he’s far too much of a centrist for most democratic primary voters. (he certainly is for me.) still  i’m glad to see him celebrated  because he’s done something  in his speech and his book  that other politicians should emulate. he’s tried to reckon with america’s sins while offering an optimistic  big-hearted and deeply patriotic defense of cosmopolitanism as the source of american greatness. american identity has always been contested  but for several decades before donald trump became president  there were areas of broad concord  ideas so widely accepted they were either invisible or cliché. politicians from both parties called america a nation of immigrants. the latin phrase “e pluribus unum” — out of many  one — was treated as a de facto national motto. almost everyone in public life spoke of the emma lazarus poem mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty — “give me your tired  your poor  / your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”— with reverence. racist demagogy obviously existed in our politics  but overt white nationalism was confined to the fringes. drawing on darker  older strains of american history  trump has systematically attacked this post-civil-rights-era consensus. it’s one reason his presidency feels to many of us like such an existential assault. in defending confederate statues  trump has inveighed against removing historical symbols. yet his administration is promiscuous in trashing the symbols of diversity. indeed  for all his buffoonish ignorance  the power of symbols is something trump understands far better than most politicians. under trump  the united states citizenship and immigration services has removed language from its mission statement about securing “america’s promise as a nation of immigrants.” on the presidential coin — which presidents hand out as mementos — “e pluribus unum” has been replaced by “make america great again.” stephen miller  an influential trump adviser  dismissed lazarus’s poem as something that “was added later and was not part of the original statue of liberty.” the changes in american life under trump  of course  aren’t just symbolic. several metrics show increases in hate crimes. (brian levin  director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university  san bernardino  told me that there were more hate crimes in november 2016 than in any november since federal record-keeping began in 1992.) white supremacy has become both more open and more mainstream: the fox news host tucker carlson does segments decrying demographic change and warning about an influx of unhygienic “gypsies.” landrieu  the mayor of a city beloved for its hybrid  polyglot culture  is pushing back against this tide. in his book  he writes about serving in the state legislature alongside david duke  the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan  whom he sees as a predecessor to trump. he describes the way many louisiana republicans  aware of duke’s popularity with their own voters  failed to take him on  leaving a “sinister spectacle” in which truth was lost. it taught him  he writes  about the need to confront bigotry and pull it up from the root: “there is no other way forward.” trying to move forward and honor the diverse history of his city has cost landrieu. though people float his name for president  his stance on the confederate monuments has probably made him unelectable to any statewide office. (one 2016 poll showed that 88 percent of white louisianians opposed the monuments’ removal). “i’m not a hero  and i’m not particularly a courageous person ” he told me. “but at some point you have to be willing to lose your job to do the right thing. that’s the only time you really find freedom.” in these bleak times  it’s a lesson many others in public life should heed. i invite you to follow me on twitter (@michelleinbklyn) and join me on facebook. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by by michelle goldberg three months ago  the washington post reported that even as donald trump ran for president  he pursued plans to build a trump tower in moscow. the next day  the new york times published excerpts from emails between felix sater  a felon with ties to russian organized crime  and michael cohen  one of donald trump’s lawyers and sater’s childhood friend  about the project. sater was apparently an intermediary between trump and russia  and in a nov. 3  2015  email to cohen  he made the strange argument that a successful deal would lead to trump’s becoming president. boasting that he was close enough to vladimir putin to let ivanka trump sit in the russian president’s desk chair  sater wrote  “i will get putin on this program and we will get donald elected.” these stories were  at the time  bombshells. at a minimum  they showed that trump was lying when he said  repeatedly  that he had “nothing to do with russia.” further  sater’s logic — that putin’s buy-in on a real estate deal would result in trump’s election — was bizarre  suggesting that some part of the proposed collaboration was left unsaid. but three months feels like three decades in trump years  and i mostly forgot about these reports until i read luke harding’s new book  “collusion: secret meetings  dirty money  and how russia helped donald trump win.” one uncanny aspect of the investigations into trump’s russia connections is that instead of too little evidence there’s too much. it’s impossible to keep it straight without the kind of chaotic wall charts that carrie mathison of “homeland” assembled during her manic episodes. incidents that would be major scandals in a normal administration — like the mere fact of trump’s connection to sater — become minor subplots in this one. that’s why “collusion” is so essential  and why i wish everyone who is skeptical that russia has leverage over trump would read it. this country — at least the parts not wholly under the sway of right-wing propaganda — needs to come to terms with substantial evidence that the president is in thrall to a foreign power. harding  the former moscow bureau chief of the guardian  has been reporting on shady characters like paul manafort  the former trump campaign chairman who was indicted last month  long before trump announced his candidacy. he was able to interview christopher steele  the former british spy who wrote the dossier attempting to detail trump’s relationship with the kremlin  and who describes the conspiracy between the american president and the russians as “massive — absolutely massive.” “collusion” doesn’t purport to solve all the mysteries of this alleged conspiracy. there’s no longer any serious question that there was cooperation between trump’s campaign and russia  but the extent of the cooperation  and the precise nature of it  remains opaque. harding makes a strong case for steele’s credibility  but steele reportedly said that the raw intelligence in his dossier is only 70 percent to 90 percent accurate  so it’s hard to know which parts of it to believe. but harding’s book is invaluable in collating the overwhelming evidence of a web of relationships between the kremlin  trump and members of trump’s circle. he suggests  convincingly  that russia may have been cultivating trump since the 1980s. at that time  harding writes  the k.g.b. was working to draw “prominent figures in the west” — as the k.g.b. described them — into collaboration. according to harding  a form for evaluating targets asked  “are pride  arrogance  egoism  ambition or vanity among subject’s natural characteristics?” last week  the times reported that many russian critics of putin deplore america’s fixation on moscow’s role in the election  since it reinforces putin’s image of himself as an “ever-victorious master strategist” controlling world affairs. the article quoted ivan kurilla  a russian historian and america expert: “american liberals are so upset about trump that they cannot believe he is a real product of american life. they try to portray him as something created by russia.” as one of those american liberals  i don’t think this is quite right. trump  the gaudy huckster who treats closing a sale as the height of human endeavor  is a quintessentially american figure. his campaign of racial and religious grievance drew on the darkest currents of american history. at most  putin appears to have recognized an opportunity that american political dysfunction created. it’s a sign of how deep that dysfunction goes that the substantial evidence that the president is not a patriot hasn’t caused more of a political earthquake. america  stunned and divided  appears incapable of metabolizing all we’re learning about the man in the white house. yes  we have investigations  but the business of government plods on; right now the senate is working on the roy moore of tax bills  a piece of legislation that magnifies right-wing pathologies into a cartoonish grotesque. it wasn’t putin who fashioned a republican party willing to tolerate something close to treason if it’s the price of corporate tax cuts. even if all the republicans in congress read harding’s book  they probably wouldn’t act. but at least they’d know what they’re abetting. i invite you to follow me on twitter (@michelleinbklyn) and join me on facebook. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by by paul krugman almost four decades have passed since daniel patrick moynihan famously declared  “of a sudden  the g.o.p. has become a party of ideas.” and his statement still holds true  with one modification: these days  republicans are a party of zombie ideas — ideas that should have died long ago  yet still keep shambling along  eating politicians’ brains. the most important of these zombies is the “supply side” insistence that cutting taxes on the rich reliably produces economic miracles  and conversely that raising taxes on the rich is a recipe for disaster. faith in this doctrine survived the boom that followed bill clinton’s tax hikes  the lackluster recovery and eventual catastrophe that followed george w. bush’s tax cuts  the debacle in kansas  and more. and donald trump’s selection of larry kudlow to head the national economic council confirms that the tax-cut zombie is undead and well. for kudlow is a fervent believer in the infinite virtues of tax cuts  despite a track record of predictions based on that belief that  as new york magazine’s jonathan chait once wrote  “has elevated flamboyant wrongness to a form of performance art.” yet there is more to economic policy than taxes; trump himself  while willing to sign whatever tax cuts congress sends him  seems far more interested in international policy  in particular the supposed evils of trade deficits. and that’s where things get interesting. you see  now that “globalists” like gary cohn have left  all the people advising trump on international economics are  like those advising him on everything else  in thrall to zombie ideas. but there’s more than one kind of zombie. in fact  there are in effect two factions — equally wrong  but wrong in different  almost opposite ways. you might say that when it comes to international trade  trumpworld is heading for a kind of zombie civil war. on one side  we have the neo-mercantilists — people like peter navarro  trump’s trade czar — who see world trade as a tale of winners and losers: countries with trade surpluses win; those with trade deficits lose. both logic and history say that this view is nonsense: trade surpluses are often a sign of weakness  trade deficits sometimes a sign of strength (as a matter of arithmetic  a country that attracts more inward investment from foreigners than it invests abroad must run a trade deficit). and the neo-mercantilists have a habit of making crude errors  like misunderstanding how value-added taxes work. still  they have trump’s ear  because the rocks in their heads fit the holes in his: they’re telling him what he wants to hear  because their errors play to his gut instincts  and when it comes to policy  he don’t need no education. yet they’re not the only faction talking dangerous nonsense on international economics. the trump administration has also become home to what we might call neo-goldbugs: people who think that a nation’s strength can be measured by the strength of its currency  and refuse to see any downside in a strong dollar  never see any reason a weaker dollar might be needed. like neo-mercantilism  or for that matter supply-side economics  this view has been debunked many times — i wrote about it in 1987! — yet keeps shambling along  because it appeals to the prejudices of wealthy and powerful people. until now  the most visible neo-goldbug in the administration has been david malpass  the under secretary of treasury for international affairs — normally a position of great policy influence  although under trump  who knows? malpass is the former chief economist of bear stearns  and a man with a kudlow-like record of being wrong about everything. in particular  however  back in 2011 malpass published an op-ed article declaring that what america needed to fix its economic ills was a stronger dollar (and higher interest rates). it was a bizarre claim. after all  at the time the unemployment rate was still 9 percent — and a stronger dollar would have made things even worse. why? because it would have made u.s. products less competitive  increasing the trade deficit — and a situation of persistently high unemployment is the one situation in which trade deficits really are an unambiguously bad thing  reducing the demand for domestic goods and services. but here’s the thing: kudlow appears to share malpass’s worldview. in fact  his first newsworthy statement after trump announced his selection was a call for a higher dollar — something that would worsen the very trade deficit trump sees as a sign of american weakness. why has trump hired people with such conflicting notions about international economic policy? the answer  presumably  is that he doesn’t understand the issues well enough to realize that the conflict exists. and what both sides in this dispute share is a general propensity for invincible ignorance  which makes them trump’s kind of people. anyway  on international economics the trump administration is now on track for a battle of the zombies — a fight between two sets of bad ideas that refuse to die. pass the popcorn. follow me on twitter (@paulkrugman) and facebook. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  opinionthe editorial board advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by peter bakerfeb. 24  2018  washington — in a fiery speech to supporters on friday  president trump went after his vanquished opponent from 2016. “we had a crooked candidate ” he declared. the crowd responded with a signature chant from the campaign trail: “lock her up!” about three hours later and 10 miles to the north  mr. trump’s former deputy campaign chairman  who helped put him in the white house  arrived at a federal courthouse in washington to plead guilty to being crooked and face the prospect that the authorities will now lock him up. with each passing day  robert s. mueller iii  the special counsel investigating russia’s interference in the 2016 election  seems to add another brick to the case he is building — one more indictment  one more interview  one more guilty plea. mr. trump and his advisers insist they are not worried because so far none of the charges implicate the president. yet no one outside mr. mueller’s office knows for sure where he is heading and the flurry of recent action seems to be inexorably leading to a larger target. “when you put that all together  the white house should be extremely worried ” said benjamin wittes  editor in chief of lawfare  a blog that analyzes legal issues  and a friend of james b. comey  the former f.b.i. director who was leading the russia investigation until being fired by mr. trump last year. “you have to ask the question about whether there is a certain measure of self-delusion going on here.” advertisement in the last 10 days  mr. mueller has indicted 13 russians and three russian companies on suspicion of secretly trying to help mr. trump win the election  added new charges against paul manafort  who was mr. trump’s campaign chairman  and secured a guilty plea from a lawyer tied to mr. manafort’s business dealings with pro-russian figures. the guilty plea on friday by rick gates  the former deputy chairman  raised the pressure on mr. manafort. advertisement mr. trump is correct that nothing produced publicly by mr. mueller to date has claimed any wrongdoing by the president nor any illegal collaboration with the russians seeking to influence the 2016 election. the indictment of the russians — who are accused of flooding facebook and other social media with disinformation and propaganda — cited only contact with “unwitting individuals” connected with mr. trump’s campaign. the charges against mr. manafort and mr. gates depict an expansive money-laundering and fraud operation stemming from their work for ukrainian leaders aligned with moscow  not from their involvement in the campaign. michael t. flynn  the president’s former national security adviser  and george papadopoulos  a former campaign adviser  pleaded guilty to lying to the f.b.i. about their contacts with russians or intermediaries but not to criminal acts related to collusion. john m. dowd  the president’s private lawyer  pointed to mr. trump’s cooperation with the investigation as evidence that he had nothing to hide. he noted that the white house had voluntarily turned over more than 20 000 pages to mr. mueller  including documents related to mr. flynn and mr. comey  and the campaign provided 1.4 million pages. more than 20 white house officials  including eight members of the counsel’s office  voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel or congressional investigators  as did 17 campaign employees and 11 others affiliated with the campaign  he added. “i give great credit to the president for his extraordinary cooperation with the special counsel ” mr. dowd said. still  as the pileup at the courthouse indicates  allies of mr. trump acknowledged that the investigation had taken a toll. “the good news for the white house is that more than 18 months since the f.b.i. probe began  there is still no evidence of russian collusion ” said christopher ruddy  the chief executive of newsmax and a friend of mr. trump. “the bad news is that the special counsel has a scorched-earth prosecution aimed at crushing the president’s associates.” advertisement “i don’t think the president is worried about the investigation himself ” he added  “but it clearly bothers him that people are being prosecuted simply because they worked for his campaign.” inside the white house  officials expressed calm resignation on friday as mr. gates marched into the courthouse. but there was low-grade concern out of recognition that mr. gates was in a lot of meetings over a long period of time. while mr. gates joined the campaign with mr. manafort  his longtime business partner and mentor  he stayed after mr. manafort was fired. he rode on mr. trump’s campaign plane and served as liaison to the republican national committee. after the election victory  he joined the transition as a right hand to thomas j. barrack jr.  the president’s close friend who ran the inaugural operation. the fact that mr. gates was allowed to plead guilty to just two relatively lower-level charges indicated to legal experts that he must have something of value for mr. mueller. the presumption in mr. trump’s circle is that mr. gates may not have any incriminating information about the president but could be a dangerous witness against mr. manafort  who in turn could threaten mr. trump. mr. manafort participated in a meeting in june 2016 along with donald trump jr.  the candidate’s son  and jared kushner  his son-in-law  with a russian lawyer on the promise of receiving incriminating information about hillary clinton on behalf of russia’s government.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mr. manafort also reportedly offered during the campaign to give “private briefings” to oleg v. deripaska  a russian oligarch allied with president vladimir v. putin who claimed mr. manafort owed him $19 million. prosecutors are interested in learning how a republican convention platform plank on russia’s intervention in ukraine was watered down. on the other hand  mr. trump’s defenders said mr. gates’s credibility as a witness may be tainted by the fact that one of the charges he pleaded guilty to was lying to the f.b.i. even as he was negotiating his plea deal. ty cobb  the white house special counsel  has said that mr. manafort has no damaging information against mr. trump. mr. manafort insisted again on friday that he was innocent and would fight the “untrue piled up charges.” mr. trump’s argument that none of this has anything to do with him resonates with many of his supporters  who have echoed his repeated insistence that there was no collusion with russia. but being surrounded by people who are prosecuted has damaged other presidents even when they were not directly implicated. jimmy carter endured significant political damage when his confidant and budget director  bert lance  was accused of banking irregularities. even putting aside the iran-contra scandal and the monica s. lewinsky affair  ronald reagan and bill clinton were besieged by investigations of their aides unrelated to them. in reagan’s era  it became known as the “sleaze factor.” mr. clinton’s team drew the scrutiny of six independent counsels other than kenneth w. starr. advertisement in the current case  the targets so far have included not just a “coffee boy ” as mr. papadopoulos was described by an adviser to mr. trump  but the president’s top two campaign officials and national security adviser. while mr. trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against mr. manafort because they involved business dealings before the campaign  the latest indictment claims that he was scheming to defraud banks while serving as mr. trump’s chairman. moreover  it remains unclear why he volunteered to work for mr. trump’s campaign without pay at a time when he was experiencing significant financial pressure. mr. trump’s defenders have focused on questioning the original basis for the investigation  accusing the f.b.i. of misconduct in relying on an unverified dossier assembled by a former british spy hired by investigators working for mrs. clinton’s campaign. to the extent that mr. mueller is exploring whether mr. trump obstructed justice by firing mr. comey  the president’s defenders contend that under the constitution  he has the power to dismiss executive branch officials and dictate their work. they also point to testimony by mr. comey and other officials who said the investigation was not impeded. therefore  they argue  the original order appointing mr. mueller was itself invalid and should be revoked. in the meantime  they are left to interpret the clues from mr. mueller’s actions just like everyone else. david b. rivkin jr.  a former white house and justice department lawyer under reagan and president george bush  said the totality of mr. mueller’s actions still did not add up to a threat to mr. trump. “it doesn’t make sense to unfold piecemeal an indictment of russian entities and russians if you have any hope of building a collusion case. it makes no logical sense ” he said. “to me  at least  what he’s done does underscore that there’s no collusion there. that leaves him with the obstruction of justice narrative which i think is constitutionally flawed and isn’t going to go anywhere.” mr. wittes said mr. mueller’s actions could be seen as building a pyramid — establishing that there was a russian influence campaign and assembling a group of cooperating witnesses. but the special counsel has not tipped his hand yet. “the basic contours of the puzzle is that he’s constructed his actions in a way that we don’t know where it’s leading ” he said  “and that’s on purpose.” maggie haberman contributed reporting from new york. follow peter baker on twitter: @peterbakernyt a version of this news analysis appears in print on february 25  2018

politics,advertisement by katie rogers and kenneth p. vogelmarch 27  2018  washington — president trump kept a relatively low profile and did not make any public appearances on tuesday  but emerged for a rare evening trip outside the white house to meet with deep-pocketed donors at a real estate developer’s home in virginia. mr. trump  who usually prefers a steak served at his own hotel if he leaves the confines of the white house at night  traveled to the mclean  va.  home of giuseppe cecchi  according to a person with knowledge of the president’s plans. mr. cecchi is a loyalist who previously hosted mr. trump for a $10 000-a-couple fund-raising dinner in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. since arriving back in washington on sunday from his florida estate  mr. trump’s schedule showed no public appearances and he kept his usual tweeting to a minimum. he has opted instead to leave it to his aides to field questions about a continuing investigation into his campaign’s contact with russia  allegations by a pornographic actress that his lawyer paid her to stay silent about an affair  a move to expel 60 russian diplomats and his administration’s support for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. advertisement the white house declined to offer additional information about the dinner  but stressed that it was not a fund-raiser. advertisement “tonight  the president will be having dinner with a group of supporters at a private residence in virginia ” said lindsay walters  a deputy white house press secretary. “this dinner is not a fund-raiser. no funds have been solicited.” it was the second time this month that mr. trump traveled to a private home to meet with donors. financial executives  an oil billionaire and the president’s oldest son  donald trump jr.  also attended the dinner at the home of a prominent lawyer. even if no funds are raised at tuesday’s dinner  it is part of a series of events intended to cultivate donors for two groups created to back mr. trump — america first policies  a nonprofit formed to support his agenda  and america first action  a “super pac” that is supporting the campaigns of his allies and eventually his re-election campaign. the groups  which are seeking to raise $100 million this year  have hosted a series of events featuring mr. trump and top administration officials  including vice president mike pence. earlier on tuesday  mr. pence headlined an “america first” rally in fargo  n.d. “they’re trying to rally people around the tax cuts  and show how they have impacted local communities ” said dan k. eberhart  an arizona oil investor and republican donor who is an adviser to america first policies and who attended the fargo event. headed into the 2018 midterm elections  republicans are mostly facing a treacherous landscape in which they fear that mr. trump could be a liability in suburban districts.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the

dispatching administration officials into areas that mr. trump won handily in 2016  and partly by raising money from wealthy supporters to fund ads bolstering republicans. the involvement of mr. trump and mr. pence is considered a key to the fund-raising efforts of the groups. advertisement america first policies and america first action are overseen by the veteran republican operative brian o. walsh. “america first action is extremely honored to host president trump as our special guest  along with supporters and friends of our organization ” he said in a statement. “we ensure that our activities at all times remain in full compliance with the law and ethics rules.” america first action has been a popular source of income for trump loyalists  including corey lewandowski  and the president’s newly named re-election campaign manager  brad parscale. the group’s goal with the dinners is to connect supporters of mr. trump with policy leaders  and to give face time to the people who had shown the president the most support  a person with knowledge of the process said. in 2016  mr. cecchi and his wife  mercedes  also hosted donors at his home. mr. cecchi who at one point was known as the “condo king” of washington  is known for developing the watergate complex. for that event  attendees had to pay $10 000 to $100 000 for a photo opportunity with mr. trump and the chance to mingle with reince priebus  then the chairman of the republican national committee  and steven t. mnuchin  the finance chairman at the time for the trump campaign. mr. cecchi could not be reached for comment. when reached by telephone  mr. cecchi’s son john did not offer further details of the event. “whatever he’s doing ” john cecchi  who was on the host committee of the 2016 event  said of his father  “i’m sure he’s psyched about it.” maggie haberman contributed reporting. a version of this article appears in print on march 28  2018  on page a15 of the new york edition with the

politics,advertisement by kirk semplefeb. 26  2018  mexico city — a bitter struggle between a trump organization hotel business and the owners of the panama city hotel that carries the trump name escalated on monday when the panamanian authorities announced that they had begun a formal investigation into the dispute. the country’s public ministry said in a brief statement that it was looking into whether there had been any “punishable conduct” in the matter. the decision came in response to a complaint filed with the ministry on friday accusing trump executives of illegal “encroachment” on the property  the ministry’s statement said. the owners association has been trying for months to dump president trump’s company  which manages the property  the trump international hotel and tower  blaming the trump company and brand for declining revenues. the trump organization’s involvement in the hotel began well before the property officially opened in 2011. but orestes fintiklis  a miami-based investor whose firm bought a majority of the hotel’s units last year  has led the charge to drive it out. the owners association voted last year to end its relationship with the trump company  and the sides entered into arbitration in october. advertisement the fight intensified last thursday  when mr. fintiklis  managing partner of ithaca capital partners  appeared at the property to hand-deliver termination notices to four managers  the associated press reported. advertisement the trump organization staff called the police and barred the owners’ group from entering a room containing the building’s computer servers and closed-circuit television system  the a.p. said. in response  the news agency reported  the owners’ group shut off power to the room  which also cut phone lines and internet connections throughout the building. a legal complaint filed by mr. fintiklis accused the trump team of improperly destroying documents during the standoff.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. in a statement on monday  trump hotels  a division of the trump organization  accused mr. fintiklis of using strong-arm tactics by deploying “a rogue private security team” to take over the hotel. mr. fintiklis and another owner  the statement said  employed “thug-like  mob-style tactics  repeatedly attempting to force their way into trump hotels’ offices  infiltrate and disrupt its computer systems and threatening and intimidating any employee of the hotel that resisted.” trump hotels also said that mr. fintiklis  by seeking to drive out the trump organization  had violated the terms of his purchase last year. before closing on that deal  which involved 202 of the hotel’s 369 units  mr. fintiklis signed an agreement saying “he would not in any way attempt to interfere with trump’s management of the hotel or take any other steps to terminate its management agreement ” the statement said. the trump company also seemed to taunt mr. fintiklis  suggesting that he had given up on arbitration because he was annoyed or running out of money. “sadly  it now appears as though mr. fintiklis has either lost patience with the pace of the proceedings which he commenced or simply lacks the financial backing he once claimed he had ” the statement said. messages left for mr. fintiklis at ithaca capital partners were not returned. since president trump took office  his name has been removed from hotels in toronto and in the soho neighborhood of new york  though both changes came through negotiated buyouts and the trump organization did not resist. the trump name was also wiped from a set of residential towers on the west side of manhattan after hundreds of tenants signed a petition demanding its removal. in explaining their decision  the owners said they sought “to assume a neutral building identity that appeals to all current and future residents.” ben protess contributed reporting from new york. a version of this article appears in print on february 27  2018  on page a7 of the new york edition with the headline: testy fight overwhelms trump hotel in panama.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement by kenneth p. vogel and rachel shoreyjan. 24  2018  washington — a pair of groups supporting president trump say they raised $30 million last year  then spent tens of thousands of those dollars at the trump international hotel here and on payments to a few trump loyalists like the former campaign manager corey lewandowski and the former milwaukee county sheriff david a. clarke jr.  according to new campaign finance reports and news reports. of the millions raised  at least $1 million came from a coal company that has gained extraordinary access to the trump administration to push for pro-coal policy changes. the campaign finance reports shed light on a network of groups that were formed to support mr. trump  but have spent less than other groups bolstering his agenda  while steering money to the president’s businesses and his most ardent surrogates. one of the groups — a “super pac” called america first action — spent nearly $33 000 at the trump international hotel  primarily on events for donors  and paid tens of thousands of dollars each to mr. lewandowski; brad parscale  a digital strategist for mr. trump’s campaign; and katrina pierson  a campaign spokeswoman. those figures were revealed in a report filed on wednesday with the federal election commission  which shows that the group raised $4 million last year. advertisement an affiliated nonprofit group  america first policies  raised $26 million last year  according to a report by axios. that group is registered under a section of the tax code — 501(c)(4) — that allows it to shield most information about its finances  including the identity of its donors. advertisement the america first groups have been viewed as something of an enigma in campaign finance circles. while many of the republican party’s traditional elite donors have publicly kept their distance from the groups  the organizations have the blessing of the administration and have projected confidence in their fund-raising. but republican operatives have grumbled that the amount the groups say they have raised have dwarfed the amount they have spent to support mr. trump’s political and policy goals during his first year in office. reports filed with the election commission show that the groups combined to spend about $3.2 million — just over 10 percent of what they raised — supporting republican candidates in special elections  including former senator luther strange and roy s. moore  who lost their bids for an alabama senate seat  and karen handel  who won her house campaign in georgia. figures provided by a republican ad buyer indicate that the groups spent an additional $2.8 million on television ads promoting efforts championed by mr. trump to overhaul the tax code and repeal the affordable care act  though there were no records of television ad spending by the groups since the passage last month of the tax overhaul. other republican groups have been advertising heavily this year to bolster public approval of the tax overhaul  which is considered critical to the party’s  midterm election prospects this year. brian o. walsh  the president of america first policies  said the group had paid for online ads “highlighting president trump’s leadership on key issues.” those ads can be harder to track  and mr. walsh declined to provide an “item-by-item breakdown at this time.” a person close to the groups told axios that they had $14 million in the bank headed into this year  which could provide the basis for a major midterm election campaign. but very few of the party’s elite donors were listed among the contributors to america first action in the report filed on wednesday with the election commission.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

who donated $2 million of the $3.7 million raised in the second half of the year by america first action. mr. palmer donated generously in 2016  giving $3 million to a different super pac that supported mr. trump  and an additional $310 000 to a committee associated with mr. trump’s campaign. advertisement an additional $1 million came from murray energy  a coal company based in ohio that has assiduously courted mr. trump as it pressed the new administration to repeal president barack obama’s climate change policies intended to shut down old coal-burning power plants. the company had previously donated a combined $550 000 to help fund the republican convention in cleveland and mr. trump’s inauguration. in the weeks after mr. trump’s inauguration  murray’s chief executive officer  robert e. murray  wrote confidential memos to vice president mike pence and the energy secretary  rick perry  laying out a wish list of environmental rollbacks  which he discussed in a meeting with mr. perry. the administration is on track to fulfill many of the items on mr. murray’s list. murray energy’s donation to america first action came about five months after mr. murray’s meeting with mr. perry. asked whether there was any connection between the donation and the administration’s receptiveness to mr. murray  gary m. broadbent  a spokesman for murray energy  said that “president trump and his administration have always supported the united states coal industry.” america first action has spent heavily to try to court other major donors  as well  paying consultants with significant fund-raising experience  including cara mason  the former finance director of the republican national committee  and marty obst  a longtime aide and current policy adviser to mr. pence. their respective firms were paid $60 000 each in the second half of last year by america first action. the super pac hosted a christmas party for donors at the trump international hotel  which has emerged as a go-to destination for donors and others seeking to rub elbows with trump family members and insiders. the party was attended by mr. pence  as well as trump family members and several members of congress. in addition  america first action spent more than $57 000 on gifts for donors at upscale jewelry stores  the white house historical association and 800-ceo-read  a company that sells bulk orders of books about business  including many of mr. trump’s titles. the super pac also paid $55 000 to a firm owned by mr. lewandowski  $40 000 to one owned by ms. pierson and $137 000 to one owned by mr. parscale. he is in charge of digital outreach for america first action and mr. trump’s campaign  and it is possible that his firm is using the money it received from the pac to buy digital advertising. mr. clarke  who is a spokesman and senior adviser to america first  was paid $32 000 through his firm. a version of this article appears in print on january 25  2018  on page a17 of the

politics,advertisement supported by opinion by jeff roe houston — i’m here to tell my fellow republicans  in particular republican members of congress and the republican consulting class: you can run  but you can’t hide. president trump may not be on the ballot in november  but the election will be a referendum on him  as 2010 was on president barack obama and 2006 was on president george w. bush. we will lose seats. the only question is this: will these losses be catastrophic or manageable? that will be determined by a very specific choice: will the party retreat from its leader or fix bayonets and storm to the front with him? no one fought mr. trump harder and longer than i did  as the campaign manager for ted cruz’s 2016 campaign for the republican nomination. i know the maddening brilliance of mr. trump. i also know history doesn’t favor the president’s party in midterm elections. with the election of a democrat in the 18th congressional district of pennsylvania — a district mr. trump carried by 20 percentage points  but which also has tens of thousands more registered democrats than republicans — it has become media gospel that the president is toxic and that republican candidates will have to distance themselves from him. that narrative is wrong. for starters  i am not persuaded that the national democrats will allow many more personally anti-abortion  pro-gun  anti-pelosi democrats in battleground seats to win nomination. among democratic candidates  conor lamb  the victor in pennsylvania  is the exception  not the rule. while some republican candidates  in swing seats  may benefit from creating distance from mr. trump  a strategic retreat will work only in rare instances. the myth that midterms are decided by swing voters ignores the prevailing reality that large midterm electoral shifts are driven by shifts in base motivation. if you are a republican on the ballot  you are in the same boat as mr. trump  whether you like it or not. if enough people jump ship  generic party identification will suffer  and everyone will sink. in other words  if enough republicans run from their leader  the republican brand will be so diminished as to produce historic defeats up and down the ballot. this happened to the democrats in 2010. to their credit  the democratic consultants and members of congress never formed a professional class of never obama democrats. they stayed in the boat. but when it came to defending obamacare  they stopped rowing. the lesson for republicans: stay in the boat and keep rowing. no  you don’t have to support the president’s tweet storms. but you do have to defend his policy accomplishments. if the election is only a personality contest — rather than about the president’s policies — a historic defeat awaits. it is undoubtedly difficult to differentiate trump policies from the trump persona  because the trump persona dominates news coverage. but republican candidates for congress have to try. tactically  that means being laser-focused on generating local news coverage of policy accomplishments  even when the national cable news fixates on the latest trump outrage. and guess what? despite breathless coverage of the daily outrage generator in the white house  the economy is improving. the tax cuts will  and in fact already are  spurring growth  freeing capital for investment  creating jobs and returning overseas profits to our shores. there is a message to sell. so sell it. i would go further and argue that it is the trump persona so vilified in the media that has in fact made bolder  more sweeping reforms possible than would have been conceivable under almost any other republican who might have been elected. would a president jeb bush have signed a strong executive order on religious liberty  or would a president marco rubio have started construction of a wall? would president john kasich have had the intestinal fortitude to execute such a huge reorganization of the environmental protection agency  dismantling the liberal bureaucracy that with its deeply embedded biases harms our economy? would president mitt romney have pushed through such a major tax overhaul? no way. what makes mr. trump different is that he just doesn’t care what the bed-wetting caucus says about his policies. instead of wringing our hands about his tweets  let’s start playing up his triumphs. that is the best way to minimize midterm damage. democrats lost over 1 000 seats nationwide under mr. obama. while effective in engineering his own political fate  he gutted the hopes of democrats for a decade. republicans have to learn to do what democrats failed to do: run campaigns as the governing party. half the consulting class on our side has spent half of their careers  if not more  running opposition campaigns. they have had the tailwind of resentment and grievance fueling popular anger. now they have to flip the script. they have to learn to highlight accomplishments like tax reform  job creation and regulatory relief. the republican party will either rally around its republican president — and defend our shared accomplishments — or it will enter the fall with a depressed base and a turnout disadvantage that will lead to major losses in congress  governorships and state legislatures. manageable losses or catastrophic defeat: what will it be  my fellow republicans? my answer: fix bayonets and charge the hill. jeff roe (@jeffroe) is the founder of axiom strategies  a republican consulting firm. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the  opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options

politics,advertisement  on washington  by                       carl hulse   march 15  2018  washington — if republicans and president trump are going down to defeat in november’s midterms  they are evidently going down together. faced with a mortifying special election loss in what had been a trump-loving pennsylvania house district  republicans on capitol hill did not point fingers in the president’s direction. instead  they blamed their candidate  rick saccone  for running a lackluster effort while crediting the president with putting mr. saccone within reach of victory by firing up trump supporters at a rally last weekend. “the president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now ” speaker paul d. ryan said wednesday as he and his fellow republicans sought to put the best possible gloss on the latest and most definitive portent yet that their party — not to mention his own speakership — is in severe peril in a very challenging midterm election climate. statements like those and other recent developments highlight just how reluctant republicans are to put any daylight between themselves and mr. trump despite obvious political danger ahead.                  see full results and maps of the pennsylvania special election.             history has shown that a president’s popularity is a key factor in determining the extent of a governing party’s losses in midterm elections. presidents almost always lose congressional seats in midterm contests  but those polling below 50 percent get hit particularly hard. with mr. trump’s approval rating now hovering around 40 percent  house republicans face potential losses deep enough to cost them control of the house  handing democrats formidable power to challenge the president in the final two years of his term. advertisement but congressional republicans are also well aware that  among the conservative republican base  mr. trump is more popular than they are. that reality is reflected by the fact that congressional republicans and the white house have aligned themselves more closely on such high-profile issues as gun control and the investigation into russia’s interference in the 2016 election. congressional republicans have also continued to shy away from talk of the president’s personal conduct and management of the white house. advertisement and despite a wide split between republicans on capitol hill and mr. trump on his proposed new steel and aluminum tariffs  party leaders express little enthusiasm for directly taking on mr. trump even though they worry the new tariffs could roil the economy and undermine what they see as their best argument for re-election: tax cuts. “i think it’s highly unlikely we’d be dealing with that in a legislative way ” senator mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky and the majority leader  told reporters on tuesday  dismissing calls by some republicans to block the tariffs via congressional action.                  a full list of elections for the house and senate  including which races matter most for congressional control.             republican members of the house intelligence committee abruptly ended its investigation into russian collusion this week  concluding that they could find no basis to believe the president or his allies did anything wrong. they also broke with an intelligence community consensus that the russians meant to help mr. trump. their finding came despite the fact that a special counsel continues a wide-ranging investigation that could produce different results. but it

enough. the decision drew a strong rebuke from democrats  including senator chuck schumer of new york  the democratic leader. “sadly  far too many of our friends on the other side of the aisle have been more concerned with protecting the president politically than defending our democracy ” said mr. schumer  who also noted the white house has refused to impose new sanctions on russia that were ordered by congress but has drawn no republican criticism for its inaction. “from the top on down through the rank and file ” mr. schumer said  “the republican party that used to roar like a lion

politics,drillers seek to gain from an easing of obama-era safety and environmental regulations that were adopted after the deepwater horizon disaster killed 11 people. by eric liptonmarch 10  2018  port fourchon  la. — a dozen miles off the coast  on a rusty  aging platform  workers in hard hats and overalls spend their days extracting oil and gas from the ocean floor before retreating at night into tiny weather-beaten steel cubes that act as dorms. the platform  owned by a houston-based energy company that until recently was bankrupt  has none of the grandeur — or profits — of the deep-sea structures over 100 miles offshore that are operated by international giants like exxon mobil and chevron. march 10  2018  but the company  energy xxi  and other struggling operators in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico are beneficiaries of the trump administration’s efforts to increase offshore production here — in large part by upending financial  environmental and safety regulations that the companies oppose. while attention has been focused on president trump’s disputed decision in january to reverse drilling restrictions in nearly all united states coastal waters  the administration has also pursued a rollback of obama-era regulations in the gulf. those rules include safety measures put in place after the explosion and sinking of the deepwater horizon rig in 2010  a disaster that killed 11 people and resulted in the largest marine oil spill in united states’ drilling history. advertisement smaller oil and gas companies  many backed by wall street and private equity firms  say they need the relief to survive financially  and the top safety official at the interior department appointed by mr. trump has appeared an enthusiastic ally. advertisement “help is on the way  help is on the way ” the official  scott angelle  said in september at a gathering in lafayette  la.  of oil and gas executives from so-called independent companies  which focus on drilling alone rather than the extended drilling-to-gas-station operations of bigger competitors. but an analysis of federal inspection data by the new york times found that several of the independent companies seeking the rollback  including energy xxi  had been cited for workplace safety violations in recent years at a rate much higher than the industry average. their offshore platforms suffer in some cases from years of poor maintenance  as well as equipment failures or metal fatigue on aging devices  records show. in addition  there was a string of serious environmental and safety episodes in the last six months involving independent operators  including the death in february of a worker who was removing firefighting equipment from a platform about 30 miles offshore  and an oil spill in october that is considered the largest since the deepwater horizon event  according to interior department records. “these regulations were written with human blood ” said lillian espinoza-gala  a former offshore worker who now serves as an industry safety consultant and opposes easing protections. “the only way we can honor those who lost their lives is for us to learn how to do this in the correct way.” but mr. angelle has close personal and recent ties to the oil and gas industry  particularly the smaller companies seeking his intervention. earlier  as a state official  he worked with them to end a temporary moratorium on new offshore drilling imposed by the obama administration after the deepwater horizon accident.              from texas to alabama  the gulf of mexico is host to 27 000 miles of federally regulated pipelines  and about 2 000 oil and gas platforms.         miss. ala. fla. gulfport la. platform port arthur houston new orleans pipeline galveston tex. port

under president obama to toughen safety standards and enforcement in offshore drilling because of problems exposed by deepwater horizon. mr. angelle spent his first months on the job  records show  traveling between washington  texas and his native louisiana to meet with executives at most of the top offshore oil companies  including some repeatedly cited for safety violations. during the gatherings  most of which were behind closed doors  he asked for suggestions about how federal safety and environmental rules should be rewritten. sometimes he offered up his cellphone number  urging attendees to call rather than send emails or text messages  which could be subject to public records requests. advertisement “not all the good ideas in america come over the banks of the potomac river ” mr. angelle said at a meeting in houston in september that was sponsored by an affiliate of the american petroleum institute  the large industry lobbying group  and attended by a reporter. “to the degree this industry wants to be part of the discussion  tell me where you want me to be and we will be there ” he said  evoking applause. mr. angelle’s leveraging of his role as a safety official to help channel the industry’s financial concerns and loosen regulations represents a sharp departure from his predecessors at the agency  which include a former coast guard vice admiral and a former federal prosecutor. “what appears to be going on is a redefinition of the agency’s mission ” said michael r. bromwich  a former federal prosecutor and inspector general at the justice department who became the first head of the bureau  in may 2010. “this is a safety and environmental protection agency. it is not part of the agency’s mission or mandate to increase production of oil or gas. that is inappropriate.” mr. angelle declined to be interviewed for this article. but in a written statement  he disputed that his agency had backed off its commitment to safety. “we must never have another deepwater horizon or anything close to it ” mr. angelle said. an agency spokeswoman said that all americans benefited from his efforts. “the work we are doing in bsee benefits the entire nation  and we are supporting the president’s objective of safely achieving energy dominance in order to contribute to national security  economic security and energy security ” said eileen angelico  the spokeswoman  adding  “the fact that director angelle deeply understands the industry we regulate is a good thing.” the agency is starting an enforcement effort that will focus inspectors on platforms with the most frequent problems  reducing paperwork requirements so they can spend more time on checking equipment. but mr. angelle’s speeches often center on helping the oil and gas industry cut costs and grow their businesses. and agency documents suggest moves he has already made could save the industry more than $1.3 billion in compliance costs over the next decade. the interior department has joined the effort more broadly. last year  the department suspended a requirement imposed on gulf rig owners  a change that will save them hundreds of millions of dollars. the rule required owners to buy additional bonds or provide other assurance that they could cover the costs of removing rigs once they stopped producing. the rule was meant to keep taxpayers from having to pick up the tab  but a collection of operators last year — with help from high-profile lobbyists like former senator trent lott of mississippi — convinced the trump administration that the requirement was too onerous. the change has mostly benefited independents like energy xxi. advertisement separately  the administration has reduced the royalties independent companies pay when drilling on new leases on the continental shelf  the shallow area of the gulf before the ocean floor drops more than a mile deep. and it has eased up on deadlines for the removal of unproductive or damaged platforms  a change that also primarily benefits the independents  as they own wells on the shelf that in many cases are decades old and will soon need to be repaired or demolished. the rollbacks have been popular across louisiana  which is home to dozens of companies that serve offshore operations and is where mr. angelle grew up. “too much damn regulation in the world ” said john girard  72  a neighbor of mr. angelle’s from breaux bridge. in a presentation to wall street analysts  houston-based renaissance offshore  one of the gulf’s independent operators  called its business plan “a targeted acquire and exploit strategy.” while major oil companies had given up on shallow-water drilling in favor of bigger prizes farther offshore  renaissance was “happy to assume control of forgotten assets with bypassed reserves on the continental shelf ” the presentation said. when oil was selling for $100 a barrel  it was relatively easy for independent companies to find private equity firms willing to invest in buying the aging platforms and deploying new technologies — such as horizontal drilling — to tap reserves that exxon mobil and others had left behind. advertisement the “used cars” of the offshore oil patch were becoming profitable fleets again for companies like renaissance  energy xxi and fieldwood energy  which often bought up hundreds of platforms at a time as the major companies moved to deeper  more lucrative waters. even as the price of oil dropped precipitously in recent years  the purchases continued  including a move last july by cantium  a louisiana start-up  to buy 300 active wells  along with 152 platforms and other offshore structures  from chevron  one of the last major oil companies to leave shallow waters. “we see tremendous potential ” said mark ian smithard  cantium’s chief operating officer. “we see changes taking place in the regulatory environment  and we are working with our industry partners to make sure they go through.” but federal safety inspection records hint at the difficulties many of the independents have faced  and help explain why regulatory changes by the trump administration are seen as so crucial to the shallow-water industry’s survival. approximately 240 platforms in the shallow waters of the gulf  serving over 2 000 oil and gas wells as of last year  are listed by the interior department as “idle iron.” this means that they are severely damaged  not operating and no longer economically viable  and that they pose environmental and safety hazards. most of the platforms are controlled by independent companies like energy xxi and are decades old. even as safety has improved for the industry as a whole  some independent operators have lagged significantly behind  the records show. renaissance  which produced 1.5 million barrels last year  as well as 3.8 billion cubic feet of gas  received 47 safety warnings or citations in 48 inspections in 2017. among these were 20 orders to immediately shut down malfunctioning or unsafe equipment on offshore platforms. overall  renaissance had a violation ratio that was nearly twice the average  according to a times analysis of agency data obtained through a public records request. there were two accidents on renaissance platforms during that period  including a fire that erupted 48 miles offshore. two workers jumped into the gulf after concluding that the firefighting equipment on board was essentially useless  like “putting water on a hot grease fire ” the records show. crew members were rescued by a passing boat after they got into life rafts. advertisement in the past 18 months  the company was also issued a violation notice by the environmental protection agency for not complying with a permit that allowed it to dump wastewater  and by the transportation department for failing to have qualified staff inspect its 32 miles of underwater pipeline  federal records show. energy xxi  which emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy at the end of 2016  was found to have 207 safety violations during 337 inspections. conditions were so serious that inspectors moved nine times to shut down entire oil platforms  not simply broken components they found. last year  the company paid more than $1.1 million in fines  for four different episodes. in one case  it abandoned two offshore wells without ensuring that they had been properly plugged  allowing natural gas to bubble up from the ocean floor. in 2017  the interior department conducted four separate investigations into accidents on energy xxi platforms (out of 46 conducted across the entire gulf). one of the inquiries looked at a fire that broke out in october just six miles off the coast  in 49 feet of water  when a gas compressor built in 1979 ruptured and melted. the most serious offenses involved black elk energy offshore operations  which was convicted in august of eight felony violations related to a platform explosion that killed three workers and injured several others. it has since gone out of business  one of at least 19 oil and gas companies that have operated in the gulf to go bankrupt since 2015. representatives from energy xxi declined repeated requests for comment. a spokesman for renaissance said the company had already moved to improve its compliance record this year. “as a company we not only adhere to industry best practices but look to exceed on them in every way ” renaissance said in a written statement. ridgelake energy  a small company operating in shallow waters  also had a large number of reported violations last year. its owner  william m. hines  blamed the run-down condition of equipment he acquired from one of the gulf’s many bankrupt operators. “there is a lot of broken stuff out there ” he said. “we are working to get all this back into shape.” advertisement concern among enforcement officers has been growing because some of the independent companies are looking to extend operations toward the gulf’s deep waters  where the risks are even greater. on the same day in february that it filed for bankruptcy  fieldwood announced that it was going to acquire $700 million in oil wells from noble energy  which is leaving the offshore area to focus on shale drilling on land. with that purchase  fieldwood hopes to start major explorations in deep water  even as it faces scrutiny for violations on the shelf. a spokesman for fieldwood said the company was already operating in deep water and would be “be much stronger financially when we come out of this restructuring.” lars herbst  the gulf director for the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement  warned offshore operators at a briefing last year that certain kinds of shutdown had doubled. he attributed the spike in such orders  which involve an “unsafe situation” that “poses an immediate danger to the entire facility or personnel ” to a large number of “financially at-risk companies.” those businesses  he said  operated 449 of the 2 104 active facilities in the gulf. more recently  the agency conducted a two-day inspection blitz involving gas leaks on offshore platforms  many of them owned by independent operators in shallow waters. inspectors found that 17 percent of the 36 platforms and well operations they visited had “oil and gas accumulations ” industry lingo for leaks that can lead to fires  agency records show. eight facilities either lacked operating gas detectors or had other problems with their leak-detection systems. “it was quite concerning ” said jason mathews  the agency’s chief for safety management in the gulf. the cajundome in lafayette is well known as a venue for college basketball games  country music concerts and monster truck shows. but for mr. angelle  56  it is associated with an enduring alliance he forged with the offshore oil and gas industry nearly eight years ago. in july 2010  just three months after the deepwater horizon accident  mr. angelle  then lieutenant governor  stood in the arena before more than 10 000 locals  offshore workers and industry executives. he promised to pressure the obama administration to end the moratorium on new offshore drilling  which had deeply angered communities that depended on it. the ban was lifted that october. advertisement “enough is enough ” he said with a thick cajun accent in a rousing speech laced with rhymes and applause lines. “and it’s time to quit punishing innocent american workers to achieve some unrealistic political agenda.” one of nine children whose father owned a local ford dealership before going into louisiana politics himself  mr. angelle turned the arena on fire by ticking off the names of local families.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please

is hurting the cheramies  and the calaises  and the dupuises  and the robins  and the boudreauxs and the thibodeauxs!” mr. angelle knew his audience well: after graduating from the university of louisiana at lafayette  he started his career by scouting for onshore drilling sites. he eventually went on to lead the state agency charged with regulating the oil and gas industry  and made a series of appeals to interior department officials — some at the safety agency he now runs — to press the federal government to soften its response to the deepwater horizon accident. his ties to the industry are also financial. mr. angelle was paid $1 million to serve for four years on the board of directors at sunoco logistics  a pipeline company. and when he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2015  he benefited from large contributions from the industry. one of these was a $1.25 million donation to louisiana rising  a political action committee that backed him  from a top executive at an oil and gas company that then had hundreds of gulf platforms. mr. angelle promised voters that he was “fighting for louisiana’s energy industry” in one advertisement. after being appointed to his current post  mr. angelle made a return visit to the cajundome last september as part of his outreach to oil and gas executives. mr. angelle  agency officials note  has sold off any industry stock assets to comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules. his job was new  but his message was familiar: how can i help your companies thrive? in addition to safety enforcement  he made it clear that he viewed his role as helping the industry grow. “one of the things that we want to do is help unlock the next wave of investment into the gulf of mexico ” he said at the time. “that is what we want to do.” the next day  at a meeting with executives in houston  mr. angelle acknowledged that efforts to assist the industry could be hampered if safety problems persisted. advertisement “at the end  we are only as strong as the weakest link ” he said. “and if we have someone who is a bad actor  you owe it to yourselves  you owe it to your families  you owe it to the industry  you owe it to america  to call them out.” even before this gathering  the trump administration had signed off on the first rollback of industry regulations  including the one pertaining to the removal of unproductive offshore platforms. the lobbying effort on that rule was funded in part by companies  like renaissance and energy xxi  that were plagued by safety violations. it involved both mr. lott and his partner  john breaux  a democrat and former senator from louisiana   according to a disclosure report. the rule had taken effect late in the obama administration after government auditors estimated that it would cost nearly $40 billion to remove the old wells  but determined that oil companies had issued just $2.9 billion worth of bonds to cover the expense. the obama administration’s remedy was to require companies to buy more bonds  or provide other financial guarantees  to prove they had the capacity to pay for the removal of the wells. the industry’s reaction was swift. “the louisiana economy needs a kick start  not a kick in the teeth ” gifford briggs  the top lobbyist and vice president at the louisiana oil and gas association  wrote in 2016. the problems associated with the old platforms can be severe  as seen in an oil leak 12 miles off the louisiana coast that has been spreading a sheen across the gulf for more than a decade. the leak  from a collapsed platform once operated by the now defunct taylor energy company  could continue for 100 years unless it is properly sealed  the safety agency has estimated. next  the oil and gas companies pushed to unravel a major safety requirement known as the well-control rule  which regulates methods used to drill new oil and gas wells — and prevent explosions. it took six years after the deepwater horizon accident to enact the rule  a process that involved thousands of hours of consultations with industry experts and public safety officials  according to mr. bromwich  the former federal prosecutor who helped start the process. advertisement the new rule  which took effect in july 2016  required additional inspections of devices called blowout preventers  the equipment that failed during the deepwater horizon disaster. to prevent accidents  another provision required oil and gas platforms to shut down temporarily when so-called lift boats positioned themselves for repair work. at a meeting mr. angelle called in september  industry officials detailed their objections while members of staff — some of whom helped write the rule — sat taking notes. separately  mr. angelle held private meetings with representatives from the same companies  according to a copy of his calender  obtained through a public records request. “it is mostly knee-jerk reactions that came out of washington ” craig castille of stone energy said in prepared remarks that called for more than a dozen changes to the regulation. “the pendulum has swung way too far to the right.” two days later  mr. angelle directed his top aides to prepare documents explaining how the agency had justified the requirement  according to emails obtained through the public records request. “please highlight the sections around the drilling margin and any discussion on blowout preventer ” mr. angelle wrote. “this will help inform me.” in late december  mr. angelle sent the white house a proposal to overhaul the well-control rule  estimating that oil companies would save $986 million in the coming decade. the proposal included many changes requested by the industry  such as loosening inspection requirements for blowout preventers and eliminating the need to shut down operations as lift boats approached. “oil and natural gas operators raised concerns about certain regulatory provisions that impose undue burdens on their industry  but do not significantly enhance worker safety or environmental protection ” said the confidential draft  a copy of which was obtained by the times. though the proposal is undergoing a review before the revisions are made public  the white house has made clear that it welcomes the effort. a white house spokeswoman declined to comment. advertisement also in december  the safety bureau moved to ease requirements on the maintenance of offshore oil and gas platforms  cutting costs by an additional $228 million over the next decade. to some longtime residents and activists  the changes  and the hundreds of millions of dollars they will save for companies  are not worth the possible trade-offs in safety and environmental protections. “it’s always the workers who pay ” said scott eustis of the gulf restoration network  an environmental group. “and gulf coast workers will pay with their bodies  their lives  their children  who will grow up without fathers.” mr. bromwich  like other former officials who spent years drafting the safety rules  lamented the move to weaken them. “it’s just a terrible signal to the industry as to who is in charge ” mr. bromwich said. “it is classic swamp behavior.” but for offshore crews  the changes bring excitement and renewed optimism about work. “it affects from the lowest guy to the highest guy  regulations  all day long ” said don leboeuf  an energy xxi crew worker here in port fourchon  before he boarded a boat to a platform 60 miles offshore. huge drillships — with names like deepwater asgard  owned by transocean  the same company that owned deepwater horizon — have been anchored in place 18 miles offshore for months at a time with their generators running and their crews on board  waiting for work. when a small boat with a reporter and photographer recently pulled up alongside deepwater asgard  workers peered over the side  wondering why they had visitors. asked what they thought about the trump administration’s rollback of regulations in the gulf  one of them yelled  “drill  baby  drill!” advertisement several weeks later  the ship actually did get a drilling contract  and is now back at work. even in a difficult period  the gulf generates 97 percent of offshore oil in the united states  about 18 percent of the country’s crude oil and $2.8 billion a year in royalty and lease payments to the federal government. and 2017 was a record year for the gulf  with a total of 1.65 million barrels a day. there are 2 200 offshore oil and gas platforms along an 820-mile stretch of coast between brownsville  tex.  and mobile  ala.  and they are an imposing presence  resembling in places a battalion of imperial walkers from the “star wars” movies. but in early march  the number of drilling rigs used in the gulf was just 14  compared with 145 at the industry’s peak in 2000. the downturn was set off by a drop in oil prices  competition from fracking and other sources and  local businesses will tell you  an overbearing regulatory reaction to the deepwater horizon accident. talk of lifting regulations echoes throughout the coastal communities that serve offshore operations  particularly the smaller concerns that specialize in shallow-water drilling. “there is just not a lot of business out there right now for the offshore service companies ” said court b. ramsay  president of aries marine of lafayette  which has a fleet of 26 boats used in repairing oil and gas platforms in shallow waters. “it would be a shot in the arm for sure  for my business and many business like mine  if we can get some relief from some of these rules.” statistics from the greater lafourche port commission  which operates the port here about 160 miles from lafayette  show that as many as 450 boats passed in and out of the piers each day  mostly to serve the oil and gas industry  during drilling’s peak. now there are about 300. in addition  diesel fuel sales have dropped from about 40 million gallons a month to about 20 million  said chett chiasson  the port’s executive director. the fall in oil prices certainly contributed to the decline  mr. chiasson said  but he also blames the obama administration. “there were regulations that were not necessarily increasing safety  but they were just increasing the cost of the activities in the oil and gas industry and thus hindering their ability to keep operating in the gulf ” he said. “we know things need to be safe and operate in a safe manner. but we don’t need to overregulate in a way that disincentivizes investment.” advertisement port fourchon itself has the feel of a moon base. it is reached via an eight-mile bridge intended to keep the port operating even during flooding  an increasingly common occurrence because of damage to protective wetlands caused by drilling and dredging. every major oil and gas company has an encampment with ships and repair warehouses. hundreds of workers converge daily in a rush-hour scramble of muddy pickup trucks. the port operates around the clock  365 days a year  with hundreds of service boats and helicopters ferrying crews to and from offshore platforms and drilling rigs. giant workboats — the equivalent of floating dump trucks — carry loads of mud  fuel  water  food and other supplies the crews require. safety remains a focus. there are signs on the drillships and offshore platforms reminding crews of the importance of following safety rules. at the port entrance  a memorial depicts a mermaid ascending from the water  complete with a cloak that includes an oil rig. the our lady of the gulf statue was installed last year to honor offshore workers who have died in the gulf  including the those killed in the deepwater horizon explosion. but the primary concern voiced here is economic. “half the supply boats and crew boats up and down the bayou have been seized by the banks ” said kathleen chiasson  who once ran a truck-dispatching company that supplied the industry  and now works behind the counter of a gas-station mini market. “i just hope someone can do it to get it back to at least half the way it used to be.” agustin armendariz contributed reporting from new york  and clifford krauss from houston. a version of this article appears in print on march 11  2018  on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline: targeting rules ‘written with human blood’.

politics,advertisement supported by by charles m. blow as richard haass  president of the council on foreign relations  tweeted friday: “@realdonaldtrump is now set for war on 3 fronts: political vs bob mueller  economic vs china/others on trade  and actual vs. iran and/or north korea. this is the most perilous moment in modern american history — and it has been largely brought about by ourselves  not by events.” i agree fully with this assessment. some have viewed president trump’s recent moves as a sign of rising self-assuredness in the man. i see quite the opposite. i see a man growing increasingly irascible as his sense of desperation surges. the world is closing in on trump and he is in an existential fight for his own survival. this is precisely what makes him so dangerous: as the personal threat to him grows  his threat to the country grows. the power of the american presidency is an awesome power  and trump will harness and deploy it all as guard and guarantee against his own demise. add to his sense of panic his compounding emotional and psychological liabilities: he has an inflated view of his own skills  talents and expertise. he knows only a fraction of what he has convinced himself that he knows. he prefers casual conversation to literary examination  opting to listen rather than to read  which is both a sign of a severely compromised and restrained intellect and an astounding arrogance about one’s information absorption. while pundits mull whether the cloud of chaos trump keeps swirling around him is simple incompetence or strategic plotting  the new york times reported friday: “aides said there was no grand strategy to the president’s actions  and that he got up each morning this week not knowing what he would do. much as he did as a new york businessman at trump tower  mr. trump watched television  reacted to what he saw on television and then reacted to the reaction.” this is all gut and instinct. this is all reactionary emoting by a man of poor character  one addicted to affirmation. he desperately needs to be the king-of-every-hill he sees in the mirror: he was the ladies’ man  businessman  smartest man  toughest man. there was nothing beyond him  and he didn’t have to follow the rules  he only had to follow his instincts. but washington politics is a long way from new york city real estate. wrangling senate votes is a long way from prowling for playmates. this is the big leagues and this little man is feeling the stress and strain of it. even if he can’t be good  he at least wants to look good  to fake it to try to make it. this may be one of the reasons he is inviting so many television personalities into his cabinet. this is all just window dressing. trump is truly in the cross hairs  and he knows it. just as he is going to war on three fronts  he is being attacked on three fronts. the robert mueller investigation is bearing down on him as an inevitable in-person interview with trump — and all of its potential pitfalls — draws nearer. i have resisted predictions about what could come of the investigation because it would be little more than conjecture. only mueller knows what mueller knows. but  it appears to me that the president is surely acting like a guilty man  or at least someone trying to shield another who is guilty. then there is the porn star  the playmate and the reality star: three women currently in litigation over sexual contact with trump — two admittedly consensual and one allegedly not. the most tantalizing and threatening of the three is the case with porn star stephanie clifford  whose stage name is stormy daniels. daniels and her attorney  as well as language in the nondisclosure agreement that she signed  suggests that she has some compromising written and photographic evidence about her encounters with trump. furthermore  in daniels  trump seems to have met his match as an internet troll. when someone on twitter asked clifford  “what snack foods do you recommend for watching you on “60 minutes” tomorrow night? nachos and wings feel so january  you know?” clifford responded: “tacos and mini corndogs just seems so right … and yet  so wrong. i believe the more traditional choice is popcorn  however.” yes  the subtext of that tweet is exactly what you think it is. note to self: never pick a fight with a porn star. and now with the massive march for our lives  we see that going into the midterms not only are black voters and suburban white women energized against this president and his congressional protectors  so are young people who feel betrayed  particularly on the issue of gun control  by politicians beholden to the n.r.a. trump talked big about standing up to the n.r.a.  and then summarily caved to the n.r.a. if this surge of enthusiasm leads to democrats flipping the house — and the long shot  the senate — and something comes of the mueller investigation or the women’s lawsuits  you can rest assured that impeachment proceedings will be in the offing. this is why trump is going to war. i invite you to join me on facebook and follow me on twitter (@charlesmblow)  or email me at chblow@nytimes.com. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by kirk semple  ben protess and steve edermarch 3  2018  panama — the trump international hotel and tower here is president trump’s only hotel property in latin america. at 70 stories  it is the tallest building in panama  offers sweeping views of panama bay and features five outdoor swimming pools. the rooms come with trump-branded bathrobes  stationery and mouthwash. but in recent days  guests have witnessed a decidedly less glamorous side of the operation: yelling and shoving matches involving security personnel and others  the presence of police officers in kevlar helmets  and various interventions by panamanian labor regulators  forensic specialists and a justice of the peace. the source of the drama? the businessman who recently purchased a majority stake in the hotel wants the trumps out. and the trumps  who have a long-term contract to manage the property  are refusing to go. in a letter marked “private & confidential” to the hotel’s other owners  the businessman  orestes fintiklis  likened the trumps to leeches who had attached to the property  “draining our last drops of blood ” according to a copy reviewed by the new york times. he has also filed legal actions accusing the trump family business  the trump organization  of mismanaging the hotel. advertisement the trump organization  in turn  has accused mr. fintiklis of using “thug-like  mob-style tactics” in trying to force his way into the hotel’s administrative offices  which prompted the physical and verbal altercations  and of engaging in a “fraudulent scheme” to strip the property of its trump management and branding. mr. fintiklis’s criticisms of the company’s management “are a complete sham and a fraud ” the company said in a court filing. advertisement this past week  panama’s public ministry said it was looking into whether there had been any “punishable conduct” in the dispute — which means that an arm of a foreign government finds itself in the extraordinary position of investigating a business owned by the american president. just seven years ago  at the hotel’s grand opening  the president of panama at the time joined mr. trump in extolling the property. panama city was then awash with international investors and a booming economy  earning it the nickname “dubai of latin america.” alan garten  the trump organization’s chief legal officer  said president trump had no role in the current dispute. “this has absolutely nothing to do with the president of the united states ” he said. “it is purely a commercial dispute ” adding that “it is simply getting more attention  obviously.” all indications point to business  not politics  as the source of the tensions  and at any other moment  the trump organization and its army of lawyers might have relished this sort of pitched battle. but the panamanian misadventure has become the family business’s biggest headache at a time when its founder is in the white house and every move and woe is magnified across the planet. the business is also showing other signs of receding: the trump organization last year agreed to buyout deals that removed the trump name from once-prized properties in new york and toronto. with those stresses and strains  the company is reluctant to walk away from the panama property and possibly invite other partners to challenge their agreements  according to people close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity. the trumps also believe that the law is on their side  according to their lawyers  who argue that their management agreement prevents mr. fintiklis from terminating the contract without an arbitrator’s order. the contract to manage the hotel extends through 2031  and the trumps say they want to stand behind their employees  several of whom mr. fintiklis has sought to fire  for the duration of the deal. advertisement the dispute comes as the trumps’ property — like many panamanian hotels — is struggling. the hotel lost over $1 million last year  according to the hotel’s confidential financial documents reviewed by the times  after turning a gross operating profit of more than $800 000 in 2016. (the results are unaudited and may improve somewhat once they are finalized.) mr. fintiklis  39  declined to comment  but he has made several notable — and provocative — appearances at the hotel in recent days. on one evening  following a verbal confrontation with trump employees  he and his entourage of about a dozen people retired to the lobby and had pizza delivered from a restaurant on the property. then mr. fintiklis played music from “zorba the greek” on the lobby’s baby grand piano while his friends sang along. born in cyprus  mr. fintiklis served as an officer in the country’s military before studying law at oxford university. he now lives in south florida and runs his own investment firm  ithaca capital partners. “he’s a very smart individual  and he worked with us for 10 years so he’s very well trained ” said pierre charalambides  a co-founder of dolphin capital partners  a real estate private equity firm where mr. fintiklis previously worked. “this battle with trump  it fits him perfectly.” in 2017  mr. fintiklis agreed to buy 202 of the hotel’s 369 units for about $25 million  making him the controlling owner of the hotel. the 70-story tower also includes a casino and a separate condominium development  which are not part of the dispute between the trumps and mr. fintiklis. the trumps say they blessed the transaction  on the condition that mr. fintiklis not interfere with their management of the hotel. when the purchase was finalized in august  the trump-fintiklis partnership initially seemed promising. mr. fintiklis hailed the hotel as “an iconic property” and said he looked forward to working with the trumps. but soon after closing on the purchase  he tried to remove them. his campaign began in earnest in october. he arranged for the hotel’s unit owners to meet — the trumps say he falsely portrayed the session as a “meet and greet” — and they voted to declare the trumps in default of their management agreement. the dispute soon spilled into the legal system  with mr. fintiklis seeking arbitration to remove the trumps. advertisement the trumps say that the rapid-fire nature of mr. fintiklis’s legal efforts show that he never intended to cooperate  and that he had been planning an attack from the get-go. “we just want to run the hotel peacefully  and without interference ” said mr. garten  the trump organization lawyer. “but i look forward to litigating this  and have no doubt we will prevail.” the president continues to own the company through a trust but has turned over day-to-day management to his eldest sons  donald jr. and eric. more than a decade ago — long before mr. fintiklis came into the picture — the trumps began their foray into panama when they teamed up with the developer roger khafif and his firm  newland international properties  as well as another partner. newland signed an agreement with the trump organization  which would brand and manage the property. in a 2007 bond offering  newland said the trump name would be a boon to the project: “we benefit from the international prestige and name recognition associated with the trump brand name.” the project united the trumps with influential political figures  including ricardo martinelli  the president of panama at the time. “you’re my friend. great honor ” mr. trump said to the president at the grand opening in july 2011.  please verify

fled to the united states in 2015 as panamanian authorities opened an investigation into allegations of corruption and illegal surveillance. he is currently in the federal detention center in miami  fighting extradition. during the 2008 financial crisis  the project encountered financial difficulties during the development phase. newland defaulted on its debt soon after the building opened and later filed for bankruptcy. when mr. fintiklis became majority owner last year  the hotel was struggling  a fact he soon blamed on the trumps. advertisement withering in his criticism  he said in one court filing that “abysmal management” of the hotel  along with “material breaches” of its management contract and fiduciary duties  had “dramatically” driven down profits and the condition of the building. “the hotel has been virtually empty ” the filing said  a claim the trumps dispute. the trump organization declined to reveal the hotel’s occupancy rates  but in a letter to hotel unit owners  the company argued that the hotel “continues to outperform the market by a wide margin ” despite a weakening hotel market in panama. the trumps say that mr. fintiklis was aware of the hotel’s performance  and the broader hotel market woes  when he signed the deal. a hotel building boom over the past decade has tripled the number of hotel rooms in the country  according to armando rodríguez  president of the panamanian hotel association. during the same period  however  occupancy rates have steadily fallen — to about 47 percent last year from about double that rate in 2008  mr. rodríguez said. algerd monstavicius  who bought one of the hotel’s penthouses as an investment in 2007  four years before the building opened  said he had seen revenues from his unit plummet in the past year. he attributes the falloff in part to president trump’s hard-line stance on immigration and antipathy toward him across much of latin america. “the perception is: trump is anti-latino ” said mr. monstavicius  78  a retired pathologist living in incline village  nev. “and that’s reflected in the occupancy.” lawyers and executives from both sides of the dispute said the panamanian government  at least so far  appeared to be showing no favoritism in either direction. at various times during the past week  delegations of government investigators and ministry officials  often accompanied by armed security forces  have spilled from the elevators into the hotel’s elegant sky lobby  as perplexed hotel guests looked on. as if the standoff were not bizarre enough  a number of apparent coincidences embellish the tale even further. for one  dolphin capital partners  where mr. fintiklis worked for 10 years  was founded in 2004 by a pair of investors who once worked at george soros’s real estate investment arm. advertisement there is no evidence that mr. soros  a huge democratic donor and critic of president trump  played any role in the turmoil here  or that partisan american politics are a factor in the effort to remove the trumps. mr. charalambides  the dolphin co-founder  said his firm had no current business connection to mr. soros. in addition  mr. fintiklis’s new york lawyers operate out of 666 fifth avenue in manhattan  the financially troubled office tower owned by the family of jared kushner  president trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. and mr. fintiklis filed the registration papers for his company  ithaca capital partners  in delaware on nov. 9  2016 — the day after president trump won the election. kirk semple reported from panama city

politics,advertisement supported by opinion by david brody last august  president trump sat behind the resolute desk in the oval office and looked me straight in the eyes. with a look of reflection and purposefulness  he discussed his upbringing and fondly recalled a vivid childhood memory from the 1950s: watching billy graham sermons on television with his father. “my father was a fan of billy graham ” the president said. he recalled how his father  fred  attended the historic 1957 new york city crusade. mr. graham  who died last week at 99  brought both evangelism and evangelicalism into the mainstream of american culture. meanwhile  young donald grew to be successful  wealthy and famous — culminating with his becoming the leader of the free world. in the process  he too brought evangelicals somewhere  a place so many would have never imagined: an embrace of donald trump. of all the questions surrounding the current president  perhaps the most perplexing is this: how could evangelicals get behind a man like mr. trump  especially well-known conservative leaders who both treasure and champion morality? constant news reports paint a picture of an out-of-control  angry  mentally unstable  reckless president who is prejudiced against all of humanity except white people with modest incomes and out-of-date values. but after interviewing scores of evangelical leaders  i have developed a different perspective. most of the world  and even most reporters  know only the public side of president trump. in private  evangelical leaders have come to recognize a more compassionate side. for example  mr. trump took a car ride with mike pence along with billy graham’s son franklin and tony perkins  a leading figure on the christian right  during the louisiana floods of 2016. impressed by what franklin graham’s christian ministry had done for flood victims  mr. trump told him that he was writing it a six-figure check  which mr. graham told him to send to mr. perkins’s church. both men were moved by his impulsive kindness  and a bond was formed. another story involves mr. trump and the televangelist james robison praying together inside an s.u.v. on the airport tarmac in panama city  fla.  during a campaign stop. when mr. trump exited the car  he gave mr. robison a hug  pulled him up against his chest firmly and said  “man  i sure love you.” a small gesture  perhaps  but heartfelt  real and so unlike the caricature of the president most of us see. and practically every evangelical leader i interviewed has a similar story. critics say that the trump-evangelical relationship is transactional  that they support him to see their agenda carried out. in fact  evangelicals take the long view on mr. trump; they afford him grace when he doesn’t deserve it. few dispute that mr. trump may need a little more grace than others. but evangelicals truly do believe that all people are flawed  and yet christ offers them grace. shouldn’t they do the same for the president? this is more than a biblical mandate. the bible is replete with examples of flawed individuals being used to accomplish god’s will. evangelicals i interviewed said they believed that mr. trump was in the white house for a reason. bishop wayne jackson  who is the pastor of great faith ministries international in detroit and calls himself a lifelong democrat  remembers mr. trump’s campaign visit to his church. he told me that the moment mr. trump got out of the car  “the spirit of the lord told me that that’s the next president of the united states.” evangelical leaders also see a civic obligation to speak godly counsel to him  on policy and personal matters. he is  after all  the president. and it’s paying off. i’ve watched mr. trump through the lens of the faith community for years  and he has delivered the policy goods and is progressing on the spiritual ones. my reporting suggests donald trump is on a spiritual voyage that has accelerated in recent years  thanks to evangelicals who have employed the biblical mandate of sharing and showing god’s love to him rather than shunning him. president trump told me that he “was exposed to a lot of people  from a religious standpoint  that i would’ve never met before. and so it has had an impact on me.” this president’s effect on our cultural norms has been shocking. his critics would call it appalling; evangelicals say it’s immensely satisfying: they’ve seen a culture deteriorate quickly in the past decade  and they’re looking for a bold culture warrior to fight for them. showing that god does indeed have a sense of humor  he gave them mr. trump. yet in god’s perfection  it’s a match made in heaven. mr. trump and evangelicals share a disdain for political correctness  a world seen through absolutes and a desire to see an america that embraces judeo-christian values again rather than rejecting them. finally  why in the world wouldn’t evangelicals get behind and support a man who not only is in line with most of their agenda but also has delivered time and time again? the victories are numerous: the courts  pro-life policies  the coming embassy in jerusalem and religious liberty issues  just to name a few. he easily wins the unofficial label of “most evangelical-friendly united states president ever.” does mr. trump have moral failings? yes. critics will suggest a hypocrisy coming from evangelical leaders who are quick to denounce the ethical failings of others who don’t have an “r” next to their name. but the goal of evangelicals has always been winning the larger battle over control of the culture  not to get mired in the moral failings of each and every candidate. for evangelicals  voting in the macro is the moral thing to do  even if the candidate is morally flawed. evangelicals have tried the “moral” candidate before. jimmy carter was once the evangelical candidate. how did that work out in the macro? george w. bush was the evangelical candidate in 2000: he pushed traditional conservative policies  but he doesn’t come close to mr. trump’s courageous blunt strokes in defense of evangelicals. evangelicals have found their man. it may seem mystifying to outsiders  but for someone like me  with a front-row seat to an inside view  it makes perfect sense. maybe they’re taking their cue from billy graham  embracing presidents with moral failings rather than rejecting them. david brody  the host of “faith nation” on the christian broadcasting network  is a co-author  with scott lamb  of “the faith of donald trump: a spiritual biography.” follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by peter bakermarch 18  2018  washington — president trump on sunday abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election  lashing out at what he characterized as a partisan investigation and alarming republicans who feared he might seek to shut it down. mr. trump has long suggested that allegations that he or his campaign conspired with russia to influence the election were a “hoax” and part of a “witch hunt ” but until this weekend he had largely heeded the advice of lawyers who counseled him not to directly attack robert s. mueller iii  the special counsel  for fear of antagonizing prosecutors. “why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats  some big crooked hillary supporters  and zero republicans?” mr. trump wrote on twitter. “another dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? and yet  there is no collusion!” the attack on mr. mueller  a longtime republican and former f.b.i. director appointed by a republican president  george w. bush  drew immediate rebukes from some members of the party who expressed concern that it might presage an effort to fire the special counsel. such a move  they warned  would give the appearance of a corrupt attempt to short-circuit the investigation and set off a bipartisan backlash. advertisement “if he tried to do that  that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency  because we’re a rule-of-law nation ” senator lindsey graham of south carolina  an ally of the president  said on “state of the union” on cnn. “when it comes to mr. mueller  he is following the evidence where it takes him  and i think it’s very important he be allowed to do his job without interference  and there are many republicans who share my view.” advertisement among them was senator jeff flake of arizona  a sharp critic of mr. trump who appeared on the same program. “people see that as a massive red line that can’t be crossed ” he said. he urged mr. trump’s advisers to prevail on him not to fire mr. mueller. “we have confidence in mueller.” representative trey gowdy  republican of south carolina  said if the president was innocent  he should “act like it” and leave mr. mueller alone  warning of dire repercussions if the president tried to fire the special counsel. “i would just counsel the president — it’s going to be a very  very long  bad 2018  and it’s going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and he was elected do ” mr. gowdy said on “fox news sunday.” “let it play out its course. if you’ve done nothing wrong  you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.” the house speaker  paul d. ryan  republican of wisconsin  issued a statement likewise warning mr. trump to back off. “as the speaker has always said  mr. mueller and his team should be able to do their job ” said ashlee strong  a spokeswoman. his counterpart  senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky  had no comment  as did a number of other top senate republicans. late in the day  the white house tried to douse the furor. “in response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration  the white house yet again confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel  robert mueller ” ty cobb  a white house lawyer  said in a statement. the president’s tweet followed a statement by mr. trump’s personal lawyer  john dowd  on saturday calling on the justice department to end the special counsel investigation. mr. trump followed up that evening with a tweet arguing that “the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.” the two weekend tweets were the first time mr. trump has used mr. mueller’s name on twitter  not counting a message he once retweeted  and reflected what advisers called a growing impatience fueled by anger that the investigation was now looking at his business activities. advertisement the new york times reported last week that mr. mueller has subpoenaed records from the trump organization. mr. trump’s lawyers met with mr. mueller’s team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation  including the scope of his interest in the trump organization. for months  mr. trump had been reassured by his lawyers that the investigation would wrap up soon — by thanksgiving  then christmas  then new year’s. but with the expansion into mr. trump’s business  it seems increasingly clear that mr. mueller is not ready to conclude his inquiry. a top adviser to mr. trump said on sunday that the white house had grown weary of the inquiry. “we have cooperated in every single way  every single paper they’ve asked for  every single interview ” marc short  the president’s legislative director  said on “face the nation” on cbs. “there’s a growing frustration that after a year and millions and millions of dollars spent on this  there remains no evidence of collusion with russia.” a president cannot directly fire a special counsel but can order his attorney general to do so. even then  a cause has to be cited  like conflict of interest. since attorney general jeff sessions  a former campaign adviser  has recused himself from the russia investigation — to mr. trump’s continuing irritation — the task would fall to the deputy attorney general  rod j. rosenstein.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. but mr. rosenstein said as recently as last week that he sees no justification for firing mr. mueller  meaning that he would either have to change his mind or be removed himself. the third-ranking official at the justice department  rachel brand  knowing this issue could reach her  decided last month to step down. the next official in line would be the solicitor general  noel j. francisco  a former white house and justice department lawyer under mr. bush. mr. trump sought to have mr. mueller fired last june but backed down after his white house counsel  donald f. mcgahn ii  threatened to quit. the president told the times a month later that mr. mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with russia. the white house made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the trump organization crossed that red line  but mr. trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful to the special counsel. his focus on democrats working for mr. mueller could be aimed at demonstrating conflict of interest that would merit dismissal. when mr. mueller assembled his team  he surrounded himself with trusted former colleagues and experts on specific crimes like money laundering. as the team filled out  republican allies of mr. trump noted that some members had previously contributed to democratic candidates. in particular  republicans pointed to andrew weissmann  who served as f.b.i. general counsel under mr. mueller. mr. weissmann is a career prosecutor but  while in private law practice  donated thousands of dollars toward president barack obama’s election effort. advertisement in his sunday morning twitter blasts  mr. trump also renewed his attacks on james b. comey  the former f.b.i. director  and andrew g. mccabe  his former deputy  both of whom  like mr. mueller  are longtime republicans. mr. trump fired mr. comey last may  at first attributing the decision to the f.b.i. director’s handling of the investigation into hillary clinton’s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the russia investigation in mind when he made the decision. mr. sessions  under intense public pressure from mr. trump  fired mr. mccabe on friday after an inspector general found that he had not been forthcoming about authorizing f.b.i. officials to provide information about the clinton inquiry in 2016 to a reporter. “wow  watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked ‘have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?’” mr. trump wrote. “he said strongly ‘never  no.’ he lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.” mr. trump went on to dismiss reports that mr. mccabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy f.b.i. director  just as mr. comey did. mr. mccabe left those memos with the f.b.i.  which means mr. mueller’s team has access to them. “spent very little time with andrew mccabe  but he never took notes when he was with me ” mr. trump wrote. “i don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda  probably at a later date. same with lying james comey. can we call them fake memos?” michael r. bromwich  mr. mccabe’s lawyer  fired back by accusing the president of corrupting the law enforcement system. “we will not be responding to each childish  defamatory  disgusting & false tweet by the president ” he wrote on twitter. “the whole truth will come out in due course. but the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the entire process that led to mr. mccabe’s termination and has rendered it illegitimate.” in suggesting that mr. comey lied under oath to congress  mr. trump appeared to refer to a comment by mr. mccabe that the former director had authorized the news media interaction at the heart of the complaint against him. the president’s republican allies picked up the point on sunday and pressed for appointment of a prosecutor to look at the origin of the russia investigation. “so we know that mccabe has lied” because the inspector general concluded he had not been fully candid  representative kevin mccarthy of california  the house majority leader  said on fox news. “now he’s saying about comey — comey may have lied as well. so i don’t think this is the end of it. but that’s why we need a second special counsel.” other republicans  however  suggested that the trump administration was going too far. senator marco rubio of florida criticized the decision to fire mr. mccabe on a friday night shortly before his retirement took effect  jeopardizing his pension. advertisement “i don’t like the way it happened ” mr. rubio said on “meet the press” on nbc. “he should’ve been allowed to finish through the weekend.” speaking of the president  he added: “obviously he doesn’t like mccabe and he’s made that pretty clear now for over a year. we need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.” sheryl gay stolberg contributed to this report. follow peter baker on twitter: @peterbakernyt. a version of this article

politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by steven buser as a psychiatrist for the united states air force  one of my responsibilities was evaluating the mental stability of airmen who handled nuclear weapons  using the standards laid out in what is called the nuclear personnel reliability program. there is no need to justify why our military would take every precaution necessary to ensure that the men and women in uniform handling nuclear weapons were fit to do so  whether they were in charge of a missile silo or loading nuclear bombs onto aircraft — or giving the orders to them  on up the chain of command. strangely  the commander-in-chief  the one who would decide when and how to use those weapons  is the only individual in the chain who is not subject to the ongoing certification under the program. according to the program  or p.r.p.  personnel who handle nuclear weapons are held to higher standards of physical and mental readiness than other personnel  and rightfully so. the department of defense directive 5210.42 states: “only those personnel who have demonstrated the highest degree of individual reliability for allegiance  trustworthiness  conduct  behavior  and responsibility shall be allowed to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons  and they shall be continuously evaluated for adherence to p.r.p. standards.” on tuesday the white house physician  rear admiral ronny jackson  gave the president a clean bill of health. and no doubt  by many standards  mr. trump is in decent shape. but the standards for a person’s physical and mental health are a different matter from his fitness to oversee our nuclear arsenal. what if president trump were  instead  airman trump  and was to be assessed under the program’s guidelines; would i certify him as “p.r.p. ready” to work in the vicinity of nuclear weapons? i have not had the opportunity to examine the president personally  but warning signs abound. what if i had reliable outside information that airman trump displayed erratic emotions? that i saw very clearly that he was engaging in cyberbullying on twitter? that he had repeatedly made untruthful or highly distorted statements? that his language implied he engaged in sexually abusive behavior? that he appeared paranoid about being surveilled or persecuted by others  that he frequently disregarded or violated the rights of others? these are the sorts of things that set off alarms for air force psychiatrists. i certainly could not certify him as “p.r.p. ready” without more extensive psychological evaluation. it does not take a former air force psychiatrist to point out that our country finds itself in a place unlike any we’ve ever been before. saturday morning’s alarm in hawaii  as residents read alerts that incoming ballistic missiles were on their way  is a wakeup call to the very real danger we’re facing. global tension and angst are significantly heightened. we’ve been here a few times before  but unlike those other times our commander-in-chief adds  without equivocation  to this angst almost daily with his words and actions. we have always assumed that the person at the top has the mental fitness to meet whatever standards the air force set for the rest of the chain of command. what keeps me up at night? the realization that  at the worst possible time  we have a chief executive who i believe would probably fail the p.r.p. the topic of presidential fitness and cognitive decline has always been a legitimate issue. the ability for the executive office to function effectively and without exposing the american people to undue danger relies on the mental faculties of the one person inhabiting its walls. former president jimmy carter pointed this out in an article he wrote for the journal of the american medical association in 1994  in which he warned that our country is in “continuing danger” from the possibility that a president could become disabled “particularly by a neurological illness.” revelations that president ronald reagan may have had early-stage alzheimer’s while he was president add to these concerns. it’s unlikely that the military will act on its own to require the president to submit to an air force psychiatrist’s evaluation. but there are other options. a bill in the house  with support in the senate  called the restricting first use of nuclear weapons act of 2017  explicitly prevents any president from initiating a nuclear first strike without congressional approval. this should be common sense for any politician to support  because it assures that the checks and balances intended by the framers of the constitution remain intact. but equally important  it remedies a glaring failure within the nuclear chain of command and mitigates one of the greatest dangers of our nuclear ages: the possibility of an unhinged president executing a calamitous decision that endangers millions of americans  and potentially millions of others around the globe. no president  including mr. trump  should have the unilateral power to begin a nuclear war. congress must protect the american people  and taking away the option of an impulsive first strike nuclear attack is a clear and sane way to prevent a dangerous and insane result. steven buser is a clinical psychiatrist and a former major in the united states air force. he is an editor  with leonard cruz  of “a clear and present danger: narcissism in the era of president trump.” follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options

politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by tim weiner president trump entered office last year as a singular figure. but he has come to resemble two of his predecessors in one crucial respect. though he’s more paranoid than richard nixon and more mendacious than bill clinton  he seems bent on following them down a road to hell: a confrontation with the federal bureau of investigation. like them  he’ll lose. he might win the battle with the bureau over the pending release of a scurrilous memo concocted by republicans on the house intelligence committee  a cudgel created to attack everyone who’s been in charge of the federal investigation of team trump. he may try to fire them all. but he won’t win the war. we have a good idea what’s in the poison-pen four-page memo. it sets out a conspiracy theory about a 2016 national-security wiretap on the once-obscure trump campaign aide carter page. it argues  essentially  that the deputy attorney general  rod rosenstein  and f.b.i. leaders deceived the federal judge who approved the wiretap warrant and extended it in 2017. the bureau called the memo materially false and misleading in an extraordinary unsigned statement on wednesday afternoon. christopher wray  whom mr. trump installed after defenestrating james comey  has personally emphasized the danger of releasing the memo. the justice department said releasing the document would be “extraordinarily reckless.” and yet mr. trump has signaled his desire to see it made public  unredacted. he clearly sees the memo as a weapon of political warfare — a way to rid himself of mr. rosenstein  who oversees both the f.b.i. and the special prosecutor investigating the white house  robert mueller. mr. rosenstein has made it clear that he will not fire mr. mueller at the president’s whim — which  to the president  means he needs to go. if he ousts mr. rosenstein  he might conceivably find a replacement somewhere in the bowels of the justice department. he’d want a stooge  a willing executioner  more loyal to him than to the constitution — someone to blindly do his bidding  fire mr. mueller  and suppress the f.b.i. agents leading the investigation of the white house. mr. trump has been transparent in his antagonism. it is not a disinterested belief that the bureau is corrupt and in need of reform. he’d been in office for only four days when f.b.i. agents came to the white house to interview the national security adviser  mike flynn  who’d engaged in skulduggery with russia. mr. flynn lied to the f.b.i. in that moment  the counterintelligence case became a criminal case focusing on the white house. ever since  the president has done nearly everything in his power to subvert and sabotage the investigators. he fired mr. comey for refusing to scuttle the case — and then denounced him as a blackmailing liar. he has denounced the bureau and its leaders in tweets and interviews  and in quickly leaked comments to white house officials. he now stands on the verge of re-enacting the saturday night massacre  when nixon forced out his own attorney general and the next man in line in order to sack the special prosecutor investigating watergate. nixon’s willing executioner back in the october 1973 was the no. 3 man at justice  the solicitor general robert bork. at the end of that fateful night  nixon promised him the next seat on the supreme court. it worked out badly for all concerned — nixon resigned anyway  and bork’s actions were a major strike against him in his unsuccessful nomination to the court. where’s mr. trump’s bork? could it be the associate attorney general  rachel lee brand  a former professor at the antonin scalia law school and now the third-ranking justice department official? would she want to carry the same weight under which bork labored for all his life? maybe. but as nixon learned  the president can’t fire his way out of this crisis. despite the degradations and depredations that this president has inflicted on the executive branch  there remains a phalanx of honorable people at the justice department and the f.b.i. more beholden to principle than politics  prepared to fall on their swords rather than suborn high crimes. mr. wray is one. when he was sworn in four months ago  he told an audience of f.b.i. agents that he was going to uphold the constitution and follow the rule of law. “we’re going to follow the facts independently  no matter where they lead  no matter who likes it ” he said. “and we’re going to always  always pursue justice.” the framers of the constitution contemplated there would be times like this. though they failed to foresee a leader quite like donald trump — a man more akin to the mad king george of england than to madison and jefferson — they knew not every president would be enlightened. but they did not dream any would be so benighted  so blind as to place personal loyalty above the rule of law. the president has measured mr. mueller for the guillotine for months. as the bloodhounds close in on the oval office  he may sharpen his blade and place the prosecutor’s head on a pike. if so  he’ll have to confront the constitution. and he’ll lose again. tim weiner  a former national security correspondent for the new york times  is the author of “enemies: a history of the f.b.i.” and “one man against the world: the tragedy of richard nixon.” follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by katherine rosman and jacob bernsteinmarch 22  2018  last week  after more than 12 years of marriage  vanessa trump filed for an uncontested divorce in manhattan from donald trump jr.  the eldest son of the president. in a joint statement  the couple said: “we have decided to go our separate ways.” “an uncontested divorce is the much saner and healthier way of doing things  which makes it unusual for the trump family ” said kenneth burrows  a new york matrimonial lawyer who is not involved in the case. precisely because of the trump family’s reputation for chaos — not to mention that the trump organization  which is being run by mr. trump and his brother eric  has been subpoenaed  by the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii — the divorce announcement only served to foster curiosity about ms. trump  who has been something of a lesser-known member of the family. one detail that has been closely scrutinized is ms. trump’s selection of a lawyer  david feureisen  who has a background in civil  criminal and divorce cases but is not a boldface name. he works in westchester county  n.y.  and has a low profile in the media. (he did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment.) advertisement in addition to handling ms. trump’s divorce  mr. feureisen also represented ms. trump’s mother  bonnie kay haydon  in a recent real estate transaction. in september  ms. haydon  who is living in a rental apartment  paid $6.4 million in a cash deal for a three-bedroom condominium on fifth avenue and 86th street with two terraces and a library. the apartment  which is undergoing a renovation  was purchased from elizabeth ailes  the widow of the former fox news executive roger ailes  said carol staab  ms. ailes’s real estate broker. advertisement ms. haydon said in an email that the family would not be making any statements. “we all love vanessa  and support her in any way we can ” she wrote. the trump organization did not comment. ms. trump  40  grew up in manhattan. her father  charles haydon (born charles hochman)  was a lawyer. his clients included solomon schwartz  who in the 1980s was charged with trying to smuggle 500 rifles and ammunition into poland  and abe hirschfeld  the eccentric real estate mogul who was tried for tax fraud but not convicted. her mother  around 30 years his junior  ran kay models  a small modeling agency. growing up  ms. trump was not a particularly distinguished student. she attended the dwight school on the upper west side. in her high school yearbook  ms. trump was described both as most likely to “be on ricki lake” and to “get a divorce.” after high school  ms. trump was a model with wilhelmina models  the agency once known for representing supermodels including iman. in the late 1990s  ms. trump and her younger sister  veronika  became fixtures of the manhattan party scene  hanging out at bottle service clubs during the era of moomba and veruka. “they were pretty girls who liked getting photographed ” said lizzie grubman  the publicist  who sometimes squired them around and said she couldn’t now remember whether she was paid to do publicity for the sisters or simply helped them out. during that time  the sisters had several turns in the tabloids. according to a 1998 item in star  leonardo dicaprio was said to have “fallen hard for a stunning young model” named vanessa haydon. mr. dicaprio’s publicist later said  “he never dated her.” a former classmate from dwight told new york magazine  “vanessa played the media really well.” advertisement not long after veronika finished high school  she had a child with the restaurateur stratis morfogen. in 2001  she and her sister showed up in a new york post story after visiting the conscience point inn in the hamptons with mr. morfogen. that night  he had an unfortunate run-in with a bouncer. he also opened an unruly nightclub called sessa  the name that veronika haydon’s daughter  who was 3 at the time  used for her aunt because she couldn’t pronounce her full name. mr. morfogen and veronika haydon later got divorced. he now operates a restaurant on east 60th street. donald trump jr. entered vanessa’s life at a 2003 fashion show for a kmart brand at capitale  a nightclub on the lower east side; the brand was fronted by the musician thalía. ms. grubman was representing the brand and sitting near the elder mr. trump  who introduced vanessa to his son twice that evening. the couple made headlines with their engagement in 2004. the younger mr. trump proposed with a $100 000 ring that he got for free by agreeing to stage his proposal before paparazzi at the short hills mall where the jeweler of the ring  bailey banks & biddle  was located. the move frustrated his father  who complained about it on “larry king live.” (the publicity ploy ultimately didn’t work. by 2009  bailey banks & biddle was in bankruptcy and the short hills location was closed.) the couple was married at mar-a-lago in november 2005. during the ceremony  guests including bo dietl  the police detective turned tv commentator  and sophie dahl  the model and author  were seated around a swimming pool. christine schott  who at the time worked as a model manager and publicist for ms. trump  was there  and staying at mar-a-lago. she spent at least some of the night helping the press keep straight which blond matron was the bride’s mother and which was the groom’s. “the paparazzi kept having to ask me who was who because ivana looked so much like vanessa’s mother ” she said. “they both were tall with big blond buns.” ms. schott recalled seeing the elder mr. trump and introducing herself as the bride’s publicist. “the president said  ‘vanessa has a publicist?’” ms. schott said. “he was annoyed.” ms. schott  who is now starting a business to help the careers of beauty influencers  also recalled that it was a happy occasion for the new ms. trump. “vanessa was very loving  she was very much in love with donnie  she was excited to become a trump ” ms. schott said. “she told me at the wedding that she wanted five children. she was very specific about that. not three  not four  but five.” about a year and a half into the marriage  ms. trump gave birth to the couple’s first child  a daughter named kai. four more children followed over the next seven years. the lifestyle newsletter from the styles  travel and food sections  offering the latest trends to news you can use. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. since her marriage  ms. trump  who once actively sought the spotlight  has become less of a public figure. she is described as an involved  doting mother and is often seen at school for drop-offs and pickups. advertisement at the same time  her husband  who was something of a black sheep  became his father’s most ardent supporter  including appearing on “the apprentice ” his father’s television show. because of his appearances on tv  mr. dietl said  women were “throwing themselves” at the younger mr. trump. when his father ran for president  mr. trump emerged as a strident voice on social media and the campaign trail. “he’s never around ” mr. dietl said. “i definitely had that sense.” the pressure of being part of the first family has taken a toll on ms. trump  people who know her say. in february  she was understandably rattled when she opened a letter addressed to her husband that had been sent to her mother’s rental apartment. white powder spilled out. both ms. trump and her mother were taken to a hospital; the powder was later revealed to be cornstarch. ms. schott said that early on  ms. trump was concerned about her husband’s big-game hunting. “i know she wasn’t thrilled that he hunted as he did ” ms. schott said. “i know she wanted to keep it on the dl. she knew that was going to be a big issue  socially.” ms. trump appears to have been raised in a more liberal family than that of her estranged husband. less than a month after president trump was inaugurated  ms. haydon  ms. trump’s mother  posted a story on facebook headlined  “i’m an american living in sweden. here’s why i came to embrace the higher taxes.” ms. haydon’s public facebook is usually confined to family pictures and the occasional viral video  although in 2015 she reposted a meme from an account called occupy democrats that mocked american appetites for assault rifles — and another meme  from daily kos  that showed republican politicians  including speaker of the house paul d. ryan  with the text “people without vaginas shouldn’t be able to regulate them.” even so  ms. trump wasn’t averse to appearing by the family’s side  both in the flesh and on social media  throughout the campaign’s various milestones. as for ms. trump’s future  ms. schott has high hopes. “i think she could still have a nice career ” she said. “she could be a mommy blogger and she could take on a cause. she is in a position to do something great.” an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a 2001 encounter between the restaurateur stratis morfogen and a bouncer. mr. morfogen accused the bouncer of putting him in a chokehold  but the two did not fight. with additional reporting by doris burke. a version of this article appears in print on march 25  2018  on page st1 of the new york edition with the headline: a trump  is exiting  the family.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page »

politics,advertisement by danny hakim and matthew rosenbergmarch 17  2018  when the russia question came up during a hearing at the british parliament last month  alexander nix did not hesitate. “we’ve never worked in russia ” said mr. nix  head of a data consulting firm that advised the trump campaign on targeting voters. “as far as i’m aware  we’ve never worked for a russian company ” mr. nix added. “we’ve never worked with a russian organization in russia or any other country  and we don’t have any relationship with russia or russian individuals.” but mr. nix’s business did have some dealings with russian interests  according to company documents and interviews. advertisement mr. nix is a director of scl group  a british political and defense contractor  and chief executive of its american offshoot  cambridge analytica  which advised the trump campaign. the firms’ employees  who often overlap  had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from lukoil  the russian oil giant. advertisement lukoil was interested in how data was used to target american voters  according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with lukoil executives in london and turkey. scl and lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature  and scl also said there were no meetings in london. the contacts took place as cambridge analytica was building a roster of republican clients in the united states — and harvesting the facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters’ behavior. cambridge analytica also included extensive questions about russia’s president  vladimir v. putin  in surveys it was carrying out in american focus groups in 2014. it is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning  which asked for views on topics ranging from mr. putin’s popularity to russian expansionism. on two promotional documents obtained by the new york times  scl said it did business in russia. in both documents  the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of scl clients  with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. in a statement  scl said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in russia.” cambridge analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election. while mr. nix’s firm turned over some records to the house permanent select committee on intelligence during its investigation of russian interference  democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “it is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to cambridge analytica ” they said in a report this month. asked about the russian oil company  a spokesman for scl said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping lukoil turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” the spokesman said scl was not ultimately hired. arash repac  chief executive of lukoil eurasia petrol  offered a different explanation for the talks. he said that a meeting he attended with scl in turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

ahead  we decided not to cooperate with scl. no contracts were signed.” advertisement but christopher wylie  who helped found cambridge analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology  said lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to american voters. “i remember being super confused ” said mr. wylie  who took part in one of the lukoil meetings. “i kept asking alexander  ‘can you explain to me what they want?’” he said  referring to mr. nix. “i don’t understand why lukoil wants to know about political targeting in america.” “we’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting ” mr. wylie said  adding that lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially. mr. wylie  a former contractor  left scl before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. he had a falling out with scl and tried to set up a rival business. scl said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company. a second person familiar with the discussions backed up mr. wylie’s account  but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement. though lukoil is not state-owned  it depends on kremlin support  and its chief executive  vagit alekperov  has met with mr. putin on a number of occasions. reuters reported last year that lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to russian leadership. nicholas confessore contributed reporting. a version of this article appears in print on march 19  2018  on page a11 of the new york edition with the headline: firm aiding trump

politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by anthony atamanuik for the past three years  i have spent the majority of my days moving through the world doing an impression of donald trump. i have coifed  combed and caressed a gravity-defying pompadour  teetered over my own midsection in a pisa-like lean and narrowed my eyes into a leering squint. most of the time  i did this on comedy central’s “the president show ” and i hope i don’t sound too much like my avatar when i say i portray both his body and his mind with relative accuracy. i’ve studied our president’s bizarrely lyrical speech patterns and his unconsciously betraying body movements. i have learned that he is speaking with his body language as much as he is with his mouth. as you prepare to watch our 45th president deliver his first state of the union on tuesday night  you can refer to this primer as a means of reconciling his body language and speech patterns. it should provide insight into what the president is really saying. when the sergeant-at-arms barks our president into the house chamber  i can promise you that mr. trump’s mind is mostly focused on getting down the slight slope leading toward the podium. i’ve watched hundreds of hours of him managing inclines and declines and even after 70-plus years on the planet  he still struggles with that. he never seems particularly steady  and i’ll leave you to make the associations between his instability and his lack of a moral center. while most presidents take this opportunity to glad-hand members of congress  in similar situations  mr. trump uses people as a hand railing. this creates a deep conflict between his desire to not fall down and his germophobic tendencies that no doubt contributes to his discomfort. this is a combination of the physical and mental. the president is obviously aware that he’s being observed  but his insecurity over his lack of total control regarding how he’s perceived translates into muttering and self-effacing glances to anyone in his line of sight. his face usually reads: “can you believe this? ” “i hope i make it up these stairs ” “mike  help me get up the stairs for christ’s sake!” mr. trump’s instinct is to pad all experiences with a sense of pre-embarrassment so that he can exert more control if something unexpected happens. in short  the mantra behind everything he does is  “i meant to do that!” this was the first and most important physical trait i perfected in playing mr. trump. he pitches forward on the balls of his feet  his hands curled and locked at his waist. it is his most relaxed standing position. if you place him in a church with a choir  his lean turns into something resembling swaying — he’ll move back and forth to the music with marionette arms lifelessly swinging somewhat like pig carcasses in a meat freezer. the most likely time to see the trump lean™ is right before he’s announced into the chamber  or before he turns to stand at the lectern. donald trump doesn’t like to turn his head. instead  he turns his entire upper body and shoulders  leaning his head forward like a pigeon eyeing stale bread crust. he obviously wants to stabilize himself at the lectern for fear of falling over  and his rigid upper body is like that of a litigious courtroom charlatan strapped in a neck brace checking to see if people believe him. president trump reads from a teleprompter in the cadence of a grandmother reading “goodnight moon.” he rarely seems familiar with the material. if he likes a line or idea in the speech  he’ll take a moment to repeat it and savor it — it’s as if he’s hearing it for the first time  because it’s the first time he’s reading it. like bugs bunny conducting an orchestra  mr. trump conducts many of his statements too. the open palm is a plea to his audience to connect with his plight. the o.k. symbol is reserved for telling specific lies. the thumbs-up-moving-into-a-flat-palm is used to cover dead space — either during cheering or when he’s interrupted by protesters. many liberal analysts have interpreted the president’s wandering speech patterns as a sign of dementia or stupidity  or even as some sort of folksy  working-class vernacular. but those views are mistaken. the president is simply speaking to himself. the audience is a bystander to this outward internal dialogue. when he discovers a particularly interesting phrase or concept  he will repeat it  building his idea in front of you. “believe me” is part guarantee and part buttress to a falsehood. while studying mr. trump during the 2016 campaign  i realized that his greatest asset lay in his ability to make his story his followers’ story as well. he began nearly every rally reminding viewers that there were 17 republican primary candidates  that he came in second in iowa  first in new hampshire and “beat them all.” he still repeats this from time to time. mr. trump hides in plain sight  saying with his body exactly what he’s going to do and how he’s going to do it. his movements are rooted in his physical insecurity. while he wears a “tough guy” mask  his movements have the quality of an old dowager who has taken the carriage into town to mix with the common people. how can this help you when you listen to him? just remember: every day is opposite day with the president. when he says something isn’t true  it probably is. no matter what he’s saying  his body is telling the world  “i’m pretending  i’m scared and i’m totally unprepared.” anthony atamanuik plays donald trump on “the president show.” follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by by frank bruni rome — i consider myself an adventurer  especially on the culinary front. i have consumed livers  kidneys and brains. i have eaten an amazonian herb that numbs your tongue  which sort of nullifies the point of eating  and i have tried shrimp that were still alive — still wriggling — until the downward chomp of my incisors. but on a recent visit here  i had pasta alla gricia on the first night  then pasta alla gricia on the second night  then pasta alla gricia on the third and fourth. there’s only one possible explanation  which is of course donald trump. before i elaborate on that  i should explain pasta alla gricia. it doesn’t enjoy the fame outside of italy that it deserves. it’s essentially pasta alla carbonara minus the egg: less gooeyness  less guilt. “lighter than carbonara” is how i often describe it  although that’s like saying “humbler than trump.” the bar is low  and everything’s relative. it can be made with bucatini. it can be made with rigatoni. it could probably be made with shoelaces and still be worth ordering. it’s proof  like many italian delicacies  that the communion of fat (it’s studded with crispy bits of pork cheek) and salt (it’s deluged with pecorino cheese) is the most reliable ticket to heaven. and it was one of my go-to dishes when i lived here many years ago. but four dinners in a row? that was unheard-of. it made me realize how much i relish constancy now. and it got me to thinking about how underrated sameness is. when trump came down that escalator in june 2015  he was inconstancy. he was newness. sure  he’d been around forever  a fixed star in the celebrity firmament. but trump as a politician  let alone as a president  hinged on a hankering for novelty and an itch to trash the status quo in favor of the great orange unknown. before his election  supporters of his told me that they didn’t think him perfect and weren’t even certain of his competence  but hey  could american government get any worse? why not toss the pieces up just to see where they land? these voters viewed what they were doing as bold. they weren’t wrong. but boldness and recklessness overlap. and here we are. we lurch from one surprise  provocation and scandal to the next. tariffs today  the execution of drug dealers tomorrow. stormy daniels at the moment  stormy weather all the time. administration officials turn over at a breakneck pace. (farewell  rex tillerson.) traditional presidential etiquette is gone. so are traditional presidential ethics. we got our taste of the untried. dear god  is it sour. italians are more practiced at such tumult. over the past 25 years  italy has changed prime ministers 13 times. it has swung this way and that. at this point it’s more or less dangling: the nascent  renegade party that got the most votes in the recent election  the five star movement  lacks a majority  not to mention a workable agenda  and doesn’t have a coalition partner. there’s no clear national purpose  no steady national trajectory  no sturdy sense of control. italians wait  somewhat helplessly  to see what happens next. but their rituals  their families and their food — these are governable and protectable across time. they’re the engines of stability. they’re the agents of solace. italians cling to them more fiercely  and with greater pride  than we americans embrace our kin and our ways. i used to view this with a mixture of admiration and ridicule. when i lived in rome  i often groused about how many restaurants had almost identical menus and how inviolable the rules and rhythm of italian meals could be. cappuccino at breakfast but never after dinner. beer with pizza but not with pasta. on return trips to the eternal city  i occasionally rolled my eyes at the changelessness of it all. here a carbonara  there a gricia  everywhere a cacio e pepe. italians  i decided  wanted for imagination. they lacked daring. maybe so. but this time around i felt only respect and gratitude for what they do have: the discernment to recognize a sweet spot — or rather  a fatty  salty one — when they find it and the wisdom not to abandon it on the unsupported chance that there’s better around the bend. and so i kept happily to routine. i walked the roman paths that were most familiar and dearest to me  lingered in the roman piazzas that had given me pleasure before and supped not just on the classics but on one classic in particular: gricia. it was my link to a calmer past and my thread through a turbulent present. i can’t predict where  politically  italy or america is headed. i can’t inoculate myself against trump’s coming tweets. but i can count on what happens when pork cheek meets pecorino. i can plant myself at that juncture. and i can stand still. i invite you to follow me on twitter (@frankbruni) and join me on facebook. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options

russian counterpart  vladimir putin  for his victory in a rigged election  even after mr. trump’s national security staff warned him not to. “i think he’s afraid of the president of russia ” mr. brennan said  on msnbc’s “morning joe” program  of the phone call on tuesday between the two presidents. “the russians  i think  have had long experience with mr. trump and may have things they could expose.” the possibility that mr. putin could have some hold on the american president has lurked in the background over the past year as mr. trump displayed a mystifying affection for the russian leader and ignored or excused his aggressive behavior and nefarious activities  most important  his interference in the 2016 campaign  a subject of the special counsel robert mueller’s investigation. some trump defenders noted that president barack obama also called mr. putin when he was elected president in 2012. but the circumstances are very different. in the intervening years  mr. putin has become an increasingly authoritarian leader who has crushed most of his political opposition and engineered a deeply lopsided re-election this week. american intelligence officials say they are certain that he meddled in the 2016 american election on behalf of mr. trump and is trying to meddle again in the 2018 election  as well as in many european elections. russia annexed crimea in 2014  is waging war in other parts of ukraine and is enabling president bashar al-assad in syria. while the administration recently imposed its first significant sanctions on russia for election interference and other malicious cyberattacks and has faulted russia for the poisoning of a former russian spy and his daughter in britain  mr. trump has refrained from criticizing mr. putin or calling him to account. the phone call reinforced that approach. what mr. trump didn’t say to mr. putin was as significant as what he did say. he did not demand that mr. putin stop meddling in american elections or others  he did not even raise moscow’s role in the poisoning. he made no mention of the unfair political system that deprives russians of a real say in their government. the white house press secretary  sarah huckabee sanders  later reinforced mr. trump’s lack of interest  telling reporters it was not america’s place to question how other countries conduct their elections. the disparity between mr. trump and his advisers  who seem to take threats from russia more seriously  is becoming more pronounced. a senior administration official told the times that mr. trump didn’t want to antagonize mr. putin because fostering rapport is the only way to improve relations between the two countries. on tuesday  the president said he hoped to meet mr. putin soon and discuss preventing an arms race — an arms race both leaders have encouraged with loose talk and investment in new weapons. engaging russia and preventing an arms race are undeniably important. but it’s hard to see how praising and appeasing a bully will advance american interests. that’s not the approach mr. trump has taken with adversaries like north korea or iran  or  for that matter  even with some allies. while mr. trump panders to mr. putin  his criticism of mr. mueller is becoming harsher  as the investigation raises increasingly serious concerns about a web of ties connecting mr. trump’s associates to russia. mr. trump’s former national security adviser  michael flynn  has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with russia. a former foreign policy adviser  george papadopoulos  has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with russians. a former deputy campaign chairman  rick gates  who had his own russian connections along with a now-indicted former campaign chairman  paul manafort  has pleaded guilty to lying about russian-related matters. mr. mueller has subpoenaed mr. trump’s company for any documents involving russia. democrats on the house intelligence committee say mr. trump was “actively negotiating a business deal in moscow with a sanctioned russian bank” during the 2016 campaign season. and mr. mueller has charged 13 russians with conspiring to subvert the 2016 election and put mr. trump in the white house. mr. brennan’s fears clearly arise from some of these elements. mr. brennan knows more than most about possible threats to america  but he is not the only one speaking out. senator john mccain  republican of arizona  slammed mr. trump  saying “an american president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.” even the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  who rarely crosses mr. trump  said calling mr. putin “wouldn’t have been high on my list.” if mr. trump isn’t mr. putin’s lackey  it’s past time for him to prove it. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  opinionvideo advertisement

politics,advertisement by nicholas fandos and katie bennermarch 28  2018  washington — the justice department’s inspector general  facing increasing political pressure from republicans in congress and attorney general jeff sessions  said on wednesday that his office would investigate the surveillance of a former trump campaign official. the announcement came amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the white house and republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel’s investigation into russian interference in the presidential election. the inspector general  michael e. horowitz  said he would examine whether law enforcement officials complied with the law and departmental policies in seeking permission from the foreign intelligence surveillance court to wiretap the former campaign adviser  carter page. law enforcement officials had long had concerns that mr. page  a former investment banker based in moscow  was acting as a russian agent. republicans have seized on details about the court-ordered surveillance of mr. page as evidence that the justice department abused its authority in the russia investigation. mr. horowitz did not name mr. page in his announcement. advertisement mr. horowitz said he would also review what the justice department and the f.b.i. knew at the time about a former british spy and longtime f.b.i. source  christopher steele  who provided information about mr. page that was included in the surveillance application. advertisement republicans on capitol hill welcomed the decision but acknowledged that it fell short of demands by three republican committee chairmen that the justice department appoint a second special counsel to investigate the accusations of surveillance abuses. “this is not a substitute for a special counsel to investigate this and other matters ” said representative robert w. goodlatte of virginia  the chairman of the house judiciary committee  adding that the inspector general’s office “does not have authority to compel witness interviews  including from past employees  so its investigation will be limited in scope in comparison to a special counsel investigation.” democrats feared that the investigation would further politicize a justice department that seems intent on appeasing president trump. but they said they were confident that the review would confirm that the department and the f.b.i. had acted properly. “any objective review of these claims should tell us what we already know — that the f.b.i. was right  that there was sufficient evidence to continue investigating certain trump campaign officials for their connections to the russian government  and that the republicans are desperate to distract from that investigation ” said representative jerrold nadler of new york  the top democrat on the house judiciary committee. mr. horowitz’s office is in the final stages of another high-profile investigation studying several contentious decisions made at the f.b.i. and justice department during the 2016 presidential campaign. findings from one piece of that investigation prompted the firing this month of the former f.b.i. deputy director  andrew g. mccabe. mr. horowitz is expected to release a broader report on his entire review in the coming weeks. the decision punctuated a year of attacks by mr. trump on the justice department and the special counsel investigation. mr. mccabe  who as a former top f.b.i. official is a potential witness in the inquiry  insisted he was fired in an effort to discredit any testimony he might give. the debate over the surveillance of mr. page exploded into public view in january when republicans on the house intelligence committee revealed that they had assembled a classified memo accusing law enforcement leaders of abusing their power to spy on mr. page. advertisement the document’s chief claim was that the officials repeatedly used unsubstantiated democratic-funded opposition research from mr. steele to obtain the surveillance warrant without adequately explaining to the judge the source of the information. mr. trump declassified the memo over the objections of the f.b.i.  which said it had “grave concerns” over its accuracy  a rare public break from the white house. once it was released  mr. trump enthusiastically trumpeted it as evidence that the russia investigation had been concocted to smear him politically. what you need to know to start your day  delivered to your inbox monday through friday. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please

offering a point-by-point refutation of the republican document and blasting it as an intentionally misleading attempt to undermine the russia investigation. they said law enforcement officials acted properly in seeking permission to spy on mr. page. former career prosecutors said that the accusations of surveillance abuse had eroded trust in the justice department. “this is a continuation of a coordinated effort to discredit the special counsel’s work through political attacks on career public servants in the f.b.i. ” said christopher hunter  a former f.b.i. agent and federal prosecutor who left the justice department last year. “sow disinformation  discredit the f.b.i. and the justice department in the minds of our own american citizens  all to undermine the special counsel and create an environment of confusion and doubt about the legitimacy of the special counsel’s work — that’s what russian intelligence would do to destabilize our society  yet that’s what’s being done by our own government officials and their collaborators.” mr. sessions has tried to strike a balance between appeasing mr. trump and other conservatives assailing the justice department without alienating the 113 000 or so people who work under him. after the republican congressional memo was released  he said that “no department is perfect” and that the justice department would address lawmakers’ concerns. but house republicans grew frustrated with how the department was handling their concerns over a variety of issues including the surveillance of mr. page  the firing of mr. mccabe and the investigation into hillary clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. in a letter last week to the deputy attorney general  mr. goodlatte said that the department was moving too slowly and he issued a subpoena last week demanding that officials turn over documents related to those issues. the justice department said in a letter sent tuesday to mr. goodlatte that it would work “to enhance the rate of productions ” and that it would schedule a meeting with the committee and the f.b.i. to discuss how the department would further respond to the request. advertisement christopher a. wray  the director of the f.b.i.  said in a news release that he had doubled the number of employees assigned to expedite the request for documents  with a total of 54

politics,advertisement by mark landlerapril 3  2018  washington — president trump has been commander in chief for 14 months  but to an uncanny degree  he still sounds like the armchair statesman who ran for the white house in 2016. “i want to get out ” mr. trump said of the united states’ military engagement in syria  at a news conference on tuesday with leaders of the baltic states. “i want to bring our troops back home.” mr. trump’s words were at odds with the strategy his administration is pursuing in syria. but they were almost verbatim what he said in pre-election tweets  as well as in debates two years ago against republican challengers and his democratic opponent  hillary clinton. far from learning on the job or modifying his views to fit the imperatives of america’s global role — as did so many of his predecessors — mr. trump is falling back on the familiar mix of belligerence and isolationism that fueled his “america first” campaign. advertisement the nato alliance  he said  was “delinquent.” russia is a partner with whom  he insisted  “i think i could have a very good relationship.” the united states should have “kept the oil” after the iraq war. rather than pursuing military adventures abroad  he said  “i want to get back. i want to rebuild our nation.” advertisement mr. trump’s reversion to his campaign themes comes as he has reshuffled his national security team  ousting aides with more conventional views of american power  like secretary of state rex w. tillerson and lt. gen. h. r. mcmaster  the national security adviser  in favor of more hawkish figures  like mike pompeo and john r. bolton. how these new players will mesh with mr. trump’s throwback persona may determine whether the president is signaling a midcourse correction in foreign policy or merely retreating to phrases and positions that give him comfort. mr. tillerson and general mcmaster curbed some of mr. trump’s most radical ideas — convincing him  for example  not to rip up the iran nuclear deal. along with defense secretary jim mattis  they talked him into deploying more troops to afghanistan. mr. pompeo and mr. bolton  analysts predict  will bend more readily to mr. trump’s wishes. add to that a difficult midterm election  which aides say will make the president determined to cater to his political base. and  after more than a year in office  they say mr. trump is more confident that his instincts are the right ones. “he has been very consistent essentially since the 1980s ” said eric s. edelman  a former under secretary of defense for policy in the george w. bush administration. “he knows very little about the world  about history  about the policy details. but he does have strong convictions and they are remarkably durable and apparently impervious to contrary evidence.” they include  mr. edelman said  the belief that his predecessors were gullible  and that he will do better; that allies have exploited the united states  and must pay back their debts; that free trade is bad; and that military force should be used sparingly  but that “we should be strong and scary and that will make people afraid to screw with us.” all those convictions were on vivid display in the east room on tuesday. mr. trump reiterated his contention that the north american free trade agreement is “a phenomenal deal for mexico” and a “horrible deal for the united states.” mexico  he complained  ran a trade surplus of more than $100 billion with the united states. advertisement he claimed that no one had been tougher on russia than him  pointing to his recently passed $700 billion defense budget. but mr. trump said nothing about his administration’s expulsion of 60 russian diplomats as a punishment for the country’s role in a nerve agent attack on a former russian spy and his daughter living in britain.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. “i could have a very good relationship with russia ” he insisted. “and with president putin. and if i did  that would be a great thing.” mr. trump praised his three baltic guests and promised that the united states would be a steadfast ally. but he slammed other nato members for not paying their fair share of the alliance’s costs. nor did mr. trump spare a more favored ally  saudi arabia  which he said was pressing the united states to stay militarily engaged in syria. the white house said the president spoke on monday with king salman of saudi arabia  and mr. trump seemed to refer to the conversation at the news conference. “i said  ‘well  you know  you want us to stay  maybe you’re going to have to pay ’” he recalled. mr. trump’s remarks  which came two weeks after he welcomed the king’s heir  crown prince mohammed bin salman  to the white house  left some senior officials shaking their heads. they also created a split-screen moment that is becoming all too common in washington. even as he was talking about withdrawing the 2 000 remaining united states troops in syria and cutting more than $200 million in recovery aid there  the administration’s point man for combating the islamic state  brett mcgurk  was making the case across town for more aid and troops staying until the job is done. speaking at the united states institute of peace  mr. mcgurk said the $100 million the united states has already spent on recovery aid — used to clear away unexploded bombs and clean up giant piles of war rubble in raqqa — was essential to allow many of the one million displaced residents to return home. mr. trump’s order to suspend the future aid  pending a review  “is not hampering our work in the field ” mr. mcgurk insisted. he also seemed to suggest that american troops were not leaving anytime soon. “we’re in syria to fight isis ” mr. mcgurk said. “that is our mission. our mission isn’t over. we’re going to complete our mission.” advertisement above all  mr. trump has taken pride in delivering on his campaign promises. earlier on tuesday at a working lunch with the baltic leaders  he noted that he had campaigned against trade deficits and was taking aim at them  with china. he has also promised to move the american embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv — and has done so  even at the risk of jeopardizing his goal of a peace deal between israel and the palestinians. but bill clinton and george w. bush both promised to move the embassy during their campaigns  too  only to reverse course later when they realized the costs of such a decision. “the best and most intelligent presidents are adaptive ” said r. nicholas burns  a diplomat who served in the clinton and bush administrations. “they reconsider some of their views from the campaign. i worry that we are looking at someone who is not adaptive — who is not learning on the job.” eric schmitt contributed reporting. a version of this article appears in print on april 4  2018  on page a6 of the new york edition with the headline: on foreign policy  the president reverts to candidate trump.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement supported by letters to the editor: re “an article of impeachment against trump ” by david leonhardt (column  jan. 29): we often say it is the cover-up and not the underlying crime that results in the downfall of those who abuse their office. that may be the case  but only because the cover-up may be a bit easier to prove. president trump fears the f.b.i. and the mueller investigation because he knows more of what he has done than we do. given our politics at the moment  unless those investigations can ultimately give us a clearer picture of what has gone on  he may survive in office. those are the stakes before us. despite what many legal scholars may opine  there is nothing in the constitution that says that a sitting president cannot be indicted in a criminal court. impeachment and indictment are not mutually exclusive. an indictment of a sitting president may be exactly what we need to wake us from the nightmare we are sleeping through. bruce neuman  water mill  n.y. to the editor: re “justice under attack: why does mr. trump fear the truth?” (editorial  jan. 27): your editorial and david leonhardt’s column cite convincing evidence to suggest that president trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice. mr. leonhardt cites as precedent the articles of impeachment against presidents richard nixon and bill clinton. however  neither stresses the most crucial element: what is being obstructed is the investigation into the corruption of our democracy by a hostile foreign power. the clinton impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction never gained traction with the public because the american people recognized that even if the president may have technically violated the law  his actions were never meant to harm the country but were simply efforts to conceal a tawdry consensual dalliance. those who advocate mr. trump’s impeachment must continually stress his effort to harm the united states by preventing the emergence of evidence to explain how our democracy was corrupted by a hostile nation in the 2016 election. harold j. smith  white plains to the editor: re “in congress  only gloom is bipartisan” (news analysis  front page  jan. 28): while we have an embarrassing and dangerous president  talk of impeachment is not the solution. the result would be an even greater problem: mike pence as president. our country can withstand a president who is trying to move the country backward if the constitutional checks and balances are allowed to work. unfortunately a weak congress is not doing its duty. the strident partisan politics has caused gridlock and prevents any significant progress. the real danger to our country is the continued demonization of people with contrasting ideas. the only solution continues to be in the hands of the governed. we must elect a strong collaborative congress that will take the lead and draft laws favored by the large majority of americans and send them to the president with a veto-proof majority. james mcmanusglastonbury  conn. to the editor: re “little urgency by republicans on legislation to protect special counsel” (news article  jan. 29): protect robert mueller? quite to the contrary  republicans are set to release a memo by representative devon nunes’s staff alleging that the f.b.i. abused its powers. this is their last-ditch full-fledged attempt to discredit the russia investigation. president trump will then say he read the memo and it is so disturbing that he has to end this investigation and fire mr. mueller. this is their end game. steve baker  los angeles advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by matthew rosenberg  nicholas confessore and carole cadwalladrmarch 17  2018  (after this story was published  facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the united states and britain. read the latest.) london — as the upstart voter-profiling company cambridge analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 american midterm elections  it had a problem. the firm had secured a $15 million investment from robert mercer  the wealthy republican donor  and wooed his political adviser  stephen k. bannon  with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of american voters and influence their behavior. but it did not have the data to make its new products work. so the firm harvested private information from the facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission  according to former cambridge employees  associates and documents  making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. the breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the american electorate  developing techniques that underpinned its work on president trump’s campaign in 2016. advertisement an examination by the new york times and the observer of london reveals how cambridge analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the atlantic. christopher wylie  who helped found cambridge and worked there until late 2014  said of its leaders: “rules don’t matter for them. for them  this is a war  and it’s all fair.” advertisement “they want to fight a culture war in america ” he added. “cambridge analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.” details of cambridge’s acquisition and use of facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques. but the full scale of the data leak involving americans has not been previously disclosed — and facebook  until now  has not acknowledged it. interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors  and a review of the firm’s emails and documents  have revealed that cambridge not only relied on the private facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove. cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who  facebook says  claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. during a week of inquiries from the times  facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. but on friday  the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. “this was a scam — and a fraud ” paul grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network  said in a statement to the times earlier on friday. he added that the company was suspending cambridge analytica  mr. wylie and the researcher  aleksandr kogan  a russian-american academic  from facebook. “we will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties ” mr. grewal said. advertisement alexander nix  the chief executive of cambridge analytica  and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using facebook data  most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. but in a statement to the times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed mr. kogan for violating facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. in britain  cambridge analytica is facing intertwined investigations by parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “brexit” campaign. the country has strict privacy laws  and its information commissioner announced on saturday that she was looking into whether the facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.” in the united states  mr. mercer’s daughter  rebekah  a board member  mr. bannon and mr. nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns  according to company documents and former employees. congressional investigators have questioned mr. nix about the company’s role in the trump campaign. and the justice department’s special counsel  robert s. mueller iii  has  demanded the emails of cambridge analytica employees who worked for the trump team as part of his investigation into russian interference in the election. while the substance of mr. mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret  documents viewed by the times indicate that the firm’s british affiliate claims to have worked in russia and ukraine. and the wikileaks founder  julian assange  disclosed in october that mr. nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to mr. trump’s democratic opponent  hillary clinton. the documents also raise new questions about facebook  which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of russian propaganda and fake news. the data cambridge collected from profiles  a portion of which was viewed by the times  included details on users’ identities  friend networks and “likes.” only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party. “protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do ” mr. grewal said. “no systems were infiltrated  and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” still  he added  “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.” the bordeaux flowed freely as mr. nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the palace hotel in manhattan in late 2013  mr. wylie recalled in an interview. they had much to celebrate. advertisement mr. nix  a brash salesman  led the small elections division at scl group  a political and defense contractor. he had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data  recruiting mr. wylie  then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of president obama’s campaigns. mr. wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists  some of them affiliated with cambridge university. the group experimented abroad  including in the caribbean and africa  where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing scl were happy to provide government-held data  former employees said. then a chance meeting brought mr. nix into contact with mr. bannon  the breitbart news firebrand who would later become a trump campaign and white house adviser  and with mr. mercer  one of the richest men on earth. do you have the next big story? want to share it with the new york times? we offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists. mr. nix and his colleagues courted mr. mercer  who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in republican politics  and his daughter rebekah  who shared his conservative views. mr. bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift america’s culture and rewire its politics  recalled mr. wylie and other former employees  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. mr. bannon and the mercers declined to comment. mr. mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in virginia’s gubernatorial race in november 2013  where the republican attorney general  ken cuccinelli  ran against terry mcauliffe  the democratic fund-raiser. though mr. cuccinelli lost  mr. mercer committed to moving forward. the mercers wanted results quickly  and more business beckoned. in early 2014  the investor toby neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for senator ted cruz of texas  work that mr. nix was eager to win. when mr. wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to mr. neugebauer  mr. nix castigated them over email. “its 2 pages!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). what have you all been doing??” he wrote. mr. wylie’s team had a bigger problem. building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior. what you need to know to start your day  delivered to your inbox monday through friday. please

were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was  say  a neurotic introvert  a religious extrovert  a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. mr. wylie found a solution at cambridge university’s psychometrics centre. researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on facebook. the researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends  activity that facebook permitted at the time. the approach  the scientists said  could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed. advertisement when the psychometrics centre declined to work with the firm  mr. wylie found someone who would: dr. kogan  who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. dr. kogan built his own app and in june 2014 began harvesting data for cambridge analytica. the business covered the costs — more than $800 000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research  according to company emails and financial records. all he divulged to facebook  and to users in fine print  was that he was collecting information for academic purposes  the social network said. it did not verify his claim. dr. kogan declined to provide details of what happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with facebook and cambridge analytica  though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla facebook app.” he ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  mr. wylie said  a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. of those  roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by the intercept — contained enough information  including places of residence  that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. only about 270 000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested. mr. wylie said the facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the mercers. “we wanted as much as we could get ” he acknowledged. “where it came from  who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.” mr. nix tells a different story. appearing before a parliamentary committee last month  he described dr. kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.” advertisement just as dr. kogan’s efforts were getting underway  mr. mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with scl’s elections division. the partners devised a convoluted corporate structure  forming a new american company  owned almost entirely by mr. mercer  with a license to the psychographics platform developed by mr. wylie’s team  according to company documents. mr. bannon  who became a board member and investor  chose the name: cambridge analytica. the firm was effectively a shell. according to the documents and former employees  any contracts won by cambridge  originally incorporated in delaware  would be serviced by london-based scl and overseen by mr. nix  a british citizen who held dual appointments at cambridge analytica and scl. most scl employees and contractors were canadian  like mr. wylie  or european. but in july 2014  an american election lawyer advising the company  laurence levy  warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in american elections. in a memo to mr. bannon  ms. mercer and mr. nix  the lawyer  then at the firm bracewell & giuliani  warned that mr. nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in united states elections. the data firm would also have to find american citizens or green card holders  mr. levy wrote  “to manage the work and decision making functions  relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.” in summer and fall 2014  cambridge analytica dived into the american midterm elections  mobilizing scl contractors and employees around the country. few americans were involved in the work  which included polling  focus groups and message development for the john bolton super pac  conservative groups in colorado and the campaign of senator thom tillis  the north carolina republican. cambridge analytica  in its statement to the times  said that all “personnel in strategic roles were u.s. nationals or green card holders.” mr. nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an american election campaign  the company said. whether the company’s american ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign  and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under federal election commission rules. cambridge analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle  when the company worked for the campaigns of mr. cruz and then mr. trump. while cambridge hired more americans to work on the races that year  most of its data scientists were citizens of the united kingdom or other european countries  according to two former employees. advertisement under the guidance of brad parscale  mr. trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort  cambridge performed a variety of services  former campaign officials said. that included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals  modeling voter turnout  buying $5 million in television ads and determining where mr. trump should travel to best drum up support. cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. mr. nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape mr. trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model trump voters. in a bbc interview last december  mr. nix said that the trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the cruz campaign. by early 2015  mr. wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. most were liberal-leaning  and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the mercer family favored. cambridge analytica  in its statement  said that mr. wylie had left to start a rival firm  and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. it characterized mr. wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.” near the end of that year  a report in the guardian revealed that cambridge analytica was using private facebook data on the cruz campaign  sending facebook scrambling. in a statement at the time  facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it. facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information  efforts that continued as recently as august 2016. that month  lawyers for the social network reached out to cambridge analytica contractors. “this data was obtained and used without permission ” said a letter that was obtained by the times. “it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.” mr. grewal  the facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement that both dr. kogan and “scl group and cambridge analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.” but copies of the data still remain beyond facebook’s control. the times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles cambridge analytica obtained. advertisement while mr. nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have facebook data  a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on cambridge servers  and that the files were not encrypted. today  as cambridge analytica seeks to expand its business in the united states and overseas  mr. nix has mentioned some questionable practices. this january  in undercover footage filmed by channel 4 news in britain and viewed by the times  he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world  and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. all the scrutiny appears to have damaged cambridge analytica’s political business. no american campaigns or “super pacs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms  and it is unclear whether cambridge will be asked to join mr. trump’s re-election campaign. in the meantime  mr. nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. he has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “math man ” he puts it. in the united states last year  a former employee said  cambridge pitched mercedes-benz  metlife and the brewer ab inbev  but has not signed them on. matthew rosenberg  nicholas confessore and carole

politics,advertisement by peter baker  andrew higgins and steven erlangermarch 30  2018  washington — some senior trump administration officials are pressing for more aggressive action toward russia  hoping to persuade a reluctant president trump to change his approach after a week of mass diplomatic expulsions that have driven the relationship with moscow to its lowest point in decades. with hundreds of diplomats in washington  moscow and european capitals packing their bags as the tensions stemming from the poisoning of a former russian spy living in britain have worsened  the trump team is eyeing additional sanctions and other measures against russia. but while aides say the president has become increasingly convinced that russia is dangerous  he has still refused to embrace a tougher public posture himself and remains uncertain how far to authorize his administration to go. mr. trump has emphasized the importance of dialogue with russia and its president  vladimir v. putin  yet the departure of so many diplomats expelled from both russia and the united states will make it that much harder to maintain a semblance of normal relations between the two countries. cooperation in areas as varied as agriculture  counterterrorism  military affairs and space exploration could diminish  as could private travel and business dealings. the perils of the diplomatic breakdown came into sharper relief on friday. russia’s ambassador in washington lamented that no one would meet with him  and his embassy complained that russian diplomats were being harassed by american intelligence agencies eager to recruit them. advertisement the pentagon  for its part  said that it had no notice of a test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile conducted by russia and announced on friday  a lack of communication that experts worry could lead to miscalculation. advertisement “i don’t remember such bad shape of our relations ” anatoly antonov  the russian ambassador to washington  told nbc’s “today” show. “there is a great mistrust between the united states and russia.” since his arrival last year in washington  mr. antonov said he had invited american officials to his residence only to be repeatedly rebuffed. “if they are scared  i said  ‘come on  we can meet in a restaurant and to discuss all outstanding issues ’” he said. “it was four or five months ago. and i got answer: silent.” american officials said a shift in the administration’s approach has been building for weeks. secretary of state rex w. tillerson  whose last official day on the job is saturday  had come to the conclusion before mr. trump fired him this month that a year of attempting to cooperate had not yielded much success  according to people familiar with his thinking. as a result  they said  mr. tillerson had begun mapping out a tougher policy toward russia and found agreement in the white house. the administration began taking a more robust approach  publicly blaming russia for a devastating attack on computers in ukraine and elsewhere  accusing moscow of trying to break into the united states’ power grid and imposing sanctions in retaliation for russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election in the united states. mr. tillerson’s feelings were hardened further by a conversation with boris johnson  the british foreign secretary who described to him the nerve agent attack on a former russian spy  sergei v. skripal  and his daughter living in britain. even in the hours before his dismissal by mr. trump  mr. tillerson spoke out in stronger terms than the president in condemning the poisoning. while mr. tillerson is on the way out  his designated successor  mike pompeo  and the incoming national security adviser  john r. bolton  are both considered even more hawkish on russia. at the same time  some officials at the pentagon have expressed caution about the escalating conflict with russia  citing consequences in syria  where the united states and russia have both conducted military operations. advertisement the trump administration expelled 60 russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the russian consulate in seattle this week as part of a wider international retaliation for the poisoning of mr. skripal. russia responded thursday by ordering out 60 americans and closing the consulate in st. petersburg. the scope of russia’s retaliation grew clearer on friday as the kremlin summoned 23 ambassadors from other countries to evict some of their diplomats. on saturday  the tass news agency reported that moscow had informed britain it must send home a total of “more than 50” diplomats. russia had already announced the expulsion of 23 britons. mr. trump has remained publicly silent amid the dramatic rounds of diplomatic retaliation  leaving it to others to condemn moscow. frustrated by the investigation of the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii  into whether his campaign cooperated with russia in 2016  a scenario he dismissed as a “hoax ” mr. trump recently called mr. putin to congratulate him on his victory in a re-election widely dismissed as a sham.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mr. trump made no mention of the poisoning of mr. skripal during the call but instead suggested that he wanted to schedule a summit meeting with the russian president. both countries still have ambassadors in place  so high-level contact on potentially calamitous matters should continue  as it did at the height of the cuban missile crisis. but the wheels of basic diplomacy  involving visas  consular services  cultural events and simply talking to people  are grinding ever more slowly and  in some cases  coming to a halt. “the parties lose some of their eyes and ears  so the quality of the reporting goes down ” said charles a. kupchan  who was the europe director of the national security council under president barack obama. “it’s not just intelligence but day-to-day political and economic reporting: what’s the buzz in the street  what do interlocutors say? and consular services do get hit.” the expulsions left many diplomats wondering how the american embassy in moscow could operate. much of the burden will fall on the ambassador  jon m. huntsman jr.  who took over an embassy already struggling to function after an order by the kremlin last summer that it dispense with 755 employees in response to sweeping american sanctions for russia’s election meddling. “the embassy is struggling to do basic operations. this latest round will hurt ” said michael a. mcfaul  who served as ambassador in moscow from 2012 to 2014. “morale  of course  is also very low.” even before this week’s expulsions  the wait in moscow to obtain a visitor’s visa to the united states was among the longest in the world. it now takes 250 days just to get an appointment with the visa section  compared with four in beijing and 31 in new delhi. advertisement an american spokesman told russian news media this week that the embassy had been placed under “significant constraints” by the foreign ministry and “could not accommodate all their many requests at all times  particularly for large groups.” simon schuchat  a former diplomat at the embassy in the moscow  recalled how haphazard and unnerving it was when russia began the process of ousting alleged spies during a round of expulsions in 2001. inevitably  moscow ordered out diplomats unconnected to espionage. “they tended to go for people with better language skills ” mr. schuchat said  adding that they “missed many spies and included many non-spies.” this time around  intelligence officers working under “official cover” as diplomats were especially targeted  but some american officials played down the impact  saying the united states still came out ahead in the expulsions. “that’s to our benefit ” dan coats  the director of national intelligence  said at a seminar on thursday in austin  tex. “there are a lot more russians in america than americans in russia in the intelligence agencies.” on friday  russia’s foreign ministry accused the agencies overseen by mr. coats of exploiting the situation by approaching russian diplomats leaving the united states to offer “assistance” in exchange for “entering into covert relations” on behalf of the american government. “the ploy is not working ” the ministry said in a statement  “but their behavior is cynical and distasteful  as if washington has stepped completely beyond the bounds of common decency.” peter baker reported from washington  andrew higgins from moscow  and steven erlanger from brussels.

politics,advertisement by ben protess and steve edermarch 8  2018  travelers trying to book a stay at the trump international hotel & tower panama on thursday found no rooms available on trumphotels.com. but the website for the bahia grand panama had several luxurious options  at the very same oceanfront hotel. the dueling websites — and their conflicting occupancy information — are the latest twist in the oft-bizarre battle between president trump’s family business and the majority owner of the panama city property  who has spent months trying to oust the trumps as both the managers and the branders of the hotel. on monday  the majority owner  orestes fintiklis  declared victory and a worker pried the silver t-r-u-m-p name from the property  even as the trump organization described the move as legally improper and disputed that it had permanently lost control. advertisement by thursday  a statement was released that said the hotel had a new name  bahia grand panama; a new website; and even new social media accounts. the statement  sent from “public relations ” declared  “as of today  the former trump international hotel & tower panama is no longer managed by or affiliated with trump brand.” advertisement don’t tell that to the trumps  who continue to make their case in various legal venues. in a statement  the trump organization’s chief legal officer  alan garten  noted that the management contract “mandates that all disputes be resolved through binding arbitration” and that “trump hotels has filed a $50 million lawsuit against mr. fintiklis.” with a hammer and a crowbar  the trump name was pried off a panama city hotel amid a contentious dispute between the trump organization and the hotel's majority owner. mr. fintiklis’s actions on thursday  mr. garten said  “constitute an abuse of process and represent another attempt by him to misuse the panamanian courts in an effort to circumvent arbitration.” “we look forward to litigating this matter in the forum agreed upon by the parties where we are confident we will prevail ” mr. garten said. amid the legal wrangling  the trump organization’s website and social media for the property continued to exist  with no sign of the struggle. but when a reporter tried to book a room  the trump website — replete with information on accommodations  dining options and the health club — responded as if the hotel was filled: “we apologize. there are no available rooms for your requested stay. please check your dates and try again.” over at thebahiagrand.com  a message greeted guests: “welcome to the bahia grand panama  the only luxury hotel directly on the open waters of the majestic gulf of panama city — with one exciting change — we’re under new management.” even though the name was not unveiled until thursday  the hotel owners seemed to have had it picked out for more than a month. the new website was registered on jan. 30  according to records from the cyberforensics company domaintools. advertisement the bare-bones website does not detail where guests can eat or drink on the property. but one thing is clear: the “book now” tab shows availability. in fact  the fight between the trumps and mr. fintiklis has centered on the hotel’s occupancy rates. mr. fintiklis has claimed that profit has plummeted as the hotel sat “virtually empty.” the trump organization disputes that claim and argues that the hotel “continues to outperform the market by a wide margin” as the broader panamanian hotel business has struggled.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the dispute exploded last month when mr. fintiklis appeared at the hotel with an entourage and sought to fire several trump-employed staff members. the trump employees stood their ground. then  on monday  mr. fintiklis arrived with a contingent of court officials and police officers — and a panamanian court order authorizing a change of administration. he declared victory. the trumps pushed back. the panamanian court order  the trumps argued  merely authorized “the appointment of a temporary  third party administrator to oversee the management of the property while the underlying dispute is being litigated.” that nuance did not prevent mr. fintiklis  a cypriot citizen  from heading to the baby grand piano in the lobby to play and sing “accordeon ” a popular greek song about the fight against fascism. the piano is not featured on either website. we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement by maria abi-habib  kai schultz and suhasini rajfeb. 22  2018  new delhi — donald trump jr.  who has spent the week in india pitching new luxury high-rises that bear his family’s name  took the stage before a crowd of about 200 on thursday. “building a better mumbai ” the banner behind him proclaimed. “we’re actually delivering true luxury ” mr. trump told the guests  who were greeted by a red carpet  lit candles and a jazz band. “we’re actually delivering buildings in the indian marketplace that you can take out of that marketplace  put in any cosmopolitan of the world and say  ‘this is on par with some of the best.’” the trump organization is reaping the windfall from india’s admiration for president trump. he may have low approval ratings at home  but he appears well liked in a country with one of the fastest-growing populations of millionaires in the world. the trump brand “spells glamour more than luxury ” said kalyani chawla  a brand consultant and former executive at christian dior in india who attended the event. “i think it’s all about donald trump  honestly ” she said  “any idea of donald trump in general  regardless of the fact that even he’s surprised he’s the president of the united states.” advertisement but even before the president’s son arrived in india to press the flesh and do the deals  his trip was creating controversy over its potential for blurring the lines between the trump white house and the trump organization. advertisement as mr. trump hopped from city to city  senator robert menendez  democrat of new jersey  sought assurances from the united states embassy in delhi that it was not helping mr. trump. and ethics experts seemed unable to overstate the incongruity of a sitting president’s son drumming up business overseas. “nothing like this — no  never ” said marilyn l. glynn  who served as general counsel at the office of government ethics during parts of the clinton and bush administrations. “unprecedented  unheard-of.” the controversy only grew as word spread that mr. trump planned to give a speech in new delhi on friday  taking the podium before prime minister narendra modi speaks. the topic: “reshaping indo-pacific ties: the new era of cooperation.” “the title sure sounds like something you would hear from a diplomat ” said joshua white  who worked in the obama white house as director for south asian affairs at the national security council. “it is not illegal  but it would muddy the waters and i think make life rather difficult for those in the united states government who are being measured about how they articulate what the administration’s indo-pacific strategy is and will become.” on wednesday  mr. menendez said in a letter to the embassy in new delhi  “given the potential to confuse mr. trump’s private business visit with having an official governmental purpose  i write to ensure that the u.s. embassy presence in india will have no role in supporting mr. trump or the trump organization during his time in india  other than that necessary to provide any security support for the u.s. secret service.” the embassy said it had no role in the visit other than helping with his security. in his comments on the stage in mumbai on thursday  mr. trump defended his actions  and said his father’s job had actually been bad for business. “we don’t want any kind of conflict of interest ” he said. “we don’t want anyone to say that we’re taking advantage. from a business perspective  it’s clearly a negative. there will be a time after politics where we will be able to get back into that market.” advertisement after the talk was done  many in the audience excitedly rushed the stage to shake his hand before he disappeared. if india loves the president’s son  he appears to love it back. “i think there is something about the spirit of the indian people that is unique here to other parts of the emerging world ” mr. trump said in a local television interview earlier in the week. he said  “i don’t want to be glib but you can see the poorest of the poor and there is still a smile on a face.” “i know some of the most successful people in the world and some of them are the most miserable people in the world ” he added.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a

the city  meeting with dozens of buyers in the tower overlooking the arabian sea. after paying 80 million indian rupees  or $1.2 million  for a three-bedroom apartment  sumeet arora  one of the buyers  expected the developer to be prompt for the meeting. instead  they waited for an hour and a half for mr. trump to show up. when he finally arrived at noon  mr. trump gave the well-heeled audience members a sales pitch on the virtues of the building  even though they had already collectively pledged millions of dollars on the units  which are to open by june 2019. “they’ve got some units left — they wanted us to suggest people as leads ” mr. arora said. under the trump administration  new delhi is enjoying some of the warmest relations it has ever had with washington. for indian officials  part of the appeal is the hard line the administration has taken on pakistan  india’s chief rival. but for many other indians  it is simply that the trump family name seems to them to be synonymous with success. in new delhi over the weekend  several of the country’s leading newspapers carried full front-page ads with the younger mr. trump’s face  arms crossed over his chest with the question: “trump is here. are you invited?” the ad promised a meeting with the president’s son if prospective buyers put down a booking fee of about $38 000 for a trump organization project in gurgaon  just south of new delhi. advertisement the promise of a meeting with the younger mr. trump was apparently enough to spur sales  said kalpesh mehta of tribeca developers  the trump organization’s partner for the gurgaon project. mr. mehta told local reporters that on monday alone  when mr. trump touched down in new delhi to kick off his weeklong tour  the company recorded sales of $15 million. ground has yet to be broken on the two trump towers in gurgaon — the completion date is in 2023 — but sales have topped $100 million  mr. mehta said. mumbai is the financial center of the country and has one of the largest concentrations of billionaires in the world. it also has some of its biggest slums. in the city  formerly known as bombay  construction cranes and half-finished buildings dot the skyline. new towers compete with old ones  as buildings go ever higher to maximize space and provide better views of the arabian sea and the city below. “bombay all of a sudden has gone vertical ” said mr. arora  whose current home in a 10-story building in mumbai’s juhu neighborhood has slowly been dwarfed by taller buildings. ms. chawla  the brand consultant who attended the candlelit reception  said she admired the trump properties she has seen abroad. but there is a world of difference between admiring and owning. “i wish i could afford it ” she said. “i feel really inadequate sometimes when i come to these things.” maria abi-habib reported from new delhi  and kai schultz and suhasini raj from mumbai. vindu goel contributed reporting from new delhi  and eric lipton from

politics,advertisement by michael s. schmidt and maggie habermanmarch 15  2018  washington — the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii  has subpoenaed the trump organization in recent weeks to turn over documents  including some related to russia  according to two people briefed on the matter. the order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to president trump’s businesses  bringing the investigation closer to the president. the breadth of the subpoena was not clear  nor was it clear why mr. mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company  an umbrella organization that encompasses mr. trump’s business ventures. mr. mueller ordered the trump organization to hand over records related to russia and other topics he is investigating  the people said. the subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation  which mr. trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now  will continue for at least several more months. word of the subpoena came as mr. mueller appears to be broadening his inquiry to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding mr. trump’s political activities. in recent weeks  mr. mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses  including an adviser to the united arab emirates  about the flow of emirati money into the united states. mr. mueller has already indicted 13 russians and three companies accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign  and on thursday  the trump administration included them in sanctions it leveled at moscow as punishment for interference in the campaign and “malicious cyberattacks.” advertisement the trump organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into russian election interference  and there was no indication the company planned to fight mr. mueller’s order. advertisement “since july 2017  we have advised the public that the trump organization is fully cooperative with all investigations  including the special counsel  and is responding to their requests ” said alan s. futerfas  a lawyer representing the trump organization. “this is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.” the white house press secretary  sarah huckabee sanders  reiterated during her daily briefing that the president was cooperating with the special counsel inquiry and referred further questions to the trump organization. there are few other publicly known examples of mr. mueller using subpoenas. in january  he ordered the president’s former chief strategist  stephen k. bannon  to appear before a grand jury. mr. mueller dropped the subpoena after mr. bannon agreed to be interviewed by investigators. mr. mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to mr. trump’s business outside ties to russia  mr. trump said in an interview with the new york times in july that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with russia. the president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line. what you need to know to start your day  delivered to your inbox monday through friday. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. mr. trump campaigned as a businessman whose deal-making prowess would translate directly into reforming washington. the argument helped propel him to the white house  but the trump organization has been a magnet for criticism from democrats  ethics watchdogs and some republicans  who expressed concern that he remained vulnerable to conflicts of interest because he did not separate from the company. before mr. trump was sworn in  he pledged that he would stay uninvolved in his businesses while in office but insisted it would be too punitive for his business partners for him to divest from the company altogether. among the trump organization’s holdings are golf clubs  hotels and licensing agreements for the use of the trump name on properties and other products. while its holdings are complex  the company has always been run like a small  family-owned business; mr. trump brought in his three eldest children to help run the enterprise. advertisement the trump organization is not publicly held  making it difficult to determine where it receives its money and invests it. the company has said that it never had real estate holdings in russia  but witnesses recently interviewed by mr. mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in moscow. in 2015  a longtime business associate of mr. trump’s  felix sater  emailed mr. trump’s lawyer  michael cohen  at his trump organization account claiming he had ties to president vladimir v. putin of russia and that building a trump tower in moscow would help mr. trump’s presidential campaign. mr. trump signed a nonbinding letter of intent for the project in 2015 and discussed it at least three times with mr. cohen. a revealing comment about russia by eric trump  the president’s middle son  also drew scrutiny when it emerged last year. james dodson  a longtime golf writer from north carolina  said offhand in a radio interview that eric trump  who oversees the golf courses for the trump organization  told him in 2013 that the trumps relied on russian investors to back their golf clubs. eric trump has denied those remarks. mr. mueller was appointed in may to investigate whether mr. trump’s campaign colluded with the russians to influence the 2016 election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry. a month later  the white house counsel  donald f. mcgahn ii  threatened to quit after mr. trump asked him to have mr. mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation. mr. mueller is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation. mr. trump’s lawyers are in negotiations with mr. mueller’s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. mr. mueller’s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president  according to two people familiar with the talks. the lawyers have advised mr. trump to refuse an interview  but the president has said he wants to do it  as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions. at the same time  mr. trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel’s investigation. last week  mr. trump spoke with emmet t. flood  a longtime washington lawyer who represented former president bill clinton during the impeachment process  about coming into the white house to deal with the inquiry. michael s. schmidt reported from washington  and maggie haberman from new york. mike mcintire contributed reporting from new york. get politics and washington news updates via facebook  twitter and the morning briefing newsletter. a version of this article appears in print on march 16  2018  on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline: mueller demands trump’s company surrender files.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. see more » go to home page » 
politics,advertisement by maria abi-habib and eric liptonfeb. 17  2018  gurgaon  india — when the trump family jet lands in india this week  the family member taking a tour of the world’s largest democracy — with a secret service detail in tow — won’t be the president on a diplomatic mission. it will be his eldest son  donald trump jr.  on a sales trip. but indians might be forgiven for not making much of the distinction. the visit by the younger mr. trump  intended to help sell more than $1 billion in luxury residential units being built by the trumps and their local partners  has been promoted with newspaper advertisements that read: “trump has arrived. have you?” the younger mr. trump’s weeklong itinerary of cocktail parties  dinners and events with real estate brokers  business leaders and prospective buyers comes as president trump is working to strengthen ties between the two countries. the president  who enjoys widespread popularity in india  was greeted by prime minister narendra modi with a bear hug in washington last june  and the two leaders have frequently discussed greater military cooperation and ramping up trade. mr. trump has also taken a harder line toward pakistan and china  two of india’s rivals. two weeks ago  president trump phoned mr. modi pledging “to strengthen security and economic cooperation” between india and the united states. the overlap in india between father and son creates a spectacle with few parallels in business and diplomacy. advertisement the younger mr. trump is scheduled to arrive on monday on a boeing 757 nicknamed trump force one  because the president crisscrossed the united states on the plane during the campaign. advertisement the trump family earned as much as $3 million in royalties in 2016 from ventures in india  according to the president’s financial disclosure report. and ivanka trump made her own trip to india in november  in her capacity as a member of trump administration  just as sales were about to start on some of the residential projects. “the idea that the president’s son would be going and shilling the president’s brand at same time donald trump is president and is managing strategic and foreign relations with india — that is just bizarre ” said daniel s. markey  who helped coordinate south asia policy at the state department during the george w. bush administration. there are no formal federal rules that prohibit the younger mr. trump from pursuing his business interests; he is a private citizen. and even though president trump is still a beneficial owner of the family business  he is not subject to conflict of interest laws  as the president is exempt. the white house  asked if donald trump jr.’s trip gave even an appearance of a conflict of interest  declined to comment on the matter. india is the trump organization’s biggest international market  with four real estate projects underway. the largest is here in gurgaon  a fast-growing city outside new delhi with a litany of fortune 500 companies and a skyline filled with skyscrapers. the trump development encompasses two towers with a total of 254 “ultra luxury” units  according to the company  each selling for up to $1.5 million. the luxury apartment buildings near the trump development in gurgaon have names like palm springs and central park  even as they overlook pothole-ridden highways. the trumps and their partners are offering buyers the opportunity to become “members of the trump family ” with the promise of exclusive amenities such as an infinity swimming pool  a billiards room and valet services. the marketing materials  however  don’t mention the president — his name and image  as well as that of his daughter ivanka  who joined his administration  were removed from brochures  websites and billboards from projects in india and elsewhere in the world. still  confusion among indians is evident. “i had no idea that trump built property around the world before this development was launched ” said hitesh khanna  who is helping sell units at the trump towers in gurgaon through a local real estate brokerage firm. “i just thought he was president.” mr. khanna’s boss  rajiv bansal  predicted the presidential connection would create enough buzz to entice buyers. mr. khanna was working out of a roadside tent near the construction site  with a tattered emerald green felt carpet at its entrance. advertisement “everyone in india knows who the u.s. president is ” mr. bansal said. “it’s a status symbol. this is a big brand  the president of the united states’ name will be on it.” donald trump jr.  in an interview in new york last week  said that he had spent nearly a decade “cultivating relationships in india” and that the company was “now seeing the response of that effort.” to that point  the newspaper advertisements in india featured large photographs of him  arms crossed and staring into the camera. the younger mr. trump said his itinerary did not include interactions with government officials in an intentional effort to steer clear of politics. “we certainly won’t get involved in that ” he said  when asked if the company would seek concessions or incentives for the developments from indian officials. “not at all.” he is scheduled  nonetheless  to speak at the global business summit in new delhi  sponsored by a prominent indian newspaper and a bank  who say the event will “showcase india’s rise in world affairs.” mr. trump is billed as a keynote speaker  along with prime minister modi. other stops on the 3 000-mile journey include kolkata  where construction on a project with 137 luxury units is about to begin; mumbai  where a 78-story trump-branded tower with 400 residences is scheduled to be completed next year; and pune  a city near mumbai  where a fourth trump-branded project has been built. the trumps’ partner in pune is panchshil realty  which was co-founded and is run by two brothers  atul chordia and sagar chordia  who are active in the opposition nationalist congress party and who have a longstanding relationship with the head of the party  sharad pawar. the trump organization has not put up capital for its indian projects  instead relying on indian-based partners whose investors include morgan stanley and a singapore investment fund. the trump organization gets a cut of the sales  with payments increasing if the units sell above market rates. advertisement so far  according to business partners in india  many units are selling about 30 percent per square foot higher than market rates. the younger mr. trump’s visit this week is expected to reinforce that trend  they said  even as many other luxury housing towers have hundreds of empty units. in addition to an oversupply  a recent indian government crackdown on the so-called black money economy has hurt sales at competing developments  but the trump name remains a draw. “the brand is a lead generator ” said kalpesh mehta  who runs the mumbai-based development company tribeca  which serves as the lead representative for the trump brand in india. “it is what is making people pay attention and look at it deeply.” buyers who put down a deposit this week  according to an advertisement wrapped around the front page of the hindustan times this weekend  are promised a seat at a dinner with the younger mr. trump. madhav das nalapat  an academic and prominent newspaper columnist who is close to senior members of india’s ruling bharatiya janata party  said the excitement around the trump towers was an extension of the country’s complicated caste system and the trump administration’s tough stance on its rival pakistan. “india is a hierarchical society ” he said. “trump is now leading the no. 1 country in the world  so his brand has higher value. that counts. it’s not who he is. it’s what he is.” under voluntary ethics rules governing the trump organization’s activities during the trump presidency  international projects in the works before the 2016 election — which include all of the india properties now being marketed — can proceed as planned. president trump handed over daily operations of the company to his sons donald jr. and eric  but he remains the owner. still  some ethics lawyers say the mere presence of the trump organization in india is problematic. “the question isn’t just whether don trump jr. is making phone calls to say  ‘give me a favor ’” said zephyr teachout  a fordham university law professor who is part of a lawsuit claiming that president trump’s business ties violate the emoluments clause of the constitution. “it is by having these business entanglements  does it create incentives and opportunities for people in the indian government to try to use the business relations to impact american policy.” the trump family’s financial interests in india could also call into question the president’s objectivity in dealing with the country  ms. teachout said. advertisement “it looks bad  it smells bad  and it leaves an uncertainty in the faith of the american public about the diplomatic choices that the trump administration makes regarding india ” she said. arun kumar singh  a former ambassador to the united states from india  and mr. markey  the former state department official who is now a professor at johns hopkins university’s school of advanced international studies  said they had not seen changes in united states policy toward india that they would attribute to president trump’s business interests. the biggest difference from the obama administration  they said  was the apparent warmth between president trump and prime minister modi. “i have always had a deep admiration for your country and for its people  and a profound appreciation for your rich culture  heritage and traditions ” president trump said in june during a state visit by prime minister modi  one of many such words of praise for india he has offered in the last year. maria abi-habib reported from gurgaon  india  and eric lipton from new york. suhasini raj contributed reporting from gurgaon  and mark landler from washington. a version of this article appears in print on february 18  2018  on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline: profits  not diplomacy  draw a trump to india.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement by michael d. shear and maggie habermanmarch 26  2018  washington — after 61 weeks in the white house  president trump has found two people he won’t attack on twitter: stormy daniels and karen mcdougal. the verbose commander in chief has posted more than 2 900 times on twitter since taking office  using the term “fake news” to describe everything from the russia inquiry and allegations of chaos in the white house to harassment accusations  the size of his inaugural crowds and heated arguments with world leaders. but he has been uncharacteristically silent in recent days — to the relief of his advisers — as a pornographic film star and a playboy model described intimate details of sexual encounters with mr. trump. stephanie clifford  known in pornographic films as stormy daniels  said sunday night on cbs’s “60 minutes” that she once spanked the president with a copy of forbes magazine bearing his face on the cover. the fact that the president has not given oxygen to the headlines  however  does not mean that he is content. advertisement inside the white house  mr. trump is eager to defend himself against allegations that he insists are false  those close to him say. and he is growing increasingly frustrated with breathless  wall-to-wall news media coverage of the salacious details from the two women. advertisement on monday  ms. clifford’s lawyer added new charges to the suit she filed: that the president’s lawyer defamed ms. clifford in denying her claims; that he and mr. trump pursued the deal to specifically help mr. trump’s election prospects; and that he then structured the agreement to shield from public view what was  effectively  an illegal $130 000 campaign gift. in discussions with allies and some aides  mr. trump has privately railed against ms. clifford  and insisted that she is not telling the truth. he has reminded advisers that he joined an effort to enforce financial penalties against ms. clifford  whose tv interview on sunday night was hyped throughout the weekend on the cable news channels that mr. trump watches obsessively. but there has been no debate among mr. trump’s advisers about the best course for him: just keep quiet about a story that would only be fueled by a presidential tweet or a comment about the women shouted above the roar of marine one. keeping a lid on mr. trump is never easy  especially when he is eager to hit back at his adversaries. in the days after an “access hollywood” video exposed his own lewd comments about women during the final month of the campaign  mr. trump responded by showing up at his debate with hillary clinton with three women who had accused bill clinton of sexual improprieties. what you need to know to start your day  delivered to your inbox

as a candidate  and as president  mr. trump has eagerly attacked just about all of his enemies and accusers  often with colorful nicknames like “little rocket man” for the north korean leader  “crazy joe biden” or “sloppy steve” bannon. but for now  it appears that the president is listening to — and accepting — his advisers’ warnings on the dangers of speaking out about the women  much the way he followed the advice of his lawyers for a year not to attack robert s. mueller iii  the special counsel in the russia inquiry. advertisement recently  he has ditched that advice  attacking mr. mueller and his team directly on twitter. that leaves only his alleged mistresses and president vladimir v. putin of russia as people who are immune to mr. trump’s twitter trash-talk. raj shah  a deputy white house press secretary  declined to say “what the president may or may not have seen” on television sunday night  though he said that mr. trump denies the allegations that ms. clifford made in the cbs interview. “i’ll just say that he’s consistently denied these allegations ” mr. shah said. “the president doesn’t believe that any of the claims that ms. daniels made last night in the interview are accurate.” mr. trump dined at his mar-a-lago estate in florida on saturday evening with michael d. cohen  his lawyer and longtime aide who is at the center of the clifford scandal  according to three people familiar with the get-together. the president scheduled the meeting himself  surprising his aides with it a short time before mr. cohen arrived  people familiar with the meeting said. melania trump  too  has been silent about the allegations. asked to react to the interviews  stephanie grisham  mrs. trump’s spokeswoman  said: “she’s focusing on being a mother  she’s quite enjoying her spring break and she’s focused on future projects.” it is not clear whether mr. trump watched a similar tell-all interview on cnn on thursday evening  when karen mcdougal  a former playboy model  alleged a 10-month romantic affair with mr. trump in which they repeatedly had sex. sunday’s interview with ms. clifford contained few surprises but some humiliating details  such as ms. clifford saying she was not attracted to mr. trump  and her recollection of spanking him. virility and strength are key traits that the president likes to project  and he once gloated about a new york post headline quoting a friend of his second wife  marla maples  who recalled ms. maples saying that mr. trump was the “best sex i’ve ever had.” in the interview  ms. clifford said that she had flirted with mr. trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in lake tahoe. she said mr. trump had compared her favorably to his daughter during the flirtation  and that she had intercourse with mr. trump. advertisement she also alleged that an unknown person whom she believed to be connected to mr. trump and mr. cohen threatened her in a parking lot in 2011  telling her  “leave trump alone. forget the story.” then looking at her infant daughter  he added  “that’s a beautiful little girl. it would be a shame if something happened to her mom.” asked by anderson cooper whether she had anything to say to mr. trump  if he was watching sunday night  ms. clifford said  “he knows i’m telling the truth.” even that has not prompted mr. trump to directly address the central allegations from ms. clifford and ms. mcdougal — that the president cheated on his wife shortly after mrs. trump gave birth to their son. mr. trump did type out a vague “fake news” tweet on monday morning  although it is unclear to what he was referring.              so much fake news. never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. but through it all  our country is doing great!         beyond the details of the alleged encounters  mr. trump’s advisers have been urging the president to keep quiet about the legal wrangling concerning ms. clifford and ms. mcdougal. ms. mcdougal  who accepted $150 000 from the parent company of the national enquirer to keep quiet about her alleged affair with mr. trump  is suing the company to be released from the contract. mr. cohen has acknowledged paying ms. clifford $130 000 in the days before the 2016 election to keep quiet about her allegations. mr. shah said at the white house on monday that “i can say categorically that  obviously  the white house didn’t engage in any wrongdoing.” asked about why mr. trump’s lawyer would pay ms. clifford $130 000 if her allegations were false  mr. shah said that “false charges are settled out of court all the time.” he referred further questions about the case to mr. cohen. advertisement the lawyer for ms. clifford has aggressively argued that his client is not bound by the nondisclosure agreement that she signed  in part because mr. trump himself never signed the document. michael avenatti  the lawyer  has repeatedly used trumplike insinuations to suggest that ms. clifford has digital evidence of the intercourse. “we have a litany of more evidence in this case  and it’s going to be disclosed  and it’s going to be laid bare for the american public ” mr. avenatti said in an interview monday morning on abc’s “good morning america.” last week  mr. avenatti tweeted a picture of a cd or dvd with the suggestive caption: “if a picture is worth a thousand words  how many words is this worth???? #60minutes #pleasedenyit #basta.” even that has not prompted a presidential retort — yet. an earlier version of this article misstated the title of raj shah. he is a deputy white house press secretary  not the white house press secretary. jim rutenberg contributed reporting from new york. get politics and washington news updates via facebook  twitter and the morning briefing newsletter. a version of this

politics,advertisement by michael s. schmidt and maggie habermanmarch 17  2018  washington — a lawyer for president trump called on the justice department on saturday to end the special counsel investigation into ties between russia and the trump campaign  shifting abruptly to a more adversarial stance as the inquiry appeared to be intensifying. the comments by the lawyer  john dowd  were prompted by the firing late on friday of the former deputy f.b.i. director andrew g. mccabe. mr. dowd exhorted rod j. rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  who oversees the special counsel  to end the inquiry and accused the former f.b.i. director james b. comey of concocting a baseless investigation. “i pray that acting attorney general rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the f.b.i. office of professional responsibility and attorney general jeff sessions and bring an end to alleged russia collusion investigation manufactured by mccabe’s boss james comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier ” mr. dowd told  the daily beast. his remarks capped another round of revelations in recent days that reinvigorated or displayed mr. trump’s frustrations with the investigation  which has cast a shadow over his presidency. he was said to be angered over a new york times report that records from the trump organization were subpoenaed  and he celebrated the firing of mr. mccabe  who was among the first f.b.i. officials to scrutinize possible links between russia and the trump team  calling his dismissal a “great day for democracy”  on twitter. advertisement on saturday evening  mr. trump for the first time posted a tweet that specifically mentioned the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii. the president again denounced the inquiry he is conducting as a “witch hunt.” advertisement “the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime ” he wrote. “it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc  and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign.” mr. dowd  by contrast  did not name the special counsel in his statement  but the implication that he believed mr. mueller should be fired was unmistakable. such a move could set off alarms among republicans in congress  who have largely stood by as the president repeatedly assailed the justice department and the f.b.i. mr. dowd said at first that he was speaking on behalf of the president but later backed off that assertion. he did not elaborate on why he was calling for the end of the investigation  saying only: “just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations.” people close to the president were skeptical that mr. dowd was acting on his own. mr. trump has a history of using advisers to publicly test a message  giving him some distance from it. and mr. dowd’s comments came at a time when members of mr. trump’s legal team are jockeying to stay in his favor. hours later  the president echoed mr. dowd’s accusations of corruption in the theoretical “deep state” that mr. trump has long cast as a boogeyman working to undermine him. “there was tremendous leaking  lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi  justice & state ” he wrote on twitter.              as the house intelligence committee has concluded  there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign. as many are now finding out  however  there was tremendous leaking  lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi  justice & state. #draintheswamp  the president’s tweets  posted on a saturday in which he remained inside the white house with no public schedule  came as mr. mueller is said to have sent questions to mr. trump’s legal team as part of negotiations over an interview with the president. mr. mueller is seeking the interview  according to two people close to the white house  in order to ask follow-up questions  but put forward the list as a start. advertisement mr. dowd’s remarks about mr. mueller’s investigation represented an extraordinary shift in public strategy for the trump legal team. since taking over the case last summer  mr. trump’s lawyers have urged a strategy of restraint  in which the president avoids discussing mr. mueller or criticizing him  and the lawyers had done nothing publicly until now that could agitate the special counsel’s team. the comments by both mr. trump and mr. dowd lent credence to mr. mccabe’s assertion that the president sees his firing as directly tied into mr. mueller’s case. mr. mccabe  who is a potential witness in the investigation  declared that his dismissal was an attempt to undermine it. mr. sessions fired mr. mccabe for failing to be forthcoming with the department’s internal watchdog about a conversation he authorized between f.b.i. officials and a journalist. like mr. comey  mr. mccabe also kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president and his conversations with mr. comey  a person close to mr. mccabe said on saturday.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. the memos could support the account of mr. comey  who described in his memos and congressional testimony repeated requests from the president to clear his name. mr. comey said mr. trump also asked him to end an investigation into his former national security adviser  michael t. flynn. the special counsel is investigating both matters. mr. mccabe’s memos were left at the f.b.i.  which means that mr. mueller’s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate mr. comey’s account. mr. mccabe’s lawyers had no comment on saturday  and mr. rosenstein has repeatedly defended the special counsel  including in an interview this month with usa today  in which he said he had seen no need to fire mr. mueller. mr. comey  who has a book scheduled to be published next month  weighed in himself. “mr. president  the american people will hear my story very soon ” he tweeted. “and they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.” the president’s supporters have tried to undercut the investigation as part of a broader attempt to clear him of wrongdoing. this month  republicans on the house intelligence committee — which is led by a close ally of the president  representative devin nunes of california — concluded their own investigation into russia’s election meddling  saying they had determined the president did nothing wrong. democrats on the panel accused republicans of putting partisan politics ahead of fact finding. advertisement mr. trump  who has repeatedly criticized mr. mccabe’s wife for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee tied to terry mcauliffe  a hillary clinton ally  for a virginia state senate race  praised mr. mccabe’s ouster again on saturday. “the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught  called out and fired. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by crooked h friend  terry m  who was also under investigation?” he tweeted. “how many lies? how many leaks? comey knew it all  and much more!” mr. trump has increasingly expressed frustration as the special counsel investigation has shown more signs of accelerating rather than ending. his legal team has worked to keep him from firing mr. mueller in the past. to keep the president at bay  the lawyers — led by the white house lawyer ty cobb — told him that mr. mueller’s investigation would be over by last december and that they would ask mr. mueller to put out a statement saying the president was not a target of the investigation. but instead  mr. trump was livid anew this week over the times report that mr. mueller had subpoenaed his corporate records  including those related to russia  according to one person close to the white house. the president’s lawyers appear to be feeling increasingly uneasy about where they stand. this month  mr. trump met with a veteran washington lawyer  emmet t. flood  to discuss coming on board to take over the president’s dealings with mr. mueller’s office and possibly replacing donald f. mcgahn ii as white house counsel. the president’s personal lawyers  mr. dowd and jay sekulow  did not know about the meeting  prompting concerns that they could be pushed aside  and potentially making them less resistant to mr. trump’s whims about handling the inquiry. last june  mr. trump backed down from his demand that mr. mueller be fired after mr. mcgahn threatened to quit. a month later  mr. trump said in an interview with the times that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with russia. after the trump organization subpoena was revealed on thursday  mr. trump’s lawyers privately tried to play it down  in part to keep the president and his family calm. mr. dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing episodes in recent months. in december  he said he had written a tweet posted by the president that implied mr. trump knew that mr. flynn had lied to the f.b.i. when mr. trump fired him. months earlier  mr. dowd was overheard by a times reporter discussing details of a dispute inside the president’s legal team over lunch at a washington steakhouse. democrats seized on mr. dowd’s statement on saturday. senator mark warner of virginia  the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee  called on lawmakers of both parties to defend mr. mueller. michael s. schmidt reported from washington  and maggie haberman from new york. matt apuzzo contributed reporting

politics,advertisement by peter baker and maggie habermanjan. 3  2018  washington — president trump excommunicated his onetime chief strategist  stephen k. bannon  from his circle on wednesday  ending for now a partnership of convenience that transformed american politics while raising questions about the future of the nationalist-populist movement they cultivated together. the rupture came after mr. bannon was quoted in a new book disparaging the president’s children  asserting that donald trump jr. had been “treasonous” in meeting with russians and calling ivanka trump “dumb as a brick.” mr. trump  described by his spokeswoman as “furious  disgusted ” fired back by saying that mr. bannon had “lost his mind.” in a written statement  the president excoriated mr. bannon as a self-promoting exaggerator who had “very little to do with our historic victory” in the 2016 presidential election and was “only in it for himself.” rather than representing mr. trump’s hard-core political base or supporting his agenda to “make america great again ” mr. bannon was “simply seeking to burn it all down ” the president said. while mr. trump had remained in touch with mr. bannon after pushing him out of the white house over the summer  the two now appear to have reached a breaking point. “steve bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency ” mr. trump said. “when he was fired  he not only lost his job  he lost his mind.” advertisement assuming it lasts — and with mr. trump  nothing is ever certain — the schism could test whether he or mr. bannon has more resonance with the conservative base that has sustained the president through a tumultuous tenure marked by low poll numbers. mr. bannon’s breitbart news has been a key weapon in mr. trump’s hostile takeover of the republican party. advertisement cheering the breakup on wednesday were establishment republicans who resent mr. bannon’s bomb-throwing style and his vows to wage war on incumbent lawmakers in the party primaries this year. senate republicans could barely contain their glee as they redistributed mr. trump’s statement blasting mr. bannon with the note “in case you missed it” and a smiling face symbol. by afternoon  candidates whom mr. bannon has endorsed in a handful of races faced pressure to disavow his remarks about the president’s son. at the white house on wednesday morning  aides who had kept a watchful eye on mr. bannon’s efforts to make himself a kingmaker saw an opening to finally rid themselves of him. they encouraged the president to hit back publicly  and mr. trump went through at least three drafts of a statement with his communications director  hope hicks  and other aides before sending out a final version unlike any issued by a president against a top adviser in modern times. “steve pretends to be at war with the media  which he calls the opposition party  yet he spent his time at the white house leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was ” mr. trump said in the statement. “it is the only thing he does well. steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue  whom he helped write phony books.” a private lawyer representing mr. trump sent mr. bannon a letter on wednesday directing him to cease and desist making derogatory comments about the president and his family and threatening a defamation lawsuit. “legal action is imminent ” said the letter  first reported by abc news and confirmed by a person close to the president. mr. bannon declined to comment on wednesday. but people close to him said that he believed that the president would eventually come around because mr. trump would need help with his base at a moment when his political muscle appeared to be on the wane. mr. bannon’s breitbart site reported the contretemps but did not return fire against mr. trump on wednesday. the president was responding to comments attributed to mr. bannon in a new book  “fire and fury: inside the trump white house ” by michael wolff. the book  due out next tuesday  was obtained by the guardian  which first reported mr. bannon’s remarks  and new york magazine then posted an excerpt. a copy of the book was later obtained by the new york times. in the book  mr. bannon was quoted suggesting that donald trump jr.; jared kushner  his brother-in-law; and paul manafort  then the campaign chairman  had been “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” for meeting with russians after being promised incriminating information on hillary clinton during a june 2016 meeting at trump tower in manhattan. advertisement “the three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside trump tower in the conference room on the 25th floor — with no lawyers. they didn’t have any lawyers ” mr. bannon said after the times revealed the meeting in july 2017  according to mr. wolff’s book. “even if you thought that this was not treasonous  or unpatriotic  or bad shit  and i happen to think it’s all of that  you should have called the f.b.i. immediately ” mr. bannon continued  according to the book. he also said that the chance that donald trump jr. did not introduce the russians to his father “is zero ” a supposition rather than an assertion but one that would contradict the president’s insistence that he knew nothing about the meeting at the time. according to mr. wolff  mr. bannon also predicted that a special counsel investigation into russia’s interference in the 2016 election and any coordination with trump aides would ultimately center on money laundering  an assessment that could lend credibility to an investigation the president has repeatedly called a witch hunt. “they’re going to crack don jr. like an egg on national tv ” mr. bannon was quoted as saying.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. donald trump jr. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. but he jabbed at mr. bannon on twitter on wednesday when he reposted a message noting that alabama now had a democratic senator. “thanks steve ” the younger mr. trump wrote. “keep up the great work.” the president and his advisers blamed mr. bannon for backing roy s. moore for the republican nomination in alabama and then pressing mr. trump into endorsing mr. moore even after he was accused of sexual misconduct with several women and girls as young as 14. mr. moore ended up losing last month  embarrassing mr. trump and souring his already complicated and strained relationship with mr. bannon. mr. trump grew more upset about an interview mr. bannon gave to vanity fair that criticized mr. kushner’s contacts with russians. during his christmas break in florida  mr. trump stewed and consulted with aides and relatives  according to advisers  but ultimately opted against responding publicly to avoid drawing more attention to mr. bannon’s remarks. but accusing the president’s eldest son of treason crossed the line. “going after the president’s son in an absolutely outrageous and unprecedented way is probably not the best way to curry favor with anybody ” said sarah huckabee sanders  the white house press secretary. the book presents mr. trump as an ill-informed and thoroughly unserious candidate and president  engaged mainly in satisfying his own ego and presiding over a dysfunctional white house. it reports that early in the 2016 campaign  one aide  sam nunberg  was sent to explain the constitution to the candidate. “i got as far as the fourth amendment ” it quotes mr. nunberg as saying  “before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.” advertisement the book cites an email from an unnamed white house aide offering a harsh assessment of mr. trump’s operation that was said to reflect the view of gary d. cohn  the president’s national economics adviser: “it’s worse than you can imagine. an idiot surrounded by clowns. trump won’t read anything — not one-page memos  not the brief policy papers; nothing. he gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored.” the book also asserts that mr. cohn and other advisers and associates of mr. trump deride him in private  calling him an “idiot ” a “dope” or “dumb” as dirt. thomas j. barrack  a friend and adviser to mr. trump  was quoted telling a friend that the president is “not only crazy  he’s stupid.” reached by telephone on wednesday  mr. barrack said that account was “totally false.” mr. barrack added  “it’s clear to anyone who knows me that those aren’t my words and inconsistent with anything i’ve ever said.” he said that mr. wolff never ran that quotation by him to ask whether it was accurate. a longtime media columnist and author  mr. wolff brings a high profile  vivid writing style and years of experience but sometimes mixed reviews to the task of chronicling mr. trump’s white house. interview subjects have complained in the past that he took comments meant to be off the record and used them. in a 2004 profile  the journalist michelle cottle wrote that “the scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created — springing from wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events.” mr. wolff clearly benefited from close cooperation from mr. bannon and the book is infused with his views. the author was frequently seen in mr. bannon’s office while he was still working in the white house. according to ms. sanders  mr. wolff spoke with the president just once  for five to seven minutes  in the first month of the administration  when mr. trump called mr. wolff to thank him for his criticism of a times article that the president did not like. going beyond the president’s pushback on mr. bannon  ms. sanders attacked the book as a whole  hoping to discredit its reporting. ms. sanders released a statement calling it “trashy tabloid fiction” that is “filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the white house.” mr. wolff  responding by email  said he was “wholly comfortable with my numerous sources.” peter baker reported from washington  and maggie haberman from new york. reporting was contributed by eileen sullivan  michael tackett and emily cochrane from washington  amy chozick from new york and jeremy w. peters from detroit. follow eileen sullivan  peter baker and maggie haberman on twitter: @esullivannyt @peterbakernyt @maggienyt a version of this article appears in print on january 4  2018  on page a1 of the new york edition with the headline: ‘furious’ trump snaps at bannon over his ridicule.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement supported by letters to the editor:  “mr. trump’s empty words on trade” (editorial  march 12) asserts that president trump’s announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports “should worry everyone concerned about a trade war or the health of the steel and aluminum industries.” yes  we all understand the “free trade” orthodoxy that a country benefits from having no tariffs even if its trading partner imposes tariffs on imports into its own country. but it is equally true that both countries benefit even more if neither country imposes tariffs. economic theory does not teach how to persuade your trading partner to lower or eliminate its own tariffs. that is the art of diplomacy and negotiation  and president trump  to his credit  appears to recognize that trade policy is one of the tools in his chest to achieve desired ends in trade and other international relations. after decades of ballooning united states trade deficits under a free trade regime  maybe we should give the president a chance to experiment with his fair trade policy before questioning its — and his — wisdom. kurt m. heymanwilmington  del. to the editor: alexander hamilton was a believer in tariffs  but if he were president trump’s treasury secretary  he would have resigned in disgust. hamilton argued that the only way the fledgling united states economy could ever hope to compete with the more advanced british economy was to place tariffs to protect “infant industries” in the united states. however  he was quite clear to add that when the protected industries “matured ” the tariffs should be removed to place competitive pressure on the american industries (to keep prices down). tariffs protect inefficient domestic industries  and retaliatory tariffs by those countries hurt by our tariffs are levied on our most efficient industries — those industries able to compete on international markets. the effect then of mr. trump’s tariffs is to subsidize inefficiency and to penalize efficiency. where does that get the united states economy in the long run? john kirk  redwood city  calif. the writer is a retired professor of economics. to the editor: what if instead of imposing tariffs on specific goods we imposed … let’s call them “sanctions” for the sake of this argument? these sanctions would not allow into the united states  at least not without penalty  specified goods that had been produced under conditions that would be illegal in the united states. factors such as working conditions  wages and pollution could all be criteria. tariffs tend to benefit few. these rules could benefit many. their adoption could greatly benefit workers in the united states by not giving a competitive advantage to foreign companies that underpay workers  and could benefit workers abroad by promoting safer conditions and living wages. the sanctions could also provide the teeth needed to enforce pollution standards on the world stage. sarah palcher  pasadena  calif. advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by letters to the editor: frank bruni argues that president trump’s reluctance to attack stormy daniels is an extraordinary  if not unique  aberration for a man who so readily denigrates  bullies  insults and threatens others (“the calm before the stormy ” column  march 21). rather  as mr. bruni observes  he is the “tempered pacifist ” perhaps fearful of what will be publicly revealed. more blatant and infinitely more consequential is his treatment of vladimir putin. as reported in “president’s call to putin dodges talk of foul play” (front page  march 21)  mr. trump made a congratulatory call to mr. putin for his lopsided and undemocratic victory while withholding any criticism of russia for its interference in our political process  its cyberattacks or its alleged role in the poisoning of a former russian spy in england. we have a right  and a responsibility  to question mr. trump’s motivation. mr. trump’s treatment of mr. putin serves no clear political purpose and  in fact  runs counter to all the advice he has been given by his advisers. a logical speculation — and one can only speculate — is that just as the president may be fearful of what stormy daniels may reveal  he fears the same with mr. putin. for this reason  congress should take a clear and proactive step to ensure that the mueller investigation is not undermined. larry s. sandberg  new york advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by stephen moore if you can  put aside for a moment your opinion of donald trump’s words and actions and let’s be perfectly honest: one year into his presidency  could the economy be any rosier? the economy grew at a rate of about 3 percent in the last three quarters  something that economists said was very unlikely just a year ago. the more than 40 percent increase in the dow jones industrial average since election day means a nearly $7 trillion jump in wealth. that has benefited the rich  yes  but every one of the 55 million americans with a 401(k) plan  the 20 million with iras and the millions more with public and private pension plans have benefited  too. i would argue that investors are turning lower business tax rates on profits and the administration’s rollback of regulations into higher stock valuations. the job market improved impressively under barack obama’s presidency after the great recession  when millions of jobs vanished seemingly overnight. but the past year’s continued decline in joblessness is impressive as well. in recent weeks  the number of new unemployment insurance claims and the unemployment rate for blacks and hispanics have been at or near their lowest levels in more than four decades. then there is the cheerful news for the rust belt areas of the country: blue-collar manufacturing  construction and mining jobs have risen by almost half a million in just one year. all of this is punctuated by the daily news of more jobs  higher pay and fresh investment in america just one month into the trump tax cut. apple’s plan to bring some $250 billion in profits back to america  create 20 000 jobs  open a new business campus and pay $38 billion in taxes to the treasury department is just the kind of response we hoped for from lowering corporate and repatriation taxes. fiat chrysler has announced it is moving an auto factory to michigan with 2 500 jobs. after decades of outsourcing jobs from america  companies are creating jobs here. in recent days  we have seen similar announcements of worker bonuses or new hiring from disney  home depot  jpmorgan chase  fedex and other companies. a new quinnipiac poll finds that two-thirds of american voters now rate the economy as good or great  the highest number since the question was first asked 17 years ago. admittedly  these are short-term trends  based on just one year of mr. trump’s term. if i’ve learned anything as an economic analyst  it is that the stock market and economic winds can shift by the hour. but for now  it’s hard to see many dark clouds on the horizon. they will come  of course  as they do for almost every president. but few presidents can claim to have presided over the kind of economy the united states is enjoying now. and surely the primal screams from both the right and left that president trump would ruin the economy now seem hysterical. so who gets the credit for this surge? most voters say president obama — and  sure  he gets some because corporate balance sheets were healthy when mr. trump entered office. but there are several holes in this theory. for one  the economy was decelerating at the end of the obama presidency  with the annual growth rate falling to an anemic 1.6 percent in 2016  and many economists warned of a recession. if mr. trump had continued mr. obama’s policies  one might not credit him for today’s strong economy. but mr. trump has begun to systematically overturn obama policies on taxes  regulations  energy  climate change  net neutrality  budget priorities and health care — as well as replacing janet yellen as chairwoman of the federal reserve. trumponomics is obamanomics in reverse. in the first 18 months of the reagan presidency  the economy plummeted and the president’s liberal critics triumphantly declared reaganomics a failure. but by late 1982  with reagan’s phased-in tax cuts finally kicking in  the economy exploded and quarterly growth rates hit 8 percent  job creation soared and reagan won re-election in a 49-state landslide. if the economy had nose-dived in 2017  there’s no doubt the media would have pounced on trump policies as disgraceful failures. but with the economy red-hot  he gets little credit. that’s a double standard. ultimately  the most important statistical indicator for mr. trump will be wages for middle-income workers. they’ve been flat in real terms for 15 years  which more than anything explains the populist rebellion in 2016. so far  wages and salaries haven’t bumped up much  but we are betting that the tax cut will bring increased investment and a supertight job market with intense competition for workers leading to higher pay. this is already starting to happen at walmart and other companies  and in fast-growing cities like nashville and san francisco. if those wages go up  mr. trump may not get credit from the news media or democrats  but it’s a good bet he will get re-elected. stephen moore  a senior fellow at the heritage foundation  was a senior economic adviser to the trump campaign. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by richard c. paddockmarch 2  2018  pattaya  thailand — it has all the makings of a pulp novel  though the ending is still a mystery. a high-end escort from belarus  who says she was the mistress of a powerful russian oligarch  flees to thailand. but at a seaside resort known for its raunchy entertainment scene  she gets arrested for helping to conduct a sex workshop. hoping to avoid deportation  she offers information about president trump and russia. but her appeal is for naught. no one has stepped forward to grant her asylum. such has been the saga this week of anastasia vashukevich  who also goes by the name nastya rybka. the 21-year-old model and blogger was arrested sunday in the thai holiday town of pattaya along with nine others involved in the sex training course  which was aimed at male russian tourists. “she will be deported ” said the chief of thailand’s immigration bureau  suttipong wongpin  in an interview thursday. “her immigration offense is working without a work permit.” advertisement in events that have played out publicly on instagram and youtube for months  ms. vashukevich has revealed what she says was her close association with the aluminum tycoon oleg v. deripaska and his friendship with russia’s powerful deputy prime minister  sergei e. prikhodko. advertisement mr. deripaska has business ties to paul manafort  mr. trump’s former campaign chairman  who is under investigation by robert s. mueller iii  the special counsel looking into the campaign’s connections to russia. financial records show that companies controlled by mr. manafort owed millions of dollars to mr. deripaska  a billionaire with close ties to russia’s president  vladimir v. putin. during the 2016 presidential campaign  mr. manafort offered to give mr. deripaska private briefings. ms. vashukevich  in a video that she apparently recorded in the back of a thai police truck after her arrest  said she could provide evidence of russian interference in the 2016 united states presidential election. she claims to have detailed information about connections between russian officials  mr. manafort and mr. trump — if only someone could get her out of thai detention. her assertion of inside knowledge might be easily dismissed but for a 25-minute video investigation posted last month on youtube by the russian opposition figure aleksei a. navalny  which relies heavily on videos and photos from ms. vashukevich. in particular  it includes video footage from 2016 of mr. deripaska sailing on his yacht with mr. prikhodko and a description of their meeting in a book by ms. vashukevich. mr. navalny asserted that the yacht trip was a bribe from mr. deripaska to mr. prikhodko and said that ms. vashukevich was one of “several” prostitutes aboard the vessel. in one part of the video  the two men can be heard discussing russian-american relations. advertisement the video has had more than 6.2 million views despite efforts in russia to block it. mr. deripaska said through a spokesman that mr. navalny’s allegations of bribery and prostitutes were a “hot story that appears far from being the truth.”  please verify

vashukevich’s deportation from thailand  her associate alexander kirillov  also known as alex lesley  distributed a letter addressed to “usa consul” seeking political asylum for all 10 of the arrested sex workshop trainers. mr. kirillov  who was alleged to be running the sex seminar  was in immigration detention after being arrested. the letter claims that their lives are at risk and reiterates the offer of inside information about communications between the oligarch  the deputy prime minister and people in the united states. “help us and protect us as quickly as possible because we have very important information for usa ” the letter says. a spokeswoman for the american embassy in bangkok declined to comment. mr. suttipong  a police lieutenant general  said that ms. vashukevich remained in detention. he said that her visa was revoked after she was found to be working in pattaya  about 80 miles south of bangkok. five others arrested in connection with their roles in the sex training will also be deported  he said  and the other four will remain in thailand  where they may face criminal charges. videos of the workshop posted by the organizers showed dozens of men  and a few women  sitting in rows of chairs in a hotel meeting room while listening to lectures in russian. hotel staff called the police when they heard suspicious noises coming from the room  according to local media reports. at one point  ms. vashukevich posted a photo of herself in what appears to be a jail cell. in an instagram post on wednesday afternoon  she said she was being taken to the main immigration detention center in bangkok. advertisement “we’re being transported to another prison again ” she wrote. “to bangkok. they don’t explained why.” ryn jirenuwat contributed reporting from bangkok  and

politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributors by thomas r. pickering and james stoutenberg in september 1796  george washington  weary of partisan combat just eight years after the ratification of the constitution and the founding of the nation  wrote a farewell address explaining why he would not seek a third term. his message is worth remembering in our current political moment. in elaborate and thoughtful prose  washington raised red flags about disunity  false patriotism  special interests  extreme partisanship  fake news  the national debt  foreign alliances and foreign hatreds. with uncanny foresight  he warned that the most serious threat to our democracy might come from disunity within the country rather than interference from outside. and he foresaw the possibility of foreign influence over our political system and the rise of a president whose ego and avarice would transcend the national interest  raising the threat of despotism. washington certainly had great confidence  but in his address he didn’t brag about his accomplishments. on the contrary  he beseeched the almighty to soften the impact of his errors and expressed hopes that the country would forgive them. he established a standard for presidential self-deprecation out of the fear that a president of grossly inflated ego could become a threat to democracy. he cautioned against both overly friendly alliances (lest another country’s interests and wars become our own) and excessive hatreds (lest we provoke unnecessary conflict and war with others). forbearance in the use of power was another of his major themes. “a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration  to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres  avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another ” he declared. such encroachment  he said  would lead to the consolidation of power and create “a real despotism.” some of washington’s most prescient warnings were about the dangers of factionalism. he wrote that should one group  “sharpened by the spirit of revenge ” gain domination over another  the result could be “a more formal and permanent despotism.” the despot’s rise would be fueled by “disorders and miseries” that would gradually push citizens “to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual.” “sooner or later ” he concluded  “the chief of some prevailing faction  more able and more fortunate than his competitors  turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.” as if envisioning the political tribalism and 24/7 cable news culture of today  he urged political leaders to restrain “the continual mischiefs” of political parties. the “spirit of party ” he wrote  “serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. it agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms  kindles the animosity of one part against another  foments occasionally riot and insurrection.” and then he arrived at one of his greatest concerns: the ways in which hyperpartisanship could open the door “to foreign influence and corruption  which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.” on friday  robert mueller  the special counsel  charged 13 russians with trying to help donald trump win the 2016 election. one need only read the indictment to understand what the first president was talking about. since 1893  a senator has read the farewell address on the floor of the senate every year on washington’s birthday  alternating annually by political party. bluntly speaking  it’s become little more than an exercise in bipartisan lip service. the house of representatives stopped reading it decades ago. this was  at least  a form of honesty. clearly no one was listening anymore. in 2016  fake news  gerrymandering  voter suppression and disenfranchisement were “the mischiefs” employed by the republican party to propel mr. trump’s campaign. and mr. trump  perhaps “more able and more fortunate than his competitors ” stumbled to victory using mendacious appeals to voters squeezed by a greedy economy — even though mr. trump had himself profited handsomely from that economy. if only we had heeded washington’s warnings  would the election have turned out as it did? washington’s goal was to ensure that the young country became stable enough to withstand the threats to liberty and freedom he saw on the horizon — a horizon that has now stretched 220 years into the future. we can never say he didn’t warn us. thomas r. pickering is a former under secretary for political affairs and ambassador to russia  israel and the united nations. james stoutenberg  a former brooklyn assistant district attorney  is a business consultant. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter. advertisement    collapse see my options

politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributors by cameron smith and norman l. eisen wednesday gave us a spectacle never before seen in the 228-year history of relations between american presidents and their attorneys general. president trump publicly attacked jeff sessions  his attorney general  as “disgraceful” for refusing to unleash his prosecutors on mr. trump’s political enemies — seemingly suggesting that the attorney general should quit (and not very subtly at that). mr. sessions  equally publicly  stood his ground. he fired back that he was acting with “integrity and honor ” and emphasized that “law and the constitution” are his guideposts. one of us is a former sessions aide; the other a frequent sessions critic. but we agree that the attorney general was right to take a stand  and that he is to be applauded for doing so. what is at stake in this dispute is nothing less than american rule of law. for that reason  mr. sessions should stay right where he is to defend it  including rejecting mr. trump’s apparent effort to force his resignation. to understand the enormous stakes here  some context is necessary. president trump was once a fan of the attorney general — that is  until mr. sessions had the nerve to recuse himself from the russia investigation last year. doing so was the right call legally. mr. sessions had served as chairman of the trump campaign’s national security advisory committee  and applicable ethics rules require campaign officials to recuse themselves from investigations of their campaigns. we now know that mr. sessions did the right thing in the face of intense pressure from the president  who had ordered don mcgahn  the white house counsel  to lobby mr. sessions not to recuse himself. when mr. sessions did so anyway  president trump fumed and asked  “where’s my roy cohn?” mr. sessions’s recusal left the deputy attorney general  rod rosenstein  free to appoint robert mueller as special counsel to oversee the russia investigation. when president trump learned of the appointment  he reportedly unloaded on mr. sessions  calling him an “idiot.” the attorney general told the president he would resign and later delivered a resignation letter to the white house  though the president apparently returned it with the note “not accepted” at the top. since then the president’s temper has periodically erupted at mr. sessions publicly and privately  with one report saying mr. trump was hoping mr. sessions might be embarrassed into resigning. wednesday’s apparent renewal of that effort was the most startling episode yet. it began when mr. sessions suggested that the inspector general for the department of justice would handle allegations advanced in a memorandum  endorsed by the republican majority on the house intelligence committee  that the department had improperly obtained surveillance warrants for a former trump campaign aide. such a referral is a normal move for allegations of misconduct  and one that mr. sessions’s predecessors from both parties have frequently taken. but it infuriated president trump  who tweeted  “why is a.g. jeff sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive fisa abuse. will take forever  has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on comey etc. isn’t the i.g. an obama guy? why not use justice department lawyers? disgraceful!” mr. sessions offered this dignified response: “as long as i am the attorney general  i will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor  and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and constitution.” mr. trump may be renewing his effort to push mr. sessions out  but this time  mr. sessions is not handing in a resignation letter. lest there be any doubt about that  mr. sessions very publicly dined wednesday night with mr. rosenstein and the solicitor general  noel francisco. they are the second and third in the line of succession at the department  respectively  should mr. trump fire mr. sessions. the dinner sent the message that the attorney general’s colleagues support him. this is no mere personnel flap. the principle that the president is attacking — and that mr. sessions and his colleagues are standing up for — is central to the administration of justice in america. it is that the awesome powers wielded by the attorney general and those who work for him should never be deployed for political purposes. those powers can deprive defendants of their liberty  their property  even their lives. merely investigating someone can be crushing. that should only be done when demanded by justice — not the whim of a president. it is a solomonic solution by mr. sessions to refer mr. trump’s allegations for initial screening to a neutral fact-finder. contrary to mr. trump’s tweeted suggestion  that is precisely the role of the justice department’s inspector general. it is critical to the rule of law that mr. sessions stay right where he is. we are heartened that he refused to budge  and we hope he will continue to do so. he has satisfied honor by submitting his resignation once before. he need not do it again. let mr. trump fire him if he dares. the good news is  the president probably won’t. first  the russia investigation continues to hang over the president. firing mr. sessions would be perceived as an effort to replace him with an attorney general who is not conflicted out of the investigation and capable of taking control of it for mr. trump. doing so would create a firestorm  and keep the investigation in the news longer. then there is the question of legal liability for the president. a sessions firing might  like the termination of james comey  the former f.b.i. director  be viewed by mr. mueller as possible obstruction of justice. that is especially true if the special counsel is  as has been reported  already investigating the president’s july attempt to oust mr. sessions. firing mr. sessions would also jeopardize the president’s relationship with senate republicans. senators jeff flake  bob corker and john mccain have already publicly broken ranks with the president on various matters. there are others  like senators charles grassley and lindsey graham  whose loyalty to mr. sessions  their former colleague  likely runs deeper than their allegiance to the president. he is counting on senate republicans to serve as a firewall against the russia investigation and much more. a sessions firing would most likely breach it. finally  there would be agonizing choices to be made when it comes to selecting a replacement. if mr. sessions is fired  president trump will have a hard time finding someone with the integrity required to earn senate confirmation and the proven personal loyalty he demands. and therein lies the problem. at the end of the day  jeff sessions is no roy cohn. he is a man of integrity who may serve at the pleasure of the president  but this week he demonstrated his fealty to the rule of law and the constitution. we urge him to stay in his job and continue to defend the department of justice — and our nation — against continued attempts to politicize federal law enforcement. cameron smith  the general counsel and vice president for the r street institute  served as counsel to jeff sessions on the senate judiciary committee. norman l. eisen is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and the chairman of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter. advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement by mark mazzettimarch 28  2018  washington — a top trump campaign official had repeated communications during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential race with a business associate tied to russian intelligence  according to a document released on tuesday by the special counsel investigating russian interference in the election. the campaign official  rick gates  had frequent phone calls in september and october 2016 with a person the f.b.i. believes had active links to russian spy services at the time  the document said. mr. gates also told an associate the person “was a former russian intelligence officer with the g.r.u. ” the russian military intelligence agency. the special counsel  robert s. mueller iii  is investigating numerous contacts between president trump’s advisers and russia-linked individuals and entities leading up to and after the november 2016 election. the document  filed in mr. mueller’s name  stated that the communications between mr. gates and the individual were “pertinent to the investigation.” the individual is identified only as “person a ” and the document describes him as someone who worked for mr. gates and paul manafort  mr. trump’s campaign chairman  as part of their earlier representation of russia-aligned parties and politicians in ukraine  including the former president of ukraine. a person with knowledge of the matter identified person a as konstantin v. kilimnik  who for years was mr. manafort’s right-hand man in ukraine. mr. manafort has told associates that he does not believe that mr. kilimnik has ties to russian intelligence  but the document released on tuesday shows that mr. gates told others of his history in the intelligence services. that history was widely discussed for years among people who worked with mr. manafort and mr. gates in ukraine. advertisement at the time of the calls  mr. gates was the trump campaign’s liaison to the republican national committee and  before that  he was the campaign’s deputy chairman. mr. manafort served as the campaign chairman until august 2016  when he resigned amid the growing controversy about his work in ukraine. advertisement both mr. manafort and mr. gates were indicted last year for money laundering and other financial crimes committed while  the charges said  they tried to hide the money they received for their ukraine work. last month  mr. gates pleaded guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators and has agreed to cooperate with mr. mueller’s investigation. mr. manafort has vowed to fight the charges. in february 2017  he told the new york times he had “never knowingly spoken to russian intelligence officers  and i have never been involved with anything to do with the russian government of the putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.” what you need to know to start your day  delivered to your inbox monday through friday. please verify you're not a robot by

say  ‘i’m a russian intelligence officer.’ ” mr. kilimnik was born in ukraine when it was still part of the soviet union  and he served in the russian army as a linguist. last year  as scrutiny mounted of his work with mr. manafort and mr. gates in ukraine  he steadfastly denied any association with russian intelligence. an investigation by ukrainian prosecutors into mr. kilimnik’s possible links to russian spy agencies was closed late last year without charges. mr. kilimnik has maintained residences in moscow and kiev  the capital of ukraine  and has traveled regularly between them during years of working for mr. manafort and mr. gates on behalf of various russia-aligned oligarchs and political parties. the new document is a sentencing memorandum for alex van der zwaan  a lawyer who pleaded guilty in february to lying to federal investigators about his conversations with mr. gates in 2016 about work the two men did in ukraine. mr. van der zwaan was an attorney at a firm that worked with mr. manafort and mr. gates to prepare a report used to defend viktor f. yanukovych  the former ukrainian president  from international criticism over the prosecution and incarceration of one of his political rivals. advertisement mr. van der zwaan “worked closely” on the report with mr. gates and person a  according to a court filing submitted tuesday night by mr. van der zwaan’s lawyers asking the judge for leniency in sentencing. mr. van der zwaan originally told mr. mueller’s investigators that he had not spoken to mr. gates since august 2016  but subsequently admitted he had lied after prosecutors confronted him with evidence of conversations. the sentencing document describes an observation by one unidentified witness in the investigation who said mr. van der zwaan had “gone native.” “that is  he had grown too close to manafort  gates  and person a ” the document stated. according to the filing by his lawyers  mr. van der zwaan “had explored opportunities to leave skadden to work directly for gates and manafort” in 2012 and 2013. kenneth p. vogel and sharon lafraniere contributed reporting. get politics and washington news updates via facebook  twitter

politics,advertisement supported by editorial by the editorial board seeing someone stand up to a bully is cathartic. that feeling is magnified when the bully is the president of the united states and his abusive behavior cries out for a response from honorable people. the problem is that a vast majority of the people in the best position to put weight behind such a response  republicans in congress  have kept silent. so it’s understandable that many americans delighted in the rare  remarkably aggressive display of anger directed at president trump over the weekend by some of his favorite targets — the nation’s formerly highest-ranking law enforcement and intelligence officials — following mr. trump’s predictable gloating over the late-friday-night firing of andrew mccabe  the former deputy director of the f.b.i. mr. mccabe accused the president of waging an “ongoing war on the f.b.i.” and said his firing showed what happens when “people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.” james comey  whom mr. trump fired as f.b.i. director last may and continued to attack ever since  tweeted  in reference to his forthcoming book  that americans would soon be able to “judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.” and john brennan  who ran the c.i.a. under president barack obama  simply unloaded on mr. trump: “when the full extent of your venality  moral turpitude  and political corruption becomes known  you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.” declarations like these may be important to make and gratifying to read  but they really shouldn’t be coming from those whose integrity depends on them remaining outside the political fray  even in these insane times. for starters  they make it easier for mr. trump and his defenders to argue  as they already do  that crucial witnesses in the investigation by the special counsel  robert mueller  into the trump campaign’s possible ties to russia are biased against the president. mr. mccabe acknowledged this dynamic in an interview with the times  describing his dismissal as “part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.” he’s right. but now that he has taken the bait and defended himself publicly — however understandable that is — he has fed that dynamic. it’s not that mr. trump is more credible than these men; to the contrary  it’s hard to think of an american public figure right now with less credibility than the president  who boasted last week about lying to the canadian prime minister. it’s that this is exactly how mr. trump likes it: he drags people down to his level  forcing them to choose between retaliation and silence. their decision wouldn’t be so hard if the g.o.p. leadership in congress were not  as usual  morally absent. cynical as ever  mitch mcconnell  the senate majority leader  has said nothing in the face of the president’s degrading tweets and renewed attacks on the mueller investigation. the house speaker  paul ryan  sent a spokeswoman out to issue a milquetoast defense of the special counsel. by keeping mum as mr. trump marauds across american democracy  they are forcing the targets of his attacks to defend themselves and also abetting mr. trump’s assault on the credibility of the f.b.i. and the justice department. a handful of republicans have spoken up — the usual suspects  like senator jeff flake  who called the firing of mr. mueller “a massive red line that can’t be crossed ” and senator lindsey graham  who repeated his warning to mr. trump that it would be “the beginning of the end of his presidency.” on sunday  representative trey gowdy  who knows a thing or two about long-running investigations  scolded mr. trump’s lawyer john dowd for urging the shutdown of mr. mueller’s investigation. “if you have an innocent client  mr. dowd  act like it ” mr. gowdy said. republicans should be pushing back on mr. trump now in part to keep him from firing mr. mueller  a move that could strain our institutions past their breaking point. even better  they should pass legislation protecting mr. mueller from being fired without good cause. the need for such a law grows more urgent daily. in his weekend twitter outburst  mr. trump for the first time targeted mr. mueller by name  and on monday  the times reported  he added to his legal team a lawyer who has argued on television that f.b.i. and justice department officials framed the president. meanwhile  mr. comey  mr. mccabe and the others who face mr. trump’s taunts and provocations should remember the old warning about wrestling a pig. you only get covered in mud — and  besides  the pig likes it. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by op-ed contributor by clint watts mr. watts testified on march 30  2017  at a senate select committee on intelligence hearing and presented a statement  “disinformation: a primer in russian active measures and influence campaigns.” last week  in a sentencing memorandum for the lawyer alex van der zwaan  the special counsel’s office noted that rick gates and “person a” — an unnamed figure who has ties to a “russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016” — “were directly communicating in september and october 2016.” what coverage there was of this staggering claim — evidence of a direct link between a member of donald trump’s campaign and russian intelligence — and the van der zwaan filing was quickly overtaken by controversy over the president’s relationship with an adult film star. it’s been a year since i testified to the senate select intelligence committee on russian interference in the presidential election of 2016. the revelations from robert mueller’s indictments since then have provided so much clarity on how russia interfered in our democracy — yet americans seem more confused about the question of possible collusion with russia. that is  in a way  by design — russia’s design. its infiltration and influence on america is difficult to understand  even with vastly more detail about russia’s influence efforts. a lot of the focus on the mueller investigation has fallen on donald trump: did he obstruct the investigation? was he a “manchurian candidate” or just a russian ally  by ideology or business interests? in my view  as a former f.b.i. special agent who has watched the kremlin’s infiltration of america since 2014  the answer may be neither. a standard russian approach would have been to influence mr. trump through surrogates like mr. gates and paul manafort rather than through direct command through an individual — in this case  the candidate and then president. russian intelligence develops options and pathways over many years; as objectives arise — like the election of mr. trump — they focus and engage all available touch points. the revelation last week about mr. gates’s connection is another piece of evidence to support that view. russia’s efforts to influence  known by the kremlin moniker active measures  did not seek a single pathway into the trump team. instead  they targeted a wide spectrum of influential americans to subtly nudge their preferred policy into the mainstream and sideline foreign opponents. russian intelligence services establish campaign objectives and compromise foreign targets through espionage  but their principal focus is to recruit agents of influence. typically  the kremlin deploys layers of surrogates and proxies offering business inducements  information or threatened reprisals that can individually be explained away by coincidence while masking the strings and guiding hands of the kremlin’s puppet masters and their objectives. when called upon by the kremlin  oligarchs  contractors  criminals and spies (current or former) all provide levers for advancing president vladimir putin’s assault on democracies. in trump and his campaign  mr. putin spotted a golden opportunity — an easily ingratiated celebrity motivated by fame and fortune  a foreign policy novice surrounded by unscreened opportunists open to manipulation and unaware of russia’s long run game of subversion. mr. putin has succeeded where his soviet forefathers failed by leveraging money and cyberspace to subtly infiltrate and influence americans while maintaining plausible deniability of their efforts. and the kremlin’s ground game “cut outs” — intermediaries who facilitate communication between agents — conducted a more complex game. each mueller indictment and investigative lead illuminates more kremlin influence avenues into president trump’s inner circle. mr. van der zwaan  whose father-in-law is the russian oligarch german khan  lied to investigators about his conversations with mr. gates  the trump deputy campaign manager  and a person a  whom the f.b.i. assessed as a russian intelligence agent and many believe to be konstantin kilimnik  an associate of both mr. gates and mr. manafort  a trump campaign manager. evidence of russia’s intent to interfere in the election is overwhelming  and documentation of trump campaign members’ collusion not only exists but is growing. the special counsel’s investigation into collusion ultimately comes down to two questions. first  did president trump or any member of his campaign willingly coordinate their actions with russia? and did president trump or any member of his campaign knowingly coordinate their action with russia? trump campaign members certainly colluded with russian influence efforts  some willingly  some possibly knowingly. the president denies the kremlin’s hand  either still unaware or in denial of being manipulated by mr. putin’s minions. for mr. putin  it’s likely everything he hoped for — america riddled with political infighting and mired in investigations  a weakened nato alliance vulnerable to aggression and a united states president seeking his adoration  obstinate and ignorant of the great caper the kremlin just orchestrated. the problem for the president is that ignorance is not immunity. the problem for america is that ignorance of russian interference is vulnerability. clint watts (@selectedwisdom) is the robert a. fox fellow at the foreign policy research institute  a former f.b.i. special agent and author of the forthcoming book “messing with the enemy: surviving in a social media world of hackers  terrorists  russians and fake news.” follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options 
politics,advertisement supported by by maureen dowd washington — this was the week donald trump became president. or at least the week he became the president we were always expecting. he ceased bothering to pretend that he was ever going to do the job in any normal sense of the word. he decided to totally own the whole  entire joke that he is. he started hiring people right off tv. he extended his tiny fingers into his giant flat screen  “purple rose of cairo”-style  and dragged cable conservatives directly into the administration. we’ve always known trump makes stuff up. but now he has stopped bothering to pretend that he doesn’t. truthful hyperbole is out. outlandish fabrication is in. trump began bragging to republicans at a private fund-raiser in st. louis wednesday: oh  get a load of this trade stuff i made up to outfox that fox  justin trudeau. i felt bad doing it to such a nice  good-looking guy. but it’s hilarious! he is no longer bothering to pretend that governing involves a learning curve. now he finds it’s clever to be a fabulist  concocting phony facts about the trade deficit when talking to the canadian prime minister — one of our closest allies — or inventing a story for donors about how japanese officials test american cars by dropping a bowling ball on their hoods from 20 feet up to see which ones dent. the president thinks he’s navigating to his true north while the rest of the world thinks he’s headed due south. trump & friends presented this dizzying white house purge as a twisted version of him growing into the job  even as everyone else felt he was going in the opposite direction  behaving disgracefully by 86-ing rex tillerson in a tweet and tormenting other staffers he finds annoying or uppity. the daily beast reported that tillerson learned his fate from john kelly while on the toilet  which is apropos because bill maher likes to say trump does his morning business while doing his morning business. (h. r. mcmaster is probably afraid to hit the bathroom now.) trump got his next moment of gross exaltation when jeff sessions  frantically trying to save his own job  fired andrew mccabe hours before he became eligible for his government pension and on his birthday weekend. john brennan  the former director of the cia  tweeted that trump will take his “rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.” then the president’s lawyer  john dowd  issued a statement saturday saying he will “pray” that rod rosenstein “will follow the brilliant and courageous example” of sessions and end the russia investigation entirely. trump is giddy about all the chaos — he capitalized it on twitter — feeling that he’s ridding himself of any idiots who called him a moron or dumb as a rock and any economists who don’t understand what a great dealmaker he is. except the one thing his presidency has definitively proven is that he doesn’t have the foggiest idea how to prepare for a negotiation  let alone negotiate. as though omarosa filling a top white house job between reality shows was not weird enough  the times’s michael grynbaum described a “hall-of-mirrors moment” on wednesday: larry kudlow  a chatterer plucked from cnbc to replace gary cohn as trump’s chief economic adviser  went on tv to describe the president telling kudlow how “very handsome” he looks on tv. “so trumpian!” kudlow laughed. it’s the final foxification of politics. trump spends all his time watching fox news  basing his opinions and tweets on it  and now he’s simply becoming one with it. he is even willing to overlook his distaste for the yeti mustache of the warmongering john bolton and consider the fox news analyst as a replacement for mcmaster. roger ailes would be so proud  if he were still alive and harassing women. trump thinks he’s a fabulously devious manager creating “great energy ” with great ratings coming from his talent for theatrical twists and turns. but he’s really inhumane  playing people against one another and widely discussing successors for officials who haven’t even been officially informed that they’re walking the plank. and  far from the a-team he promised  he’s hired a bunch of pathetic  disgusting swamp schnorrers who can’t stop using taxpayer money to fund their office furniture or office redesign or luxury plane trips with their wives. “i like conflict ” trump said this month at a press conference with the swedish prime minister  smacking his fists together and adding  “i like watching it  i like seeing it  and i think it’s the best way to go.” never mind that a lot of the country — and the world — craves stability. while the president may appear unconstrained  intoxicated with escaping the net of those who displease him by telling him “no ” he is getting ever more enmeshed in another net — robert mueller’s. “i think trump is royally pissed about the mueller subpoena of the trump organization records ” trump biographer michael d’antonio says about the special counsel crossing the president’s red line. “he fears the nakedness of his true business activities being revealed far more than the shame of ‘access hollywood’ or stormy daniels. unlike the show of blank paper in file folders conducted when he supposedly stepped away from his businesses  this will require real documents  and i doubt he can count on people lying for him.” if you’ve ever had a narcissistic boss  you know that they hate to hear any criticism and love to whack the naysayers and replace them with more compliant types. the circle of sycophants  who do not care about the boss  often spurs the leader’s flameout. president trump is doing it his way now. but soon  he’ll be doing it mueller’s way. i invite you to follow me on twitter (@maureendowd) and join me on facebook. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.    opinionchris hayes advertisement    collapse see my options

politics,advertisement by matthew rosenbergmarch 21  2018  john brennan  the former c.i.a. director  saw signs of russian election meddling. are his suggestive public statements signs that he knows information that he can’t divulge? washington — john o. brennan  the former director of the central intelligence agency  said wednesday that he thought russia may have some kind of compromising information on president trump  setting off furious speculation about whether the former spy chief was basing that assertion on inside information. in an appearance on wednesday on msnbc’s “morning joe ” mr. brennan  who served as c.i.a. director from 2013 to 2017  speculated that russians “may have something on him personally” when he was asked if he thought mr. trump was afraid of president vladimir v. putin of russia. “the russians  i think  have had long experience with mr. trump  and may have things that they could expose ” he added. mr. brennan was running the c.i.a. when a salacious dossier surfaced in 2016 that claimed the russians had compromising information on mr. trump. if there were any current or former american officials who might know if there was truth behind the allegations in the dossier  mr. brennan would most likely be one of them. and his comments came the day after a phone call mr. trump made to mr. putin congratulating him for winning an election raised new questions about the president’s relationship with russia. advertisement as c.i.a. director  mr. brennan was never known as particularly chatty around the news media or in public. and since leaving office  mr. brennan has taken to starting conversations with journalists by telling them  “i’m not going to be an anonymous source for any stories.” advertisement but last weekend  mr. brennan — in response to mr. trump’s praise for the firing of the former deputy director of the f.b.i.  andrew g. mccabe — issued a remarkable condemnation of the president. “when the full extent of your venality  moral turpitude  and political corruption becomes known  you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history ” mr. brennan wrote on twitter. mr. brennan’s pointed criticism of mr. trump on msnbc and on twitter was hardly unique. from the outset of the trump presidency  a litany of retired intelligence officials — the kind of people who have traditionally shied away from criticizing presidents  even in retirement — have come forward to criticize mr. trump. the former officials have included those like mr. brennan who served under democrats and others who served under republicans  such as michael hayden  who ran both the c.i.a. and the national security agency under president george w. bush. nearly all insist they have no desire to wade into partisan politics  but are genuinely alarmed by what they see as mr. trump’s fundamental disregard for the rule of law and his impetuous approach to the nation’s security. so mr. brennan’s latest accusations on wednesday quickly became fodder for news articles  social media conspiracy theories and hours of speculation on cable news channels. and his remarks seemed to go beyond what he had said publicly in january 2017  five days before he stepped down as c.i.a. director  when he had said the dossier was “unsubstantiated” and his criticism of mr. trump was relatively mild.  please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. view all new york times newsletters. “i don’t think he has a full appreciation of russian capabilities  russia’s intentions  and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world ” mr. brennan said then in an appearance on fox news. but later in the day on wednesday  mr. brennan explained that his comments were speculation based on mr. trump’s words and deeds  as well as how mr. putin’s government has operated at home and abroad — but not on any inside knowledge. “i do not know if the russians have something on donald trump that they could use as blackmail ” he said in a written response to questions from the new york times. “when asked the question  i have pointed out the perplexing submissiveness of mr. trump toward mr. putin — despite continued evidence of malign russian activities ” mr. brennan added. “i do not know why he refuses to call out russia; that is a question that can only be answered by mr. trump.” advertisement along with mr. brennan  who is a paid contributor to nbc and msnbc  other retired officials with contributor deals included james clapper jr.  the former director of national intelligence; steven l. hall  the former director of russia operations at the c.i.a.; and jeremy bash  a former c.i.a. and pentagon official. mr. hayden  in an interview  made the case for former intelligence officials becoming talking heads of a sort  saying he believed that it was important for americans to understand what the country’s intelligence agencies did and did not do. he also said he tries to bring the skills he learned as an intelligence officer to his public appearances  providing analysis based on facts. “lord knows cnn has enough people just throwing opinions ” said mr. hayden  who is a paid contributor to the network. “i try not working backward from assumption but build forward from data.” he added  “john has a right to say what he says — i also have trouble explaining events with regard to the president and russia.” a version of this article appears in print on march 22  2018  on page a16 of the new york edition with the headline: ex-chief of c.i.a. suggests putin may have compromising information on trump.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe   we’re interested in your feedback on this page. tell us what you think. go to home page » 
politics,advertisement supported by editorial by the editorial board the west’s response to russian aggression has usually been too little  too late  and devoid of the one voice that really matters — president trump’s. but at last  his administration is taking action  and mr. trump has spoken out  tentatively. on thursday the treasury department announced it was imposing sanctions for the kremlin’s interference in the 2016 election. officials have denounced the poisoning of a former russian spy in britain and russia’s devastating bombing missions in syria. while such steps are encouraging  only a more robust  unified response from the united states and its nato allies would impede president vladimir putin from expanding his pattern of heinous behavior. before leaving office  president barack obama expelled 35 russian diplomats  seized two diplomatic properties and imposed sanctions in response to the election interference. mr. trump  for reasons that have never been made completely clear  has until now resisted a congressional mandate that he expand the penalties. this was despite the warnings of intelligence agencies that russia is already trying to meddle in the 2018 election and congress’s near unanimous passage of the law demanding more sanctions. the sanctions announced on thursday affect five russian organizations and 19 individuals cited for spreading disinformation and propaganda to disrupt the election. while this was mr. trump’s most significant anti-russia move  these are the same entities identified by robert mueller  the special counsel investigating russian meddling  in a recent indictment and only add two new senior russian officials  with ties to military intelligence  to the list mr. obama sanctioned in 2016  according to representative adam schiff  the senior democrat on the house intelligence committee. the penalties need to go further  subjecting mr. putin’s wealthy cronies and their families to sanctions like travel bans and asset freezes that would put even more pressure on the russian leader. the administration also took the unusual step of citing the russian government for a previously unconfirmed series of intrusions into american power plants and the computer networks that control power grids that occurred about the time of the election. those attacks suggest russian state-sponsored hackers have been actively mapping out western industrial  power and nuclear facilities for eventual sabotage  experts say. while mr. trump said nothing on thursday about either the sanctions or russia’s interference in the election  he did end days of silence about the attack with a military-grade nerve agent against the former spy  sergei skripal  and his daughter  despite moscow’s denials. “it certainly looks like the russians were behind it ” he told reporters in the oval office. “something that should never ever happen. we’re taking it very seriously  as i think are many others.” but mr. trump’s comments came a full day after his united nations ambassador  nikki haley  took the lead with a more powerful statement at the security council. she insisted the united states stands in “absolute solidarity” with britain after the attack. russia’s use of chemical weapons on the soil of another united nations member is a “defining moment ” she said  and there is a need to “hold russia accountable.” and the piling on didn’t stop there. lt. gen. h. r. mcmaster  the national security adviser  whom mr. trump reportedly may fire  condemned russia in a speech on thursday for being “complicit in assad’s atrocities” in syria and conducting more than 100 bombing missions in eastern ghouta  as well as being “responsible” for the skripal poisoning. all of this occurred after prime minister theresa may announced plans to expel 23 russian spies and suspend high-level contact with moscow  and also joined the united states  france and germany in a statement denouncing russia’s action as a clear violation of international law. but the statement said nothing about joint action  and mrs. may’s measures either lacked details or didn’t go far enough. mr. putin  an authoritarian leader who is expected to be re-elected easily to another six-year term on sunday  has paid little or no price for his aggressions  including annexing crimea  destabilizing other parts of ukraine and enabling president bashar al-assad’s regime in syria. he won’t stop until he knows that the united states will stand up to him and work with its allies to impose stronger financial and diplomatic measures to rein him in. follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion)  and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.  advertisement    collapse see my options
